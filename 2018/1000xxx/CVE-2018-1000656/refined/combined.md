### @davidism **[davidism](/davidism)** commented [Apr 10, 2018](#issue-313002270)

`request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings. Incoming JSON must be encoded using a UTF-8, -16, or -32 codec. The current JSON spec says UTF-8 is the only valid encoding, although Flask is more forgiving. `json.detect_encoding` is added to automatically detect which UTF encoding was used, including BOM and endianness.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2722: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722
.. _2730: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730
.. _2731: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2731

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467

   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

   ```

   ### 0.2.1

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.12
   ```
   - Added registration of Flask CLI commands using `flask.commands`
      entrypoint group. (Jiri Kuncar)
    - Added an optional support for FlaskAzureStorage when
      `FLASK_ASSETS_USE_AZURE` is set.  (Alejo Arias)
    - Updated Flask extension imports for compatibility with Flask 0.11.
      (Andy Driver) (fixes 102)
    - Fixed generation of absolute urls using //. (fixes 73)
    - Fixed Flask-Script assets build command. (Frank Tackitt)
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - Match webassets 0.11.
    - Option to use Flask-CDN (James Elkins).
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.10.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.9.
    flask-assets now support Python 3, and drops support for Python 2.5.

    - Support for Flask-S3 (Erik Taubeneck).
    - Support latest Flask-Script (Chris Hacken).
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.8.

    - Flask-Script&#39;s ``build`` command now has ``--parse-templates`` option.
    - ``Environment`` class now has ``from_yaml`` and ``from_module``
      shortcuts (Sean Lynch).
    - Jinja2 filter uses the Flask template environment.
    - Fixed PySscss filter.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new
      extension import system, but using the compatibility module, older
      Flask versions should work fine as well:
      http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensions/
    - Support Python 2.5.
    - Allow customizing the backend of ``ManageAssets`` command.
    - Due to webassets 0.7, the cssrewrite filter now works with Blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.6.2
   ```
   - Fixed Blueprint/Module resolving in output path.
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   - Building in 0.6 was very much broken (thanks Oliver Tonnhofer).
    - A custom &quot;static_folder&quot; for a Flask app or Blueprint/Module is now
      supported.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   - Support webassets 0.6.
    - Fixed use of wrong Flask app in some cases.
    - Fixed init_app() usage (Oliver Tonnhofer)
    - Python 2.5 compatibility (Ron DuPlain)
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   - New version numbering scheme. The major and minor
      version numbers will now follow along with the version
      of webassets the Flask-Assets release was written
      against, and is guaranteed to be compatible with.
    - Support for Blueprints (Flask 0.7).
    - Fixed usage for incorrect request context during URL
      generation (thank you, julen).
   ```

   ### 0.2.2
   ```
   - Really fix the ManageAssets command.
   ```

   ### 0.2.1
   ```
   - Fixed the ManageAssets command to work with the current
      Flask-Script version.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   - Support for init_app() protocol, multiple applications.
    - Integrate with Flask-Script, provide management command.
    - Properly support Flask modules, with the ability to reference
      the module&#39;s static files in bundles (Olivier Poitrey).
   ```

   ### 0.1
   ```
   Initial release.
   ```

### Update [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF) from **0.14.2** to **0.14.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ```

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - **All new documentation!** nose&#39;s documentation is now generated by
  Sphinx. And thanks to Pam Zerbinos, it is much better organized and easier
  to use and read.
- Two new core commandline options can help with testing namespace
  packages. :option:`--first-package-wins` is useful when you want to test one
  part of a namespace package that uses another part; in previous versions of
  nose, the other part of the namespace package would be evicted from
  sys.modules when the 2nd loaded. :option:`--traverse-namespace` is useful if
  you want nose to discover tests across entries in a package&#39;s
  __path__. (This was formerly the default behavior).
- To make it easier to use custom plugins without needing setuptools,
  :func:`nose.core.main` and :func:`nose.core.run` now support an
  :doc:`addplugins &lt;doc_tests/test_addplugins/test_addplugins&gt;` keyword
  argument that takes a list of additional plugins to make available. **Note**
  that adding a plugin to this list **does not** activate or enable the
  plugin, only makes it available to be enabled via command-line or
  config file settings.
- Thanks to Kevin Mitchell, nose is now more compatible with
  IronPython. IronPython is still not fully supported, but it should work. If
  you&#39;d like to improve nose&#39;s support for IronPython further, please join the
  nose developer&#39;s list and volunteer to become the IronPython maintainer for
  nose!
- Added multiprocess plugin that allows tests to be run in parallel
  across multiple processes.
- Added logcapture plugin that captures logging messages and prints them with
  failing tests. Thanks to Max Ischenko for the implementation.
- Added optional HTML coverage reports to coverage plugin. Thanks to Augie
  Fackler for the patch.
- Added plugin that enables collection of tests in all modules. Thanks to
  Peter Fein for the patch (137).
- Added --failed option to testid plugin. When this option is in effect, if
  any tests failed in the previous test run (so long as testid was active for
  that test run) only the failed tests will run.
- Made it possible to &#39;yield test&#39; in addition to &#39;yield test,&#39; from test
  generators. Thanks to Chad Whitacre for the patch (230).
- Fixed bug that caused traceback inspector to fail when source code file
  could not be found. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch
  (236).
- Fixed some issues limiting compatibility with IronPython. Thanks to Kevin
  Mitchell for the patch.
- Added support for module and test case fixtures in doctest files (60).
- Added --traverse-namespace commandline option that restores old default
  behavior of following all package __path__ entries when loading tests from
  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the patch (167).
- Added --first-package-wins commandline option to better support testing
  parts of namespace packages. Thanks to Jason Coombs for the bug report
  (197).
- Added versioned nosetests scripts (123).
- Fixed bug that would cause context teardown to fail to run in some
  cases. Thanks to John Shaw for the bug report and patch (234).
- Enabled doctest plugin to use variable other than &quot;_&quot; as the default result
  variable. Thanks to Matt Good for the patch (163).
- Fixed bug that would cause unicode output to crash output capture. Thanks to
  schickb for the bug report (227).
- Added setUp and tearDown as valid names for module-level fixtures. Thanks to
  AgilityNerd for the patch (211).
- Fixed bug in list of valid names for package-level fixtures. Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey for the patch (237).
- Updated man page generation using hacked up manpage writer from
  docutils sandbox. Thanks grubertusers.sourceforge.net for the
  original module.
   ```

   ```
   - nose is now compatible with python 2.6.
   ```

   ### 0.10.3
   ```
   - Fixed bug in nosetests setup command that caused an exception to be raised
  if run with options. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report (191).
- Raised score of coverage plugin to 200, so that it will execute before
  default-score plugins, and so be able to catch more import-time code. Thanks
  to Ned Batchelder for the bug report and patch (190).
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   - nose now runs under jython (jython svn trunk only at this time). Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey, Pam Zerbinos and the other pycon sprinters (160).
- Fixed bugs in loader, default plugin manager, and other modules that
  caused plugin exceptions to be swallowed (152, 155). Thanks to John J
  Lee for the bug report and patch.
- Added selftest.py script, used to test a non-installed distribution of
  nose (49). Thanks to Antoine Pitrou and John J Lee for the bug report and
  patches.
- Fixed bug in nose.importer that caused errors with namespace
  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch (164).
- Fixed bug in nose.tools.with_setup that prevented use of multiple
  with_setup decorators. Thanks to tlesher for the bug report (151).
- Fixed bugs in handling of context fixtures for tests imported into a
  package. Thanks to Gary Bernhardt for the bug report (145).
- Fixed bugs in handling of config files and config file options for plugins
  excluded by a RestrictedPluginManager. Thanks to John J Lee and Philip
  Jenvey for the bug reports and patches (158, 166).
- Updated ErrorClass exception reporting to be shorter and more clear. Thanks
  to John J Lee for the patch (142).
- Allowed plugins to load tests from modules starting with &#39;_&#39;. Thanks to John
  J Lee for the patch (82).
- Updated documentation about building as rpm (127).
- Updated config to make including executable files the default on

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

  rob.daylife for the bug report and patch. (323).
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   - Changed plugin loading so that external plugins loaded via extension
  points can override builtin plugins with the same name.
- Updated multiprocess plugin and nose&#39;s packaging to allow multiprocess
  plugin to work on Windows (265).
- Fixed bug in xunit plugin&#39;s interaction with suites and errors in
  module-level setup. Thanks to Mark McCague for the bug report (279).
- Fixed bug in nose.loader.TestLoader that allowed Test classes that raise
  exceptions in __init__ to crash the test run (269).
- Fixed bugs in nose&#39;s test suite that caused spurious failures on Windows.
- Fixed bug in twisted tools: delayed calls were not shut down on
  reactor stop. Thanks to abbeyj for the patch (278).
- Fixed bug where root log handlers were not cleared. For example, this was
  emitting unwanted messages when testing Google App Engine websites.
- Fixed bug in test names output by xunit plugin. Thanks to Philip
  Jenvey for the bug report and patch (280).
- Fixed bug in profile plugin that caused stats to fail to print under Python
  2.5 and later. Thanks to djs at n-cube dot org for the bug report (285).
- Improved logcapture filtering, with default setting to filter out log
  messages from nose itself. Thanks to gfxmonk for the patch (277).
- The xunit plugin now tags skipped tests with a &lt;skipped&gt; testcase tag, and
  prevents the XML from containing invalid control characters.
- Updated nose to be compatible with python 2.7 (305).
- Updated loading of usage document to allow nose to run from within
  an egg archive (288).
- Fixed IronPython checks to make nose compatible with more versions
  of IronPython. Thanks to Kevin Mitchell for the patch (316).
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   - Fixed bug in xunit plugin xml escaping. Thanks to Nat Williams for the bug
  report (266).
- Fixed bug in xunit plugin that could cause test run to crash after certain
  types of errors or actions by other plugins.
- Fixed bug in testid plugin that could cause test run to crash after certain
  types of errors or actions by other plugins.
- Fixed bug in collect only plugin that caused it to fail when collecting from
  test generators.
- Fixed some broken html in docs.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - **All new documentation!** nose&#39;s documentation is now generated by
  Sphinx. And thanks to Pam Zerbinos, it is much better organized and easier
  to use and read.
- Two new core commandline options can help with testing namespace
  packages. :option:`--first-package-wins` is useful when you want to test one
  part of a namespace package that uses another part; in previous versions of
  nose, the other part of the namespace package would be evicted from
  sys.modules when the 2nd loaded. :option:`--traverse-namespace` is useful if
  you want nose to discover tests across entries in a package&#39;s
  __path__. (This was formerly the default behavior).
- To make it easier to use custom plugins without needing setuptools,
  :func:`nose.core.main` and :func:`nose.core.run` now support an
  :doc:`addplugins &lt;doc_tests/test_addplugins/test_addplugins&gt;` keyword
  argument that takes a list of additional plugins to make available. **Note**
  that adding a plugin to this list **does not** activate or enable the
  plugin, only makes it available to be enabled via command-line or
  config file settings.
- Thanks to Kevin Mitchell, nose is now more compatible with
  IronPython. IronPython is still not fully supported, but it should work. If
  you&#39;d like to improve nose&#39;s support for IronPython further, please join the
  nose developer&#39;s list and volunteer to become the IronPython maintainer for
  nose!
- Added multiprocess plugin that allows tests to be run in parallel
  across multiple processes.
- Added logcapture plugin that captures logging messages and prints them with
  failing tests. Thanks to Max Ischenko for the implementation.
- Added optional HTML coverage reports to coverage plugin. Thanks to Augie
  Fackler for the patch.
- Added plugin that enables collection of tests in all modules. Thanks to
  Peter Fein for the patch (137).
- Added --failed option to testid plugin. When this option is in effect, if
  any tests failed in the previous test run (so long as testid was active for
  that test run) only the failed tests will run.
- Made it possible to &#39;yield test&#39; in addition to &#39;yield test,&#39; from test
  generators. Thanks to Chad Whitacre for the patch (230).
- Fixed bug that caused traceback inspector to fail when source code file
  could not be found. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch
  (236).
- Fixed some issues limiting compatibility with IronPython. Thanks to Kevin
  Mitchell for the patch.
- Added support for module and test case fixtures in doctest files (60).
- Added --traverse-namespace commandline option that restores old default
  behavior of following all package __path__ entries when loading tests from
  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the patch (167).
- Added --first-package-wins commandline option to better support testing
  parts of namespace packages. Thanks to Jason Coombs for the bug report
  (197).
- Added versioned nosetests scripts (123).
- Fixed bug that would cause context teardown to fail to run in some
  cases. Thanks to John Shaw for the bug report and patch (234).
- Enabled doctest plugin to use variable other than &quot;_&quot; as the default result
  variable. Thanks to Matt Good for the patch (163).
- Fixed bug that would cause unicode output to crash output capture. Thanks to
  schickb for the bug report (227).
- Added setUp and tearDown as valid names for module-level fixtures. Thanks to
  AgilityNerd for the patch (211).
- Fixed bug in list of valid names for package-level fixtures. Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey for the patch (237).
- Updated man page generation using hacked up manpage writer from
  docutils sandbox. Thanks grubertusers.sourceforge.net for the
  original module.
   ```

   ### 0.10.4
   ```
   - nose is now compatible with python 2.6.
   ```

   ### 0.10.3
   ```
   - Fixed bug in nosetests setup command that caused an exception to be raised
  if run with options. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report (191).
- Raised score of coverage plugin to 200, so that it will execute before
  default-score plugins, and so be able to catch more import-time code. Thanks
  to Ned Batchelder for the bug report and patch (190).
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   - nose now runs under jython (jython svn trunk only at this time). Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey, Pam Zerbinos and the other pycon sprinters (160).

  caused plugin exceptions to be swallowed (152, 155). Thanks to John J
  Lee for the bug report and patch.
- Added selftest.py script, used to test a non-installed distribution of
  nose (49). Thanks to Antoine Pitrou and John J Lee for the bug report and
  patches.

  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch (164).
- Fixed bug in nose.tools.with_setup that prevented use of multiple
  with_setup decorators. Thanks to tlesher for the bug report (151).
- Fixed bugs in handling of context fixtures for tests imported into a
  package. Thanks to Gary Bernhardt for the bug report (145).
- Fixed bugs in handling of config files and config file options for plugins
  excluded by a RestrictedPluginManager. Thanks to John J Lee and Philip
  Jenvey for the bug reports and patches (158, 166).

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

  rob.daylife for the bug report and patch. (323).
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   - Changed plugin loading so that external plugins loaded via extension
  points can override builtin plugins with the same name.
- Updated multiprocess plugin and nose&#39;s packaging to allow multiprocess
  plugin to work on Windows (265).
- Fixed bug in xunit plugin&#39;s interaction with suites and errors in
  module-level setup. Thanks to Mark McCague for the bug report (279).
- Fixed bug in nose.loader.TestLoader that allowed Test classes that raise
  exceptions in __init__ to crash the test run (269).
- Fixed bugs in nose&#39;s test suite that caused spurious failures on Windows.
- Fixed bug in twisted tools: delayed calls were not shut down on
  reactor stop. Thanks to abbeyj for the patch (278).
- Fixed bug where root log handlers were not cleared. For example, this was
  emitting unwanted messages when testing Google App Engine websites.
- Fixed bug in test names output by xunit plugin. Thanks to Philip
  Jenvey for the bug report and patch (280).
- Fixed bug in profile plugin that caused stats to fail to print under Python
  2.5 and later. Thanks to djs at n-cube dot org for the bug report (285).
- Improved logcapture filtering, with default setting to filter out log
  messages from nose itself. Thanks to gfxmonk for the patch (277).

  prevents the XML from containing invalid control characters.
- Updated nose to be compatible with python 2.7 (305).
- Updated loading of usage document to allow nose to run from within
  an egg archive (288).

   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   - Fixed bug in xunit plugin xml escaping. Thanks to Nat Williams for the bug
  report (266).
- Fixed bug in xunit plugin that could cause test run to crash after certain
  types of errors or actions by other plugins.

  test generators.
- Fixed some broken html in docs.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - **All new documentation!** nose&#39;s documentation is now generated by
  Sphinx. And thanks to Pam Zerbinos, it is much better organized and easier
  to use and read.
- Two new core commandline options can help with testing namespace
  packages. :option:`--first-package-wins` is useful when you want to test one
  part of a namespace package that uses another part; in previous versions of
  nose, the other part of the namespace package would be evicted from
  sys.modules when the 2nd loaded. :option:`--traverse-namespace` is useful if
  you want nose to discover tests across entries in a package&#39;s
  __path__. (This was formerly the default behavior).
- To make it easier to use custom plugins without needing setuptools,
  :func:`nose.core.main` and :func:`nose.core.run` now support an
  :doc:`addplugins &lt;doc_tests/test_addplugins/test_addplugins&gt;` keyword
  argument that takes a list of additional plugins to make available. **Note**
  that adding a plugin to this list **does not** activate or enable the
  plugin, only makes it available to be enabled via command-line or
  config file settings.
- Thanks to Kevin Mitchell, nose is now more compatible with
  IronPython. IronPython is still not fully supported, but it should work. If
  you&#39;d like to improve nose&#39;s support for IronPython further, please join the
  nose developer&#39;s list and volunteer to become the IronPython maintainer for
  nose!
- Added multiprocess plugin that allows tests to be run in parallel
  across multiple processes.
- Added logcapture plugin that captures logging messages and prints them with
  failing tests. Thanks to Max Ischenko for the implementation.
- Added optional HTML coverage reports to coverage plugin. Thanks to Augie
  Fackler for the patch.
- Added plugin that enables collection of tests in all modules. Thanks to
  Peter Fein for the patch (137).
- Added --failed option to testid plugin. When this option is in effect, if
  any tests failed in the previous test run (so long as testid was active for
  that test run) only the failed tests will run.
- Made it possible to &#39;yield test&#39; in addition to &#39;yield test,&#39; from test
  generators. Thanks to Chad Whitacre for the patch (230).
- Fixed bug that caused traceback inspector to fail when source code file
  could not be found. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch
  (236).
- Fixed some issues limiting compatibility with IronPython. Thanks to Kevin
  Mitchell for the patch.
- Added support for module and test case fixtures in doctest files (60).
- Added --traverse-namespace commandline option that restores old default
  behavior of following all package __path__ entries when loading tests from
  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the patch (167).
- Added --first-package-wins commandline option to better support testing
  parts of namespace packages. Thanks to Jason Coombs for the bug report
  (197).
- Added versioned nosetests scripts (123).
- Fixed bug that would cause context teardown to fail to run in some
  cases. Thanks to John Shaw for the bug report and patch (234).
- Enabled doctest plugin to use variable other than &quot;_&quot; as the default result
  variable. Thanks to Matt Good for the patch (163).
- Fixed bug that would cause unicode output to crash output capture. Thanks to
  schickb for the bug report (227).
- Added setUp and tearDown as valid names for module-level fixtures. Thanks to
  AgilityNerd for the patch (211).
- Fixed bug in list of valid names for package-level fixtures. Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey for the patch (237).
- Updated man page generation using hacked up manpage writer from
  docutils sandbox. Thanks grubertusers.sourceforge.net for the
  original module.
   ```

   ### 0.10.4
   ```
   - nose is now compatible with python 2.6.
   ```

   ### 0.10.3
   ```
   - Fixed bug in nosetests setup command that caused an exception to be raised
  if run with options. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report (191).
- Raised score of coverage plugin to 200, so that it will execute before
  default-score plugins, and so be able to catch more import-time code. Thanks
  to Ned Batchelder for the bug report and patch (190).
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   - nose now runs under jython (jython svn trunk only at this time). Thanks to
  Philip Jenvey, Pam Zerbinos and the other pycon sprinters (160).
- Fixed bugs in loader, default plugin manager, and other modules that
  caused plugin exceptions to be swallowed (152, 155). Thanks to John J
  Lee for the bug report and patch.
- Added selftest.py script, used to test a non-installed distribution of
  nose (49). Thanks to Antoine Pitrou and John J Lee for the bug report and
  patches.
- Fixed bug in nose.importer that caused errors with namespace
  packages. Thanks to Philip Jenvey for the bug report and patch (164).
- Fixed bug in nose.tools.with_setup that prevented use of multiple
  with_setup decorators. Thanks to tlesher for the bug report (151).
- Fixed bugs in handling of context fixtures for tests imported into a
  package. Thanks to Gary Bernhardt for the bug report (145).
- Fixed bugs in handling of config files and config file options for plugins
  excluded by a RestrictedPluginManager. Thanks to John J Lee and Philip
  Jenvey for the bug reports and patches (158, 166).
- Updated ErrorClass exception reporting to be shorter and more clear. Thanks
  to John J Lee for the patch (142).
- Allowed plugins to load tests from modules starting with &#39;_&#39;. Thanks to John
  J Lee for the patch (82).
- Updated documentation about building as rpm (127).
- Updated config to make including executable files the default on
  IronPython…

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for easier debugging

**Dependencies**

- We now support idna v2.6.
   ```

   ### 2.18.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Running ``$ python -m requests.help`` now includes the installed version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue where Requests would raise ``ConnectionError`` instead of
  ``SSLError`` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- ``requests.help`` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
  ``ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER``.

**Dependencies**

- We now support urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix an error in the packaging whereby the *.whl contained incorrect data that
  regressed the fix in v2.17.3.
   ```

   ### 2.18.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- ``Response`` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a ``with`` statement
  without first having to be wrapped by ``contextlib.closing()``.

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
- Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the number of CPU cores
- Resolve error swallowing in utils set_environ generator
   ```

   ### 2.17.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.
   ```

   ### 2.16.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.
   ```

   ### 2.16.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!
   ```

   ### 2.16.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
   ```

   ### 2.16.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have
  the underlying connection clo…")[#28](https://github.com/hasgeek/eventframe/pull/28)[)](/hasgeek/eventframe/commit/26672b96e66b3982bece8247f562b81a6658a5f4 "Initial Update (#28)

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
   ```

   ### 2.16.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have
  the underlying connection clo…")`

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for easier debugging

**Dependencies**

- We now support idna v2.6.
   ```

   ### 2.18.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Running ``$ python -m requests.help`` now includes the installed version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue where Requests would raise ``ConnectionError`` instead of
  ``SSLError`` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- ``requests.help`` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
  ``ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER``.

**Dependencies**

- We now support urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix an error in the packaging whereby the *.whl contained incorrect data that
  regressed the fix in v2.17.3.
   ```

   ### 2.18.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- ``Response`` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a ``with`` statement
  without first having to be wrapped by ``contextlib.closing()``.

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
- Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the number of CPU cores
- Resolve error swallowing in utils set_environ generator
   ```

   ### 2.17.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.
   ```

   ### 2.16.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.
   ```

   ### 2.16.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!
   ```

   ### 2.16.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
   ```

   ### 2.16.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have
  the underlying connection clo…

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2722: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722
.. _2730: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730

.. _2736: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2736
.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-Sqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Sqlalchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.
    (`2666`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.

### Update [Flask-Sqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Sqlalchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

      entrypoint group. (Jiri Kuncar)

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new

      against, and is guaranteed to be compatible with.
    - Support for Blueprints (Flask 0.7).
    - Fixed usage for incorrect request context during URL
      generation (thank you, julen).
   ```

   ### 0.2.2
   ```
   - Really fix the ManageAssets command.
   ```

   ### 0.2.1
   ```
   - Fixed the ManageAssets command to work with the current
      Flask-Script version.
   ```

   ```
   - Support for init_app() protocol, multiple applications.
    - Integrate with Flask-Script, provide management command.
    - Properly support Flask modules, with the ability to reference

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ```

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-Sqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Sqlalchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

   ### 0.12
   ```
   - Added registration of Flask CLI commands using `flask.commands`
      entrypoint group. (Jiri Kuncar)
    - Added an optional support for FlaskAzureStorage when
      `FLASK_ASSETS_USE_AZURE` is set.  (Alejo Arias)
    - Updated Flask extension imports for compatibility with Flask 0.11.
      (Andy Driver) (fixes 102)
    - Fixed generation of absolute urls using //. (fixes 73)
    - Fixed Flask-Script assets build command. (Frank Tackitt)
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - Match webassets 0.11.
    - Option to use Flask-CDN (James Elkins).
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.10.
   ```

   This release is compatible with webassets 0.9.
    flask-assets now support Python 3, and drops support for Python 2.5.

    - Support for Flask-S3 (Erik Taubeneck).
    - Support latest Flask-Script (Chris Hacken).
   ```

   ### 0.8

   This release is compatible with webassets 0.8.

    - Flask-Script&#39;s ``build`` command now has ``--parse-templates`` option.
    - ``Environment`` class now has ``from_yaml`` and ``from_module``
      shortcuts (Sean Lynch).
    - Jinja2 filter uses the Flask template environment.
    - Fixed PySscss filter.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new
      extension import system, but using the compatibility module, older
      Flask versions should work fine as well:
      http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensions/
    - Support Python 2.5.
    - Allow customizing the backend of ``ManageAssets`` command.
    - Due to webassets 0.7, the cssrewrite filter now works with Blueprints.

   ### 0.6.2
   ```
   - Fixed Blueprint/Module resolving in output path.
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```

      against, and is guaranteed to be compatible with.
    - Support for Blueprints (Flask 0.7).

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ```

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

   package notation, using the coverage plugin with multiprocessing, and several
others.  See the CHANGELOG for more details.

Also note that nose 1.x is in maintenance mode.  We will not be
looking to add any features, and you should seriously consider
looking at nose2 as the way forward.

If you&#39;re interested in the future of nose, please take a look at the
nose2 project on github (https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2/0.5.0).

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2722: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722
.. _2730: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730
.. _2731: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2731

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2722: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722
.. _2730: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2730
.. _2731: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2731

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for easier debugging

**Dependencies**

- We now support idna v2.6.
   ```

   ### 2.18.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Running ``$ python -m requests.help`` now includes the installed version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue where Requests would raise ``ConnectionError`` instead of
  ``SSLError`` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- ``requests.help`` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
  ``ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER``.

**Dependencies**

- We now support urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix an error in the packaging whereby the *.whl contained incorrect data that
  regressed the fix in v2.17.3.
   ```

   ### 2.18.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- ``Response`` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a ``with`` statement
  without first having to be wrapped by ``contextlib.closing()``.

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
- Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the number of CPU cores
- Resolve error swallowing in utils set_environ generator
   ```

   ### 2.17.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.
   ```

   ### 2.16.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.
   ```

   ### 2.16.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!
   ```

   ### 2.16.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
   ```

   ### 2.16.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1

   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0

  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue wh…")[#170](https://github.com/hasgeek/hasgeek.tv/pull/170)[)](/hasgeek/hasgeek.tv/commit/42508f703c319d66cdaea1651e57751430257a64 "Initial Update (#170)

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)

    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue wh…")`

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.1
   ```
   -----------

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless

- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for easier debugging

**Dependencies**

- We now support idna v2.6.
   ```

   ### 2.18.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Running ``$ python -m requests.help`` now includes the installed version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed issue where Requests would raise ``ConnectionError`` instead of
  ``SSLError`` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- ``requests.help`` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
  ``ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER``.

**Dependencies**

- We now support urllib3 v1.22.
   ```

   ### 2.18.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fix an error in the packaging whereby the *.whl contained incorrect data that
  regressed the fix in v2.17.3.
   ```

   ### 2.18.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- ``Response`` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a ``with`` statement
  without first having to be wrapped by ``contextlib.closing()``.

**Bugfixes**

- Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
- Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the number of CPU cores
- Resolve error swallowing in utils set_environ generator
   ```

   ### 2.17.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Improved ``packages`` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.
   ```

   ### 2.17.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.
   ```

   ### 2.16.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Improvements to ``$ python -m requests.help``.
   ```

   ### 2.16.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Introduction of the ``$ python -m requests.help`` command, for debugging with maintainers!
   ```

   ### 2.16.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
   ```

   ### 2.16.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Further restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be neccessary any longer.
   ```

   ### 2.16.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Restored the ``requests.packages`` namespace for compatibility reasons.
- Bugfix for ``urllib3`` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the ``requests.packages``
namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level
now.

For example::

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be::

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better::

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
   ```

   ### 2.16.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Unvendor ALL the things!
   ```

   ### 2.15.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

- Everyone makes mistakes.
   ```

   ### 2.15.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Introduction of the ``Response.next`` property, for getting the next
  ``PreparedResponse`` from a redirect chain (when ``allow_redirects=False``).
- Internal refactoring of ``__version__`` module.

**Bugfixes**

- Restored once-optional parameter for ``requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()``.
   ```

   ### 2.14.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to
  widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
  releases.
   ```

   ### 2.14.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- It is now possible to pass ``no_proxy`` as a key to the ``proxies``
  dictionary to provide handling similar to the ``NO_PROXY`` environment
  variable.
- When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories
  Requests now raises ``IOError``, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS
  request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
- The behavior of ``SessionRedirectMixin`` was slightly altered.
  ``resolve_redirects`` will now detect a redirect by calling
  ``get_redirect_target(response)`` instead of directly
  querying ``Response.is_redirect`` and ``Response.headers[&#39;location&#39;]``.
  Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
- Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher
  resolution on Windows.
- Added ``win_inet_pton`` as conditional dependency for the ``[socks]`` extra
  on Windows with Python 2.7.
- Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
  check doesn&#39;t use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
- URLs with schemes that begin with ``http`` but are not ``http`` or ``https``
  no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

- Much improved handling of non-ASCII ``Location`` header values in redirects.
  Fewer ``UnicodeDecodeErrors`` are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now
  correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
- If an attempt to ``seek`` file to find out its length fails, we now
  appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
- Restricted ``HTTPDigestAuth`` to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX
  responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
- Fixed some code that was firing ``DeprecationWarning`` on Python 3.6.
- The dismayed person emoticon (``/o\\``) no longer has a big head. I&#39;m sure
  this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
- Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
- Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
- Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.
   ```

   ### 2.13.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- Only load the ``idna`` library when we&#39;ve determined we need it. This will
  save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
- Updated bundled idna to 2.2.
   ```

   ### 2.12.5
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
  big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.
   ```

   ### 2.12.4
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the
  basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been readded,
  the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
   ```

   ### 2.12.3
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with &quot;http&quot;.
  These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed
  URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an
  overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This
  change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to
  be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
   ```

   ### 2.12.2
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but
  which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if
  it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will
  be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using
  IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid
  but still common hostnames.
- Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
  ``InvalidSchema`` errors.
- Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still
  have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
- Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
- Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a
  Response object would cause ``Response.content`` to raise an
  ``AttributeError``.
   ```

   ### 2.12.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Updated setuptools &#39;security&#39; extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.
   ```

   ### 2.12.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008.
  This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory
  for .de domains.
- Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no
  longer read an entire ``StringIO`` into memory.
- Much improved logic for recalculating ``Content-Length`` headers for
  ``PreparedRequest`` objects.
- Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no ``tell`` method but
  do have a ``seek`` method.
- Anything that is a subclass of ``Mapping`` is now treated like a dictionary
  by the ``data=`` keyword argument.
- Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than
  stripping the credentials.
- If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is
  redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to
  rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

- When calling ``response.close``, the call to ``close`` will be propagated
  through to non-urllib3 backends.
- Fixed issue where the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable would be preferred
  over scheme-specific variables like ``HTTP_PROXY``.
- Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling
  back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
- Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when
  using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native
  string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

- Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
- Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.
   ```

   ### 2.11.1
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a bug when using ``iter_content`` with ``decode_unicode=True`` for
  streamed bodies would raise ``AttributeError``. This bug was introduced in
  2.11.
- Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when
  following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.
   ```

   ### 2.11.0
   ```
   +++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added support for the ``ALL_PROXY`` environment variable.
- Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to
  reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed occasional ``TypeError`` when attempting to decode a JSON response that
  occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a ``ValueError``.
- Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the ``NO_PROXY``
  environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
- Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure
  OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
- Added type checks to ensure that ``iter_content`` only accepts integers and
  ``None`` for chunk sizes.
- Fixed issue wh…

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

   ### 0.5.0
   ```
   ------------------

This version represents a major rewrite and refactoring of the code base
that also adds features and fixes many bugs. All functionality and
nearly all unit tests have been preserved. However, some backwards
incompatible changes to the API have been made.

Below is a selection of some of the changes (not exhaustive).

Highlights:

-   Pystache now passes all tests in version 1.0.3 of the [Mustache
    spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec). [pvande]
-   Removed View class: it is no longer necessary to subclass from View
    or from any other class to create a view.
-   Replaced Template with Renderer class: template rendering behavior
    can be modified via the Renderer constructor or by setting
    attributes on a Renderer instance.
-   Added TemplateSpec class: template rendering can be specified on a
    per-view basis by subclassing from TemplateSpec.
-   Introduced separation of concerns and removed circular dependencies
    (e.g. between Template and View classes, cf. [issue
    \13](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/issues/13)).
-   Unicode now used consistently throughout the rendering process.
-   Expanded test coverage: nosetests now runs doctests and \~105 test
    cases from the Mustache spec (increasing the number of tests from 56
    to \~315).
-   Added a rudimentary benchmarking script to gauge performance while
    refactoring.
-   Extensive documentation added (e.g. docstrings).

Other changes:

-   Added a command-line interface. [vrde]
-   The main rendering class now accepts a custom partial loader (e.g. a
    dictionary) and a custom escape function.
-   Non-ascii characters in str strings are now supported while
    rendering.
-   Added string encoding, file encoding, and errors options for
    decoding to unicode.
-   Removed the output encoding option.
-   Removed the use of markupsafe.

Bug fixes:

-   Context values no longer processed as template strings.
    [jakearchibald]
-   Whitespace surrounding sections is no longer altered, per the spec.
    [heliodor]
-   Zeroes now render correctly when using PyPy. [alex]
-   Multline comments now permitted. [fczuardi]
-   Extensionless template files are now supported.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` no longer modifies the context.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` with no context no longer raises
    an exception.
   ```

   ### 0.4.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Added support for Python 2.4. [wangtz, jvantuyl]
   ```

   ### 0.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Add support for nested contexts (within template and view)
-   Add support for inverted lists
-   Decoupled template loading
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Fix package
   ```

   ### 0.3.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   View.template\_path can now hold a list of path
-   Add {{&amp; blah}} as an alias for {{{ blah }}}
-   Higher Order Sections
-   Inverted sections
   ```

   ### 0.2.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Bugfix: Methods returning False or None are not rendered
-   Bugfix: Don&#39;t render an empty string when a tag&#39;s value is 0.
    [enaeseth]
-   Add support for using non-callables as View attributes.
    [joshthecoder]
-   Allow using View instances as attributes. [joshthecoder]
-   Support for Unicode and non-ASCII-encoded bytestring output.

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

   ### 0.5.0
   ```
   ------------------

This version represents a major rewrite and refactoring of the code base
that also adds features and fixes many bugs. All functionality and
nearly all unit tests have been preserved. However, some backwards
incompatible changes to the API have been made.

Below is a selection of some of the changes (not exhaustive).

Highlights:

-   Pystache now passes all tests in version 1.0.3 of the [Mustache
    spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec). [pvande]
-   Removed View class: it is no longer necessary to subclass from View
    or from any other class to create a view.
-   Replaced Template with Renderer class: template rendering behavior
    can be modified via the Renderer constructor or by setting
    attributes on a Renderer instance.
-   Added TemplateSpec class: template rendering can be specified on a
    per-view basis by subclassing from TemplateSpec.
-   Introduced separation of concerns and removed circular dependencies
    (e.g. between Template and View classes, cf. [issue
    \13](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/issues/13)).
-   Unicode now used consistently throughout the rendering process.
-   Expanded test coverage: nosetests now runs doctests and \~105 test
    cases from the Mustache spec (increasing the number of tests from 56
    to \~315).
-   Added a rudimentary benchmarking script to gauge performance while
    refactoring.
-   Extensive documentation added (e.g. docstrings).

Other changes:

-   Added a command-line interface. [vrde]
-   The main rendering class now accepts a custom partial loader (e.g. a
    dictionary) and a custom escape function.
-   Non-ascii characters in str strings are now supported while
    rendering.
-   Added string encoding, file encoding, and errors options for
    decoding to unicode.
-   Removed the output encoding option.
-   Removed the use of markupsafe.

Bug fixes:

-   Context values no longer processed as template strings.
    [jakearchibald]
-   Whitespace surrounding sections is no longer altered, per the spec.
    [heliodor]
-   Zeroes now render correctly when using PyPy. [alex]
-   Multline comments now permitted. [fczuardi]
-   Extensionless template files are now supported.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` no longer modifies the context.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` with no context no longer raises
    an exception.
   ```

   ### 0.4.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Added support for Python 2.4. [wangtz, jvantuyl]
   ```

   ### 0.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Add support for nested contexts (within template and view)
-   Add support for inverted lists
-   Decoupled template loading
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Fix package
   ```

   ### 0.3.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   View.template\_path can now hold a list of path
-   Add {{&amp; blah}} as an alias for {{{ blah }}}
-   Higher Order Sections
-   Inverted sections
   ```

   ### 0.2.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Bugfix: Methods returning False or None are not rendered
-   Bugfix: Don&#39;t render an empty string when a tag&#39;s value is 0.
    [enaeseth]
-   Add support for using non-callables as View attributes.
    [joshthecoder]
-   Allow using View instances as attributes. [joshthecoder]
-   Support for Unicode and non-ASCII-encoded bytestring output.

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```

   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

   ```

   ### 0.5.0
   ```
   ------------------

This version represents a major rewrite and refactoring of the code base
that also adds features and fixes many bugs. All functionality and
nearly all unit tests have been preserved. However, some backwards
incompatible changes to the API have been made.

Below is a selection of some of the changes (not exhaustive).

Highlights:

-   Pystache now passes all tests in version 1.0.3 of the [Mustache
    spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec). [pvande]
-   Removed View class: it is no longer necessary to subclass from View
    or from any other class to create a view.
-   Replaced Template with Renderer class: template rendering behavior
    can be modified via the Renderer constructor or by setting
    attributes on a Renderer instance.
-   Added TemplateSpec class: template rendering can be specified on a
    per-view basis by subclassing from TemplateSpec.
-   Introduced separation of concerns and removed circular dependencies
    (e.g. between Template and View classes, cf. [issue
    \13](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache/issues/13)).
-   Unicode now used consistently throughout the rendering process.
-   Expanded test coverage: nosetests now runs doctests and \~105 test
    cases from the Mustache spec (increasing the number of tests from 56
    to \~315).
-   Added a rudimentary benchmarking script to gauge performance while
    refactoring.
-   Extensive documentation added (e.g. docstrings).

Other changes:

-   Added a command-line interface. [vrde]
-   The main rendering class now accepts a custom partial loader (e.g. a
    dictionary) and a custom escape function.
-   Non-ascii characters in str strings are now supported while
    rendering.
-   Added string encoding, file encoding, and errors options for
    decoding to unicode.
-   Removed the output encoding option.
-   Removed the use of markupsafe.

Bug fixes:

-   Context values no longer processed as template strings.
    [jakearchibald]
-   Whitespace surrounding sections is no longer altered, per the spec.
    [heliodor]
-   Zeroes now render correctly when using PyPy. [alex]
-   Multline comments now permitted. [fczuardi]
-   Extensionless template files are now supported.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` no longer modifies the context.
-   Passing `**kwargs` to `Template()` with no context no longer raises
    an exception.
   ```

   ### 0.4.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Added support for Python 2.4. [wangtz, jvantuyl]
   ```

   ### 0.4.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Add support for nested contexts (within template and view)
-   Add support for inverted lists
-   Decoupled template loading
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   ------------------

-   Fix package
   ```

   ### 0.3.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   View.template\_path can now hold a list of path
-   Add {{&amp; blah}} as an alias for {{{ blah }}}
-   Higher Order Sections
-   Inverted sections
   ```

   ### 0.2.0
   ```
   ------------------

-   Bugfix: Methods returning False or None are not rendered
-   Bugfix: Don&#39;t render an empty string when a tag&#39;s value is 0.
    [enaeseth]
-   Add support for using non-callables as View attributes.
    [joshthecoder]
-   Allow using View instances as attributes. [joshthecoder]
-   Support for Unicode and non-ASCII-encoded bytestring output.
    [enaeseth]
-   Template fil…

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373
.. _409: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/409

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

others.  See the CHANGELOG for more details.

Also note that nose 1.x is in maintenance mode.  We will not be
looking to add any features, and you should seriously consider
looking at nose2 as the way forward.

If you&#39;re interested in the future of nose, please take a look at the
nose2 project on github (https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2/0.5.0).

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373
.. _409: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/409
.. _443: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/443
.. _460: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/460
.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ```
   ------------

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.1
   ```
   -----------

Released on October 23rd 2015, codename Caesium

- Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
  subclassing mixins and abstract models.

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0

- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

- applied changes to pass the Flask extension approval process.
   ```

   ### 0.8

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

Released on April 29 2018

-   Repackage 0.12.3 to fix package layout issue. (`2728`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.
    (`2666`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases.

   ```

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2722: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2722

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0

### Update [phonenumbers](https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers) from **8.9.7** to **8.9.7**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 8.8.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 7e4e754bda09](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/7e4e754bda09);
relevant code changes:

 - Improve parsing logic to be smarter about national-prefix detection &amp;
   stripping based on possible-lengths (`IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`). Enables e.g. adding Iran short-codes starting with &quot;096&quot;
   without the need to hack IR&#39;s national prefix parsing config.
   ```

   ### 8.7.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fb9aa53ecfa3](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fb9aa53ecfa3);
relevant code changes:

 - Documentation fix for `number_type`
   ```

   ### 8.7.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1ad92eb35a44](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1ad92eb35a44);
relevant code changes:

 - New method `supported_calling_codes()` API to return all the calling codes
   that the library considers valid, both for geographical and non-geographical
   entities.
 - Added `is_sms_service_for_region(numobj, region_dialing_from)` API in
   short number info library. An SMS service is where the primary or only
   intended usage is to receive and/or send text messages (SMSs). This includes
   MMS as MMS numbers downgrade to SMS if the other party isn&#39;t MMS-capable. The
   `is_sms_service` metadata is also serialized for the first time.
 - Documentation update for private variables `_VALID_PUNCTUATION` and
   `_SINGLE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`, also renaming the latter from
   `_UNIQUE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`.
   ```

   ### 8.6.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 242a186f1fbf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/242a186f1fbf);
relevant code changes:

 - Removing `leading_zero_possible` from the metadata and all the places it is
   referenced in the build and prod code. Will be removed from the metadata
   proto itself in a subsequent release. This should not affect users of the
   library - the only place it was used was `format_in_original_format`, and only
   initially to try and avoid modifying the input number by removing/adding
   digits inadvertently. Now this is checked at the end of the method anyway.
   However slight formatting differences with this method on invalid numbers
   starting with 0s may be noticed in some countries.
 - Updated the documentation for the `is_number_geographical` API.
 - Small comment improvements for `parse()` method to point users at
   `keep_raw_input` parameter.
 - Added a new enum for `CountryCodeSource` called `UNSPECIFIED`. This is used as a
   default value, and will be returned if someone calls `parse(keep_raw_input=False)` and then
   `.country_code_sourc` on the result. If users want an actual value for this
   then they should call `parse(keep_raw_input=True)` instead; the values that were
   previously returned after calling this method will not change.
 - Deletion of the possible number pattern in the phonemetadata.proto file and
   all generated code. This has not been used for a long time.
   ```

   ### 8.5.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 52cff9d8837f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/52cff9d8837f);
relevant code changes:

 - Add `can_be_internationally_dialled` public API; This was already in JS.
   ```

   ### 8.4.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 9923d9211432](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/9923d9211432);
relevant code changes:

 - Small fix for possible out-of-bounds exception on RFC3966 input where no
   phone context was actually provided.
   ```

   ### 8.4.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 02dbc0921cf5](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/02dbc0921cf5);
relevant code changes:

 - Changing `is_possible_with_reason` to return the enums `INVALID_LENGTH` and
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY`, where these apply. `is_possible_number` continues to
   consider `IS_POSSIBLE` or `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` numbers as possible to dial.
   Announcement: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libphonenumber-discuss/sPhYzdzFCmg/6tYsS1f6DgAJ
 - Doc updates for `region_code_for_number` to clarify that it does not
   work for short-codes or invalid numbers.
   ```

   ### 8.4.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 77affd08f65f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/77affd08f65f);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc changes to update references to ISO country codes to CLDR region codes,
   which are what we actually use. Notice in some of the mapper files the
   country code is still the ISO one, because it&#39;s used as part of a description
   of a language only (e.g. zh-TW vs zh-CN). Edited the language comments there
   since they can be two *or* three letters (c.f. fil for filipino). Also edited
   the comment for leadingDigits at the territory level in the
   `phonemetadata.proto` file.
 - New API methods: `is_possible_number_for_type` and
   `is_possible_number_for_type_with_reason`, along with `supported_types_for_region` and
   `supported_types_for_non_geo_entity`. These allow you to query which types (e.g.
   Mobile) exist for a particular region, and work out if a number is possible
   for that type (this is a simple length check) rather than for the region as a
   whole.
   ```

   ### 8.3.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 46a38545ba01](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/46a38545ba01);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc fix for `geocoder.py` to explain the cases where an empty string might be returned.
   ```

   ### 8.3.2
   ```
   -------------------

Metadata changes only.
   ```

   ### 8.3.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 5507fdbf623f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/5507fdbf623f);
relevant code changes:

 - Making `national_significant_number` more robust in the face of malicious
   input. This now ignores the `number_of_leading_zeros` if they are less than
   zero.
   ```

   ### 8.3.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad297a10ba19](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad297a10ba19);
relevant code changes:

 - Added two new enum values to `ValidationResult` - `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`. Added more documentation to the existing values; see the
   docstrings for when these are going to be used. Note that the API for
   `is_possible_number_with_reason` has not yet been changed to return these values.
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` will be returned for some values which currently
   return `IS_POSSIBLE`, and `INVALID_LENGTH` will be returned for some values which
   currently return `TOO_LONG`.
 - Fix for `is_number_match` to ignore the `number_of_leading_zeros` field when comparing
   numbers unless `italian_leading_zero` is `True`, and to consider default values
   to match the same value when explicitly set for these two fields. This fix
   shouldn&#39;t be needed for anyone correctly creating phone numbers using &quot;parse&quot;
   as recommended.
   ```

   ### 8.2.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 3b16d6b06497](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/3b16d6b06497);
relevant code changes:

 - Exported `normalize_diallable_chars_only`. This method is already public in the C++
   implementation. It has also now been added to the Javascript implementation.
   ```

   ### 8.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit c210dbca4e93](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/c210dbca4e93);
relevant code changes:

  - Introduced new `is_carrier_specific_for_region` API in `shortnumberinfo`.
    This determines whether the provided short code is carrier-specific or
    not when dialed from the given region.
   ```

   ### 8.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1eb06f31e1dd](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1eb06f31e1dd);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing the ability for `.._for_region` methods in `shortnumberinfo.py` to work
    on strings, as well of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated
    for months. Any users of these methods should call `phonenumbers.parse` first to
    create a `PhoneNumber` object, and pass this in.
  - Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This
    is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.
   ```

   ### 7.7.5
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit e905483f87cf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/e905483f87cf);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing all references to `possible_number_pattern` other than in the metadata
    itself.
   ```

   ### 7.7.4
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fedbc7020703](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fedbc7020703);
code changes:

 - GitHub project changes:
    - Changed tag to `vX.Y.Z` from `release-X.Y.Z`; this may affect ports and derived projects.
 - Metadata structure changes in XML file:
    - Mobile and Fixed-Line blocks are no longer assumed to inherit missing data
      from the GeneralDesc, but are treated like every other phone number type.
      This means that for the non-geographical country codes, like +800, the
      example number has been moved from generalDesc to the relevant number types,
      and the code in getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at
      these sub-types for an example number.
      This also means that the &quot;NA&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; blocks present in the metadata to
      indicate that no mobile or fixed-line numbers appear for the entity have been
      removed.
      There should no longer be an `exampleNumber` at the `generalDesc` level, but it
      should be present at every `PhoneNumberDesc` with data.
 - Code changes:
    - Using new `possibleLengthInfo` to decide whether a short number is the right
      length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
      number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
      exclude a number of length 5.
    - Add hash () as a diallable character. Numbers with  in them will no longer
      have formatting applied in `format_n_original_format`, and
      `normalize_diallable_chars_only` now retains the  symbol.
    - `example_number_for_non_geo_entity` has been changed to look at the specific
      number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
      necessary change after the metadata structure change detailed above.
   ```

   ### 7.7.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad0ce0c94501](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad0ce0c94501);
code changes:

 - Fixed `phonemetadata.py` not to merge from a `NumberFormat`&#39;s unset bool
   `national_prefix_optional_when_formatting`.
   ```

   ### 7.7.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 2d0d216f6032](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/2d0d216f6032);
code changes:

 - Stop setting empty `preferred_domestic_carrier_code`, and if we are passed such
   a number then treat the empty field as if unset.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ### 2.1
   ```
   -----------

Released on October 23rd 2015, codename Caesium

- Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
  subclassing mixins and abstract models.
- Allow using a custom MetaData object.
- Add support for binds parameter to session.
   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------
- Added support for multiple databases.
- Expose Flask-SQLAlchemy&#39;s BaseQuery as `db.Query`.

- Improved compatibility with Flask 0.7.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

### Update [phonenumbers](https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers) from **8.9.7** to **8.9.7**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 8.8.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 7e4e754bda09](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/7e4e754bda09);
relevant code changes:

 - Improve parsing logic to be smarter about national-prefix detection &amp;
   stripping based on possible-lengths (`IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`). Enables e.g. adding Iran short-codes starting with &quot;096&quot;
   without the need to hack IR&#39;s national prefix parsing config.
   ```

   ### 8.7.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fb9aa53ecfa3](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fb9aa53ecfa3);
relevant code changes:

 - Documentation fix for `number_type`
   ```

   ### 8.7.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1ad92eb35a44](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1ad92eb35a44);
relevant code changes:

 - New method `supported_calling_codes()` API to return all the calling codes
   that the library considers valid, both for geographical and non-geographical
   entities.
 - Added `is_sms_service_for_region(numobj, region_dialing_from)` API in
   short number info library. An SMS service is where the primary or only
   intended usage is to receive and/or send text messages (SMSs). This includes
   MMS as MMS numbers downgrade to SMS if the other party isn&#39;t MMS-capable. The
   `is_sms_service` metadata is also serialized for the first time.
 - Documentation update for private variables `_VALID_PUNCTUATION` and
   `_SINGLE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`, also renaming the latter from
   `_UNIQUE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`.
   ```

   ### 8.6.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 242a186f1fbf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/242a186f1fbf);
relevant code changes:

 - Removing `leading_zero_possible` from the metadata and all the places it is
   referenced in the build and prod code. Will be removed from the metadata
   proto itself in a subsequent release. This should not affect users of the
   library - the only place it was used was `format_in_original_format`, and only
   initially to try and avoid modifying the input number by removing/adding
   digits inadvertently. Now this is checked at the end of the method anyway.
   However slight formatting differences with this method on invalid numbers
   starting with 0s may be noticed in some countries.
 - Updated the documentation for the `is_number_geographical` API.
 - Small comment improvements for `parse()` method to point users at
   `keep_raw_input` parameter.
 - Added a new enum for `CountryCodeSource` called `UNSPECIFIED`. This is used as a
   default value, and will be returned if someone calls `parse(keep_raw_input=False)` and then
   `.country_code_sourc` on the result. If users want an actual value for this
   then they should call `parse(keep_raw_input=True)` instead; the values that were
   previously returned after calling this method will not change.
 - Deletion of the possible number pattern in the phonemetadata.proto file and
   all generated code. This has not been used for a long time.
   ```

   ### 8.5.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 52cff9d8837f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/52cff9d8837f);
relevant code changes:

 - Add `can_be_internationally_dialled` public API; This was already in JS.
   ```

   ### 8.4.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 9923d9211432](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/9923d9211432);
relevant code changes:

 - Small fix for possible out-of-bounds exception on RFC3966 input where no
   phone context was actually provided.
   ```

   ### 8.4.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 02dbc0921cf5](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/02dbc0921cf5);
relevant code changes:

 - Changing `is_possible_with_reason` to return the enums `INVALID_LENGTH` and
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY`, where these apply. `is_possible_number` continues to
   consider `IS_POSSIBLE` or `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` numbers as possible to dial.
   Announcement: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libphonenumber-discuss/sPhYzdzFCmg/6tYsS1f6DgAJ
 - Doc updates for `region_code_for_number` to clarify that it does not
   work for short-codes or invalid numbers.
   ```

   ### 8.4.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 77affd08f65f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/77affd08f65f);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc changes to update references to ISO country codes to CLDR region codes,
   which are what we actually use. Notice in some of the mapper files the
   country code is still the ISO one, because it&#39;s used as part of a description
   of a language only (e.g. zh-TW vs zh-CN). Edited the language comments there
   since they can be two *or* three letters (c.f. fil for filipino). Also edited
   the comment for leadingDigits at the territory level in the
   `phonemetadata.proto` file.
 - New API methods: `is_possible_number_for_type` and
   `is_possible_number_for_type_with_reason`, along with `supported_types_for_region` and
   `supported_types_for_non_geo_entity`. These allow you to query which types (e.g.
   Mobile) exist for a particular region, and work out if a number is possible
   for that type (this is a simple length check) rather than for the region as a
   whole.
   ```

   ### 8.3.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 46a38545ba01](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/46a38545ba01);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc fix for `geocoder.py` to explain the cases where an empty string might be returned.
   ```

   ### 8.3.2
   ```
   -------------------

Metadata changes only.
   ```

   ### 8.3.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 5507fdbf623f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/5507fdbf623f);
relevant code changes:

 - Making `national_significant_number` more robust in the face of malicious
   input. This now ignores the `number_of_leading_zeros` if they are less than
   zero.
   ```

   ### 8.3.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad297a10ba19](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad297a10ba19);
relevant code changes:

 - Added two new enum values to `ValidationResult` - `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`. Added more documentation to the existing values; see the
   docstrings for when these are going to be used. Note that the API for
   `is_possible_number_with_reason` has not yet been changed to return these values.
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` will be returned for some values which currently
   return `IS_POSSIBLE`, and `INVALID_LENGTH` will be returned for some values which
   currently return `TOO_LONG`.
 - Fix for `is_number_match` to ignore the `number_of_leading_zeros` field when comparing
   numbers unless `italian_leading_zero` is `True`, and to consider default values
   to match the same value when explicitly set for these two fields. This fix
   shouldn&#39;t be needed for anyone correctly creating phone numbers using &quot;parse&quot;
   as recommended.
   ```

   ### 8.2.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 3b16d6b06497](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/3b16d6b06497);
relevant code changes:

 - Exported `normalize_diallable_chars_only`. This method is already public in the C++
   implementation. It has also now been added to the Javascript implementation.
   ```

   ### 8.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit c210dbca4e93](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/c210dbca4e93);
relevant code changes:

  - Introduced new `is_carrier_specific_for_region` API in `shortnumberinfo`.
    This determines whether the provided short code is carrier-specific or
    not when dialed from the given region.
   ```

   ### 8.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1eb06f31e1dd](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1eb06f31e1dd);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing the ability for `.._for_region` methods in `shortnumberinfo.py` to work
    on strings, as well of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated
    for months. Any users of these methods should call `phonenumbers.parse` first to
    create a `PhoneNumber` object, and pass this in.
  - Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This
    is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.
   ```

   ### 7.7.5
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit e905483f87cf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/e905483f87cf);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing all references to `possible_number_pattern` other than in the metadata
    itself.
   ```

   ### 7.7.4
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fedbc7020703](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fedbc7020703);
code changes:

 - GitHub project changes:
    - Changed tag to `vX.Y.Z` from `release-X.Y.Z`; this may affect ports and derived projects.
 - Metadata structure changes in XML file:
    - Mobile and Fixed-Line blocks are no longer assumed to inherit missing data
      from the GeneralDesc, but are treated like every other phone number type.
      This means that for the non-geographical country codes, like +800, the
      example number has been moved from generalDesc to the relevant number types,
      and the code in getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at
      these sub-types for an example number.
      This also means that the &quot;NA&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; blocks present in the metadata to
      indicate that no mobile or fixed-line numbers appear for the entity have been
      removed.
      There should no longer be an `exampleNumber` at the `generalDesc` level, but it
      should be present at every `PhoneNumberDesc` with data.
 - Code changes:
    - Using new `possibleLengthInfo` to decide whether a short number is the right
      length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
      number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
      exclude a number of length 5.
    - Add hash () as a diallable character. Numbers with  in them will no longer
      have formatting applied in `format_n_original_format`, and
      `normalize_diallable_chars_only` now retains the  symbol.
    - `example_number_for_non_geo_entity` has been changed to look at the specific
      number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
      necessary change after the metadata structure change detailed above.
   ```

   ### 7.7.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad0ce0c94501](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad0ce0c94501);
code changes:

 - Fixed `phonemetadata.py` not to merge from a `NumberFormat`&#39;s unset bool
   `national_prefix_optional_when_formatting`.
   ```

   ### 7.7.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 2d0d216f6032](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/2d0d216f6032);
code changes:

 - Stop setting empty `preferred_domestic_carrier_code`, and if we are passed such
   a number then treat the empty field as if unset.
   ```

   ### 7.7.1

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

### Update [phonenumbers](https://pypi.org/project/phonenumbers) from **8.9.7** to **8.9.7**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 8.8.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 7e4e754bda09](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/7e4e754bda09);
relevant code changes:

 - Improve parsing logic to be smarter about national-prefix detection &amp;
   stripping based on possible-lengths (`IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`). Enables e.g. adding Iran short-codes starting with &quot;096&quot;
   without the need to hack IR&#39;s national prefix parsing config.
   ```

   ### 8.7.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fb9aa53ecfa3](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fb9aa53ecfa3);
relevant code changes:

 - Documentation fix for `number_type`
   ```

   ### 8.7.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1ad92eb35a44](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1ad92eb35a44);
relevant code changes:

 - New method `supported_calling_codes()` API to return all the calling codes
   that the library considers valid, both for geographical and non-geographical
   entities.
 - Added `is_sms_service_for_region(numobj, region_dialing_from)` API in
   short number info library. An SMS service is where the primary or only
   intended usage is to receive and/or send text messages (SMSs). This includes
   MMS as MMS numbers downgrade to SMS if the other party isn&#39;t MMS-capable. The
   `is_sms_service` metadata is also serialized for the first time.
 - Documentation update for private variables `_VALID_PUNCTUATION` and
   `_SINGLE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`, also renaming the latter from
   `_UNIQUE_INTERNATIONAL_PREFIX`.
   ```

   ### 8.6.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 242a186f1fbf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/242a186f1fbf);
relevant code changes:

 - Removing `leading_zero_possible` from the metadata and all the places it is
   referenced in the build and prod code. Will be removed from the metadata
   proto itself in a subsequent release. This should not affect users of the
   library - the only place it was used was `format_in_original_format`, and only
   initially to try and avoid modifying the input number by removing/adding
   digits inadvertently. Now this is checked at the end of the method anyway.
   However slight formatting differences with this method on invalid numbers
   starting with 0s may be noticed in some countries.
 - Updated the documentation for the `is_number_geographical` API.
 - Small comment improvements for `parse()` method to point users at
   `keep_raw_input` parameter.
 - Added a new enum for `CountryCodeSource` called `UNSPECIFIED`. This is used as a
   default value, and will be returned if someone calls `parse(keep_raw_input=False)` and then
   `.country_code_sourc` on the result. If users want an actual value for this
   then they should call `parse(keep_raw_input=True)` instead; the values that were
   previously returned after calling this method will not change.
 - Deletion of the possible number pattern in the phonemetadata.proto file and
   all generated code. This has not been used for a long time.
   ```

   ### 8.5.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 52cff9d8837f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/52cff9d8837f);
relevant code changes:

 - Add `can_be_internationally_dialled` public API; This was already in JS.
   ```

   ### 8.4.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 9923d9211432](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/9923d9211432);
relevant code changes:

 - Small fix for possible out-of-bounds exception on RFC3966 input where no
   phone context was actually provided.
   ```

   ### 8.4.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 02dbc0921cf5](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/02dbc0921cf5);
relevant code changes:

 - Changing `is_possible_with_reason` to return the enums `INVALID_LENGTH` and
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY`, where these apply. `is_possible_number` continues to
   consider `IS_POSSIBLE` or `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` numbers as possible to dial.
   Announcement: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/libphonenumber-discuss/sPhYzdzFCmg/6tYsS1f6DgAJ
 - Doc updates for `region_code_for_number` to clarify that it does not
   work for short-codes or invalid numbers.
   ```

   ### 8.4.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 77affd08f65f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/77affd08f65f);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc changes to update references to ISO country codes to CLDR region codes,
   which are what we actually use. Notice in some of the mapper files the
   country code is still the ISO one, because it&#39;s used as part of a description
   of a language only (e.g. zh-TW vs zh-CN). Edited the language comments there
   since they can be two *or* three letters (c.f. fil for filipino). Also edited
   the comment for leadingDigits at the territory level in the
   `phonemetadata.proto` file.
 - New API methods: `is_possible_number_for_type` and
   `is_possible_number_for_type_with_reason`, along with `supported_types_for_region` and
   `supported_types_for_non_geo_entity`. These allow you to query which types (e.g.
   Mobile) exist for a particular region, and work out if a number is possible
   for that type (this is a simple length check) rather than for the region as a
   whole.
   ```

   ### 8.3.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 46a38545ba01](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/46a38545ba01);
relevant code changes:

 - Doc fix for `geocoder.py` to explain the cases where an empty string might be returned.
   ```

   ### 8.3.2
   ```
   -------------------

Metadata changes only.
   ```

   ### 8.3.1
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 5507fdbf623f](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/5507fdbf623f);
relevant code changes:

 - Making `national_significant_number` more robust in the face of malicious
   input. This now ignores the `number_of_leading_zeros` if they are less than
   zero.
   ```

   ### 8.3.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad297a10ba19](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad297a10ba19);
relevant code changes:

 - Added two new enum values to `ValidationResult` - `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` and
   `INVALID_LENGTH`. Added more documentation to the existing values; see the
   docstrings for when these are going to be used. Note that the API for
   `is_possible_number_with_reason` has not yet been changed to return these values.
   `IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY` will be returned for some values which currently
   return `IS_POSSIBLE`, and `INVALID_LENGTH` will be returned for some values which
   currently return `TOO_LONG`.
 - Fix for `is_number_match` to ignore the `number_of_leading_zeros` field when comparing
   numbers unless `italian_leading_zero` is `True`, and to consider default values
   to match the same value when explicitly set for these two fields. This fix
   shouldn&#39;t be needed for anyone correctly creating phone numbers using &quot;parse&quot;
   as recommended.
   ```

   ### 8.2.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 3b16d6b06497](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/3b16d6b06497);
relevant code changes:

 - Exported `normalize_diallable_chars_only`. This method is already public in the C++
   implementation. It has also now been added to the Javascript implementation.
   ```

   ### 8.1.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit c210dbca4e93](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/c210dbca4e93);
relevant code changes:

  - Introduced new `is_carrier_specific_for_region` API in `shortnumberinfo`.
    This determines whether the provided short code is carrier-specific or
    not when dialed from the given region.
   ```

   ### 8.0.0
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 1eb06f31e1dd](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/1eb06f31e1dd);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing the ability for `.._for_region` methods in `shortnumberinfo.py` to work
    on strings, as well of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated
    for months. Any users of these methods should call `phonenumbers.parse` first to
    create a `PhoneNumber` object, and pass this in.
  - Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This
    is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.
   ```

   ### 7.7.5
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit e905483f87cf](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/e905483f87cf);
relevant code changes:

  - Removing all references to `possible_number_pattern` other than in the metadata
    itself.
   ```

   ### 7.7.4
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit fedbc7020703](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/fedbc7020703);
code changes:

 - GitHub project changes:
    - Changed tag to `vX.Y.Z` from `release-X.Y.Z`; this may affect ports and derived projects.
 - Metadata structure changes in XML file:
    - Mobile and Fixed-Line blocks are no longer assumed to inherit missing data
      from the GeneralDesc, but are treated like every other phone number type.
      This means that for the non-geographical country codes, like +800, the
      example number has been moved from generalDesc to the relevant number types,
      and the code in getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at
      these sub-types for an example number.
      This also means that the &quot;NA&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; blocks present in the metadata to
      indicate that no mobile or fixed-line numbers appear for the entity have been
      removed.
      There should no longer be an `exampleNumber` at the `generalDesc` level, but it
      should be present at every `PhoneNumberDesc` with data.
 - Code changes:
    - Using new `possibleLengthInfo` to decide whether a short number is the right
      length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
      number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
      exclude a number of length 5.
    - Add hash () as a diallable character. Numbers with  in them will no longer
      have formatting applied in `format_n_original_format`, and
      `normalize_diallable_chars_only` now retains the  symbol.
    - `example_number_for_non_geo_entity` has been changed to look at the specific
      number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
      necessary change after the metadata structure change detailed above.
   ```

   ### 7.7.3
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit ad0ce0c94501](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/ad0ce0c94501);
code changes:

 - Fixed `phonemetadata.py` not to merge from a `NumberFormat`&#39;s unset bool
   `national_prefix_optional_when_formatting`.
   ```

   ### 7.7.2
   ```
   -------------------

Merge to
[upstream commit 2d0d216f6032](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/2d0d216f6032);
code changes:

 - Stop setting empty `preferred_domestic_carrier_code`, and if we are passed such
   a number then treat the empty field as if unset.
   ```

   ### 7.7.1

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

      against, and is guaranteed to be compatible with.
    - Support for Blueprints (Flask 0.7).
    - Fixed usage for incorrect request context during URL
      generation (thank you, julen).

   ```
   - Really fix the ManageAssets command.
   ```

   ### 0.2.1

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

      (Andy Driver) (fixes 102)
    - Fixed generation of absolute urls using //. (fixes 73)
    - Fixed Flask-Script assets build command. (Frank Tackitt)
   ```

   ### 0.11

      shortcuts (Sean Lynch).
    - Jinja2 filter uses the Flask template environment.
    - Fixed PySscss filter.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new
      extension import system, but using the compatibility module, older
      Flask versions should work fine as well:
      http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensions/
    - Support Python 2.5.
    - Allow customizing the backend of ``ManageAssets`` command.
    - Due to webassets 0.7, the cssrewrite filter now works with Blueprints.

   ```
   - Fixed Blueprint/Module resolving in output path.
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   - Building in 0.6 was very much broken (thanks Oliver Tonnhofer).

      version numbers will now follow along with the version
      of webassets the Flask-Assets release was written
      against, and is guaranteed to be compatible with.
    - Support for Blueprints (Flask 0.7).
    - Fixed usage for incorrect request context during URL
      generation (thank you, julen).
   ```

   ### 0.2.2
   ```
   - Really fix the ManageAssets command.
   ```

### Update [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF) from **0.14.2** to **0.14.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ```

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.1
   ```
   -----------

Released on October 23rd 2015, codename Caesium

- Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
  subclassing mixins and abstract models.
- Allow using a custom MetaData object.
- Add support for binds parameter to session.
   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.
- Dropped 2.5 compatibility.

   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------
- Added support for multiple databases.
- Expose Flask-SQLAlchemy&#39;s BaseQuery as `db.Query`.
- Set default query_class for `db.relation`, `db.relationship`, and

- Improved compatibility with Flask 0.7.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

- applied changes to pass the Flask extension approval process.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

### Update [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF) from **0.14.2** to **0.14.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.

### Update [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF) from **0.14.2** to **0.14.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

### Update [Flask-Assets](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Assets) from **0.12** to **0.12**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.12
   ```
   - Added registration of Flask CLI commands using `flask.commands`
      entrypoint group. (Jiri Kuncar)
    - Added an optional support for FlaskAzureStorage when
      `FLASK_ASSETS_USE_AZURE` is set.  (Alejo Arias)
    - Updated Flask extension imports for compatibility with Flask 0.11.
      (Andy Driver) (fixes 102)
    - Fixed generation of absolute urls using //. (fixes 73)
    - Fixed Flask-Script assets build command. (Frank Tackitt)
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   - Match webassets 0.11.
    - Option to use Flask-CDN (James Elkins).
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.10.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.9.
    flask-assets now support Python 3, and drops support for Python 2.5.

    - Support for Flask-S3 (Erik Taubeneck).
    - Support latest Flask-Script (Chris Hacken).
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.8.

    - Flask-Script&#39;s ``build`` command now has ``--parse-templates`` option.
    - ``Environment`` class now has ``from_yaml`` and ``from_module``
      shortcuts (Sean Lynch).

    - Fixed PySscss filter.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   This release is compatible with webassets 0.7.

    - Now officially requires at least Flask 0.8, so it can use the new
      extension import system, but using the compatibility module, older
      Flask versions should work fine as well:
      http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/extensions/
    - Support Python 2.5.
    - Allow customizing the backend of ``ManageAssets`` command.
    - Due to webassets 0.7, the cssrewrite filter now works with Blueprints.

   ```
   - Fixed Blueprint/Module resolving in output path.
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```

      supported.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   - Support webassets 0.6.
    - Fixed use of wrong Flask app in some cases.
    - Fixed init_app() u…")`

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.

- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.

   ```
   ------------

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

### Update [Flask-WTF](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-WTF) from **0.14.2** to **0.14.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 0.14.2
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where ``FlaskForm`` assumed ``meta`` argument was not ``None`` if it
  was passed. (`278`_)

.. _278: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/278
   ```

   ### 0.14.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2017-01-10

- Fix bug where the file validators would incorrectly identify an empty file as
  valid data. (`276`_, `277`_)

    - ``FileField`` is no longer deprecated. The data is checked during
      processing and only set if it&#39;s a valid file.
    - ``has_file`` *is* deprecated; it&#39;s now equivalent to ``bool(field.data)``.
    - ``FileRequired`` and ``FileAllowed`` work with both the Flask-WTF and
      WTForms ``FileField`` classes.
    - The ``Optional`` validator now works with ``FileField``.

.. _276: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/276
.. _277: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/pull/277
   ```

   ### 0.14
   ```
   ------------

Released 2017-01-06

- Use itsdangerous to sign CSRF tokens and check expiration instead of doing it
  ourselves. (`264`_)

    - All tokens are URL safe, removing the ``url_safe`` parameter from
      ``generate_csrf``. (`206`_)
    - All tokens store a timestamp, which is checked in ``validate_csrf``. The
      ``time_limit`` parameter of ``generate_csrf`` is removed.

- Remove the ``app`` attribute from ``CsrfProtect``, use ``current_app``.
  (`264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect`` protects the ``DELETE`` method by default. (`264`_)
- The same CSRF token is generated for the lifetime of a request. It is exposed
  as ``g.csrf_token`` for use during testing. (`227`_, `264`_)
- ``CsrfProtect.error_handler`` is deprecated. (`264`_)

    - Handlers that return a response work in addition to those that raise an
      error. The behavior was not clear in previous docs.
    - (`200`_, `209`_, `243`_, `252`_)

- Use ``Form.Meta`` instead of deprecated ``SecureForm`` for CSRF (and
  everything else). (`216`_, `271`_)

    - ``csrf_enabled`` parameter is still recognized but deprecated. All other
      attributes and methods from ``SecureForm`` are removed. (`271`_)

- Provide ``WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME`` to configure the name of the CSRF token.
  (`271`_)
- ``validate_csrf`` raises ``wtforms.ValidationError`` with specific messages
  instead of returning ``True`` or ``False``. This breaks anything that was
  calling the method directly. (`239`_, `271`_)

    - CSRF errors are logged as well as raised. (`239`_)

- ``CsrfProtect`` is renamed to ``CSRFProtect``. A deprecation warning is issued
  when using the old name. ``CsrfError`` is renamed to ``CSRFError`` without
  deprecation. (`271`_)
- ``FileField`` is deprecated because it no longer provides functionality over
  the provided validators. Use ``wtforms.FileField`` directly. (`272`_)

   ### 0.13.1
   ```
   --------------

Released 2016/10/6

- Deprecation warning for ``Form`` is shown during ``__init__`` instead of immediately when subclassing. (`262`_)
- Don&#39;t use ``pkg_resources`` to get version, for compatibility with GAE. (`261`_)

.. _`261`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/261
.. _`262`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-wtf/issues/262
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

Released 2016/09/29

- ``Form`` is renamed to ``FlaskForm`` in order to avoid name collision with WTForms&#39;s base class.  Using ``Form`` will show a deprecation warning. (`250`_)
- ``hidden_tag`` no longer wraps the hidden inputs in a hidden div.  This is valid HTML5 and any modern HTML parser will behave correctly. (`217`_, `193`_)
- ``flask_wtf.html5`` is deprecated.  Import directly from ``wtforms.fields.html5``. (`251`_)
- ``is_submitted`` is true for ``PATCH`` and ``DELETE`` in addition to ``POST`` and ``PUT``. (`187`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``token_key`` parameter to specify the key stored in the session. (`206`_)
- ``generate_csrf`` takes a ``url_safe`` parameter to allow the token to be used in URLs. (`206`_)
- ``form.data`` can be accessed multiple times without raising an exception. (`248`_)
- File extension with multiple parts (``.tar.gz``) can be used in the ``FileAllowed`` validator. (`201`_)

      (Andy Driver) (fixes 102)

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2736: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2736
.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

.. _2728: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2728
   ```

   ### 0.12.3
   ```
   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2692`_)
-   Fix a Python warning about imports when using ``python -m flask``.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   ### 0.1

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530

.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328

   ```

   ### 2.1
   ```
   -----------

Released on October 23rd 2015, codename Caesium

- Table names are automatically generated in more cases, including
  subclassing mixins and abstract models.
- Allow using a custom MetaData object.
- Add support for binds parameter to session.
   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.
- Dropped 2.5 compatibility.

   ```
   ------------

- Make relative sqlite paths relative to the application root.
   ```

   ### 0.13
   ```
   ------------

- Fixed an issue with Flask-SQLAlchemy not selecting the correct binds.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------
- Added support for multiple databases.
- Expose Flask-SQLAlchemy&#39;s BaseQuery as `db.Query`.
- Set default query_class for `db.relation`, `db.relationship`, and
  `db.dynamic_loader` to Flask-SQLAlchemy&#39;s BaseQuery.
- Improved compatibility with Flask 0.7.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

### Update [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask) from **1.0.2** to **1.0.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551

.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

  subclassing mixins and abstract models.
- Allow using a custom MetaData object.
- Add support for binds parameter to session.
   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

- Changed how the builtin signals are subscribed to skip non Flask-SQLAlchemy
  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 20th 2013, codename Aurum

- Added Python 3.3 support.
- Dropped 2.5 compatibility.

   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------
- Added support for multiple databases.

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.
- Model.query now always works for applications directly passed to
  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```

  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.
- server listens on 127.0.0.1 by default now to fix issues with chrome.
- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.
- better error reporting on missing secret keys.
- added support for Google Appengine.
   ```

   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

   ```

   ### 2.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on August 29th 2014, codename Bohrium

  sessions.  This will also fix the attribute error about model changes
  not existing.
- Added a way to control how signals for model modifications are tracked.
- Made the ``SignallingSession`` a public interface and added a hook
  for customizing session creation.
- If the ``bind`` parameter is given to the signalling session it will no
  longer cause an error that a parameter is given twice.
- Added working table reflection support.
- Enabled autoflush by default.
- Consider ``SQLALCHEMY_COMMIT_ON_TEARDOWN`` harmful and remove from docs.
   ```

   ### 1.0

   ```
   ------------

- Fixed a bug introduced in 0.10 with alternative table constructors.
   ```

   ```
   ------------

- Added support for signals.
- Table names are now automatically set from the class name unless
  overriden.

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.
- fixed a broken `__repr__`
- `db.Table` is now a factor function that creates table objects.
  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.
   ```

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 1.0.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on May 2nd 2018

-   Fix more backwards compatibility issues with merging slashes between
    a blueprint prefix and route. (`2748`_)
-   Fix error with ``flask routes`` command when there are no routes.
    (`2751`_)

.. _2748: https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2748
.. _2751: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2751
   ```

   ### 1.0.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on April 29th 2018

-   Fix registering partials (with no ``__name__``) as view functions.
    (`2730`_)
-   Don&#39;t treat lists returned from view functions the same as tuples.
    Only tuples are interpreted as response data. (`2736`_)
-   Extra slashes between a blueprint&#39;s ``url_prefix`` and a route URL
    are merged. This fixes some backwards compatibility issues with the
    change in 1.0. (`2731`_, `2742`_)
-   Only trap ``BadRequestKeyError`` errors in debug mode, not all
    ``BadRequest`` errors. This allows ``abort(400)`` to continue
    working as expected. (`2735`_)
-   The ``FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV`` environment variable can be set to ``1``
    to skip automatically loading dotenv files. (`2722`_)

.. _2742: https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2742
   ```

   ### 1.0
   ```
   -----------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   **Python 2.6 and 3.3 are no longer supported.** (`pallets/meta24`_)
-   Bump minimum dependency versions to the latest stable versions:
    Werkzeug &gt;= 0.14, Jinja &gt;= 2.10, itsdangerous &gt;= 0.24, Click &gt;= 5.1.
    (`2586`_)
-   Skip :meth:`app.run &lt;Flask.run&gt;` when a Flask application is run
    from the command line. This avoids some behavior that was confusing
    to debug.
-   Change the default for :data:`JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR` to
    ``False``. :func:`~json.jsonify` returns a compact format by
    default, and an indented format in debug mode. (`2193`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``host_matching``
    argument and sets it on :attr:`~Flask.url_map`. (`1559`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.__init__ &lt;Flask&gt;` accepts the ``static_host`` argument
    and passes it as the ``host`` argument when defining the static
    route. (`1559`_)
-   :func:`send_file` supports Unicode in ``attachment_filename``.
    (`2223`_)
-   Pass ``_scheme`` argument from :func:`url_for` to
    :meth:`~Flask.handle_url_build_error`. (`2017`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule` accepts the
    ``provide_automatic_options`` argument to disable adding the
    ``OPTIONS`` method. (`1489`_)
-   :class:`~views.MethodView` subclasses inherit method handlers from
    base classes. (`1936`_)
-   Errors caused while opening the session at the beginning of the
    request are handled by the app&#39;s error handlers. (`2254`_)
-   Blueprints gained :attr:`~Blueprint.json_encoder` and
    :attr:`~Blueprint.json_decoder` attributes to override the app&#39;s
    encoder and decoder. (`1898`_)
-   :meth:`Flask.make_response` raises ``TypeError`` instead of
    ``ValueError`` for bad response types. The error messages have been
    improved to describe why the type is invalid. (`2256`_)
-   Add ``routes`` CLI command to output routes registered on the
    application. (`2259`_)
-   Show warning when session cookie domain is a bare hostname or an IP
    address, as these may not behave properly in some browsers, such as
    Chrome. (`2282`_)
-   Allow IP address as exact session cookie domain. (`2282`_)
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` is set if it is detected through
    ``SERVER_NAME``. (`2282`_)
-   Auto-detect zero-argument app factory called ``create_app`` or
    ``make_app`` from ``FLASK_APP``. (`2297`_)
-   Factory functions are not required to take a ``script_info``
    parameter to work with the ``flask`` command. If they take a single
    parameter or a parameter named ``script_info``, the
    :class:`~cli.ScriptInfo` object will be passed. (`2319`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can be set to an app factory, with arguments if
    needed, for example ``FLASK_APP=myproject.app:create_app(&#39;dev&#39;)``.
    (`2326`_)
-   ``FLASK_APP`` can point to local packages that are not installed in
    editable mode, although ``pip install -e`` is still preferred.
    (`2414`_)
-   The :class:`~views.View` class attribute
    :attr:`~views.View.provide_automatic_options` is set in
    :meth:`~views.View.as_view`, to be detected by
    :meth:`~Flask.add_url_rule`. (`2316`_)
-   Error handling will try handlers registered for ``blueprint, code``,
    ``app, code``, ``blueprint, exception``, ``app, exception``.
    (`2314`_)
-   ``Cookie`` is added to the response&#39;s ``Vary`` header if the session
    is accessed at all during the request (and not deleted). (`2288`_)
-   :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` accepts ``subdomain`` and
    ``url_scheme`` arguments for use when building the base URL.
    (`1621`_)
-   Set :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` to ``&#39;/&#39;`` by default. This was already
    the implicit default when it was set to ``None``.
-   :data:`TRAP_BAD_REQUEST_ERRORS` is enabled by default in debug mode.
    ``BadRequestKeyError`` has a message with the bad key in debug mode
    instead of the generic bad request message. (`2348`_)
-   Allow registering new tags with
    :class:`~json.tag.TaggedJSONSerializer` to support storing other
    types in the session cookie. (`2352`_)
-   Only open the session if the request has not been pushed onto the
    context stack yet. This allows :func:`~stream_with_context`
    generators to access the same session that the containing view uses.
    (`2354`_)
-   Add ``json`` keyword argument for the test client request methods.
    This will dump the given object as JSON and set the appropriate
    content type. (`2358`_)
-   Extract JSON handling to a mixin applied to both the
    :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` classes. This adds the
    :meth:`~Response.is_json` and :meth:`~Response.get_json` methods to
    the response to make testing JSON response much easier. (`2358`_)
-   Removed error handler caching because it caused unexpected results
    for some exception inheritance hierarchies. Register handlers
    explicitly for each exception if you want to avoid traversing the
    MRO. (`2362`_)
-   Fix incorrect JSON encoding of aware, non-UTC datetimes. (`2374`_)
-   Template auto reloading will honor debug mode even even if
    :attr:`~Flask.jinja_env` was already accessed. (`2373`_)
-   The following old deprecated code was removed. (`2385`_)

    -   ``flask.ext`` - import extensions directly by their name instead
        of through the ``flask.ext`` namespace. For example,
        ``import flask.ext.sqlalchemy`` becomes
        ``import flask_sqlalchemy``.
    -   ``Flask.init_jinja_globals`` - extend
        :meth:`Flask.create_jinja_environment` instead.
    -   ``Flask.error_handlers`` - tracked by
        :attr:`Flask.error_handler_spec`, use :meth:`Flask.errorhandler`
        to register handlers.
    -   ``Flask.request_globals_class`` - use
        :attr:`Flask.app_ctx_globals_class` instead.
    -   ``Flask.static_path`` - use :attr:`Flask.static_url_path`
        instead.
    -   ``Request.module`` - use :attr:`Request.blueprint` instead.

-   The :attr:`Request.json` property is no longer deprecated.
    (`1421`_)
-   Support passing a :class:`~werkzeug.test.EnvironBuilder` or
    ``dict`` to :meth:`test_client.open &lt;werkzeug.test.Client.open&gt;`.
    (`2412`_)
-   The ``flask`` command and :meth:`Flask.run` will load environment
    variables from ``.env`` and ``.flaskenv`` files if python-dotenv is
    installed. (`2416`_)
-   When passing a full URL to the test client, the scheme in the URL is
    used instead of :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME`. (`2430`_)
-   :attr:`Flask.logger` has been simplified. ``LOGGER_NAME`` and
    ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` config was removed. The logger is always
    named ``flask.app``. The level is only set on first access, it
    doesn&#39;t check :attr:`Flask.debug` each time. Only one format is
    used, not different ones depending on :attr:`Flask.debug`. No
    handlers are removed, and a handler is only added if no handlers are
    already configured. (`2436`_)
-   Blueprint view function names may not contain dots. (`2450`_)
-   Fix a ``ValueError`` caused by invalid ``Range`` requests in some
    cases. (`2526`_)
-   The development server uses threads by default. (`2529`_)
-   Loading config files with ``silent=True`` will ignore
    :data:`~errno.ENOTDIR` errors. (`2581`_)
-   Pass ``--cert`` and ``--key`` options to ``flask run`` to run the
    development server over HTTPS. (`2606`_)
-   Added :data:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` to control the ``SameSite``
    attribute on the session cookie. (`2607`_)
-   Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.test_cli_runner` to create a Click runner
    that can invoke Flask CLI commands for testing. (`2636`_)
-   Subdomain matching is disabled by default and setting
    :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicily enable it. It can be enabled
    by passing ``subdomain_matching=True`` to the ``Flask`` constructor.
    (`2635`_)
-   A single trailing slash is stripped from the blueprint
    ``url_prefix`` when it is registered with the app. (`2629`_)
-   :meth:`Request.get_json` doesn&#39;t cache the
    result if parsing fails when ``silent`` is true. (`2651`_)
-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.
    Incoming JSON should be encoded using UTF-8 per :rfc:`8259`, but
    Flask will autodetect UTF-8, -16, or -32. (`2691`_)
-   Added :data:`MAX_COOKIE_SIZE` and :attr:`Response.max_cookie_size`
    to control when Werkzeug warns about large cookies that browsers may
    ignore. (`2693`_)
-   Updated documentation theme to make docs look better in small
    windows. (`2709`_)
-   Rewrote the tutorial docs and example project to take a more
    structured approach to help new users avoid common pitfalls.
    (`2676`_)

   --------------

Released on April 26th 2018

-   :func:`Request.get_json` no longer accepts arbitrary encodings.

   ### 0.12.2
   ```
   --------------

Released on May 16 2017

- Fix a bug in `safe_join` on Windows.
   ```

   ### 0.12.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on March 31st 2017

- Prevent `flask run` from showing a NoAppException when an ImportError occurs
  within the imported application module.
- Fix encoding behavior of ``app.config.from_pyfile`` for Python 3. Fix
  ``2118``.
- Use the ``SERVER_NAME`` config if it is present as default values for
  ``app.run``. ``2109``, ``2152``
- Call `ctx.auto_pop` with the exception object instead of `None`, in the
  event that a `BaseException` such as `KeyboardInterrupt` is raised in a
  request handler.
   ```

   ### 0.12
   ```
   ------------

Released on December 21st 2016, codename Punsch.

- the cli command now responds to `--version`.
- Mimetype guessing and ETag generation for file-like objects in ``send_file``
  has been removed, as per issue ``104``.  See pull request ``1849``.
- Mimetype guessing in ``send_file`` now fails loudly and doesn&#39;t fall back to
  ``application/octet-stream``. See pull request ``1988``.
- Make ``flask.safe_join`` able to join multiple paths like ``os.path.join``
  (pull request ``1730``).
- Revert a behavior change that made the dev server crash instead of returning
  a Internal Server Error (pull request ``2006``).
- Correctly invoke response handlers for both regular request dispatching as
  well as error handlers.
- Disable logger propagation by default for the app logger.
- Add support for range requests in ``send_file``.
- ``app.test_client`` includes preset default environment, which can now be
  directly set, instead of per ``client.get``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.2
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, unreleased

- Fix crash when running under PyPy3, see pull request ``1814``.
   ```

   ### 0.11.1
   ```
   --------------

Bugfix release, released on June 7th 2016.

- Fixed a bug that prevented ``FLASK_APP=foobar/__init__.py`` from working. See
  pull request ``1872``.
   ```

   ### 0.11
   ```
   ------------

Released on May 29th 2016, codename Absinthe.

- Added support to serializing top-level arrays to :func:`flask.jsonify`. This
  introduces a security risk in ancient browsers. See
  :ref:`json-security` for details.
- Added before_render_template signal.
- Added `**kwargs` to :meth:`flask.Test.test_client` to support passing
  additional keyword arguments to the constructor of
  :attr:`flask.Flask.test_client_class`.
- Added ``SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST`` config key that controls the
  set-cookie behavior.  If set to ``True`` a permanent session will be
  refreshed each request and get their lifetime extended, if set to
  ``False`` it will only be modified if the session actually modifies.
  Non permanent sessions are not affected by this and will always
  expire if the browser window closes.
- Made Flask support custom JSON mimetypes for incoming data.
- Added support for returning tuples in the form ``(response, headers)``
  from a view function.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_json`.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.config_class`.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.get_namespace`.
- Templates are no longer automatically reloaded outside of debug mode. This
  can be configured with the new ``TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD`` config key.
- Added a workaround for a limitation in Python 3.3&#39;s namespace loader.
- Added support for explicit root paths when using Python 3.3&#39;s namespace
  packages.
- Added :command:`flask` and the ``flask.cli`` module to start the local
  debug server through the click CLI system.  This is recommended over the old
  ``flask.run()`` method as it works faster and more reliable due to a
  different design and also replaces ``Flask-Script``.
- Error handlers that match specific classes are now checked first,
  thereby allowing catching exceptions that are subclasses of HTTP
  exceptions (in ``werkzeug.exceptions``).  This makes it possible
  for an extension author to create exceptions that will by default
  result in the HTTP error of their choosing, but may be caught with
  a custom error handler if desired.
- Added :meth:`flask.Config.from_mapping`.
- Flask will now log by default even if debug is disabled.  The log format is
  now hardcoded but the default log handling can be disabled through the
  ``LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY`` configuration key.
- Removed deprecated module functionality.
- Added the ``EXPLAIN_TEMPLATE_LOADING`` config flag which when enabled will
  instruct Flask to explain how it locates templates.  This should help
  users debug when the wrong templates are loaded.
- Enforce blueprint handling in the order they were registered for template
  loading.
- Ported test suite to py.test.
- Deprecated ``request.json`` in favour of ``request.get_json()``.
- Add &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;compressed&quot; separators definitions in jsonify() method.
  Reduces JSON response size when JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR=False by removing
  unnecessary white space included by default after separators.
- JSON responses are now terminated with a newline character, because it is a
  convention that UNIX text files end with a newline and some clients don&#39;t
  deal well when this newline is missing. See
  https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1262 -- this came up originally as a
  part of https://github.com/kennethreitz/httpbin/issues/168
- The automatically provided ``OPTIONS`` method is now correctly disabled if
  the user registered an overriding rule with the lowercase-version
  ``options`` (issue ``1288``).
- ``flask.json.jsonify`` now supports the ``datetime.date`` type (pull request
  ``1326``).
- Don&#39;t leak exception info of already catched exceptions to context teardown
  handlers (pull request ``1393``).
- Allow custom Jinja environment subclasses (pull request ``1422``).
- Updated extension dev guidelines.

- ``flask.g`` now has ``pop()`` and ``setdefault`` methods.
- Turn on autoescape for ``flask.templating.render_template_string`` by default
  (pull request ``1515``).
- ``flask.ext`` is now deprecated (pull request ``1484``).
- ``send_from_directory`` now raises BadRequest if the filename is invalid on
  the server OS (pull request ``1763``).
- Added the ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE`` configuration variable (pull request ``1728``).
- Exceptions during teardown handling will no longer leave bad application
  contexts lingering around.
   ```

   ### 0.10.2
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, release date to be announced)

- Fixed broken `test_appcontext_signals()` test case.
- Raise an :exc:`AttributeError` in :func:`flask.helpers.find_package` with a
  useful message explaining why it is raised when a PEP 302 import hook is used
  without an `is_package()` method.
- Fixed an issue causing exceptions raised before entering a request or app
  context to be passed to teardown handlers.
- Fixed an issue with query parameters getting removed from requests in
  the test client when absolute URLs were requested.
- Made `before_first_request` into a decorator as intended.
- Fixed an etags bug when sending a file streams with a name.
- Fixed `send_from_directory` not expanding to the application root path
  correctly.
- Changed logic of before first request handlers to flip the flag after
  invoking.  This will allow some uses that are potentially dangerous but
  should probably be permitted.
- Fixed Python 3 bug when a handler from `app.url_build_error_handlers`
  reraises the `BuildError`.
   ```

   ### 0.10.1
   ```
   --------------

(bugfix release, released on June 14th 2013)

- Fixed an issue where ``|tojson`` was not quoting single quotes which
  made the filter not work properly in HTML attributes.  Now it&#39;s
  possible to use that filter in single quoted attributes.  This should
  make using that filter with angular.js easier.
- Added support for byte strings back to the session system.  This broke
  compatibility with the common case of people putting binary data for
  token verification into the session.
- Fixed an issue where registering the same method twice for the same endpoint
  would trigger an exception incorrectly.
   ```

   ### 0.10
   ```
   ------------

Released on June 13th 2013, codename Limoncello.

- Changed default cookie serialization format from pickle to JSON to
  limit the impact an attacker can do if the secret key leaks.  See
  :ref:`upgrading-to-010` for more information.
- Added ``template_test`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Added ``template_global`` methods in addition to the already existing
  ``template_filter`` method family.
- Set the content-length header for x-sendfile.
- ``tojson`` filter now does not escape script blocks in HTML5 parsers.
- ``tojson`` used in templates is now safe by default due.  This was
  allowed due to the different escaping behavior.
- Flask will now raise an error if you attempt to register a new function
  on an already used endpoint.
- Added wrapper module around simplejson and added default serialization
  of datetime objects.  This allows much easier customization of how
  JSON is handled by Flask or any Flask extension.
- Removed deprecated internal ``flask.session`` module alias.  Use
  ``flask.sessions`` instead to get the session module.  This is not to
  be confused with ``flask.session`` the session proxy.
- Templates can now be rendered without request context.  The behavior is
  slightly different as the ``request``, ``session`` and ``g`` objects
  will not be available and blueprint&#39;s context processors are not
  called.
- The config object is now available to the template as a real global and
  not through a context processor which makes it available even in imported
  templates by default.
- Added an option to generate non-ascii encoded JSON which should result
  in less bytes being transmitted over the network.  It&#39;s disabled by
  default to not cause confusion with existing libraries that might expect
  ``flask.json.dumps`` to return bytestrings by default.
- ``flask.g`` is now stored on the app context instead of the request
  context.
- ``flask.g`` now gained a ``get()`` method for not erroring out on non
  existing items.
- ``flask.g`` now can be used with the ``in`` operator to see what&#39;s defined
  and it now is iterable and will yield all attributes stored.
- ``flask.Flask.request_globals_class`` got renamed to
  ``flask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class`` which is a better name to what it
  does since 0.10.
- `request`, `session` and `g` are now also added as proxies to the template
  context which makes them available in imported templates.  One has to be
  very careful with those though because usage outside of macros might
  cause caching.
- Flask will no longer invoke the wrong error handlers if a proxy
  exception is passed through.
- Added a workaround for chrome&#39;s cookies in localhost not working
  as intended with domain names.
- Changed logic for picking defaults for cookie values from sessions
  to work better with Google Chrome.
- Added `message_flashed` signal that simplifies flashing testing.
- Added support for copying of request contexts for better working with
  greenlets.
- Removed custom JSON HTTP exception subclasses.  If you were relying on them
  you can reintroduce them again yourself trivially.  Using them however is
  strongly discouraged as the interface was flawed.
- Python requirements changed: requiring Python 2.6 or 2.7 now to prepare
  for Python 3.3 port.
- Changed how the teardown system is informed about exceptions.  This is now
  more reliable in case something handles an exception halfway through
  the error handling process.
- Request context preservation in debug mode now keeps the exception
  information around which means that teardown handlers are able to
  distinguish error from success cases.
- Added the ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` configuration variable.
- Flask now orders JSON keys by default to not trash HTTP caches due to
  different hash seeds between different workers.
- Added `appcontext_pushed` and `appcontext_popped` signals.
- The builtin run method now takes the ``SERVER_NAME`` into account when
  picking the default port to run on.
- Added `flask.request.get_json()` as a replacement for the old
  `flask.request.json` property.
   ```

   ### 0.9
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 1st 2012, codename Campari.

- The :func:`flask.Request.on_json_loading_failed` now returns a JSON formatted
  response by default.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can generate anchors to the
  generated links.
- The :func:`flask.url_for` function now can also explicitly generate
  URL rules specific to a given HTTP method.
- Logger now only returns the debug log setting if it was not set
  explicitly.
- Unregister a circular dependency between the WSGI environment and
  the request object when shutting down the request.  This means that
  environ ``werkzeug.request`` will be ``None`` after the response was
  returned to the WSGI server but has the advantage that the garbage
  collector is not needed on CPython to tear down the request unless
  the user created circular dependencies themselves.
- Session is now stored after callbacks so that if the session payload
  is stored in the session you can still modify it in an after
  request callback.
- The :class:`flask.Flask` class will avoid importing the provided import name
  if it can (the required first parameter), to benefit tools which build Flask
  instances programmatically.  The Flask class will fall back to using import
  on systems with custom module hooks, e.g. Google App Engine, or when the
  import name is inside a zip archive (usually a .egg) prior to Python 2.7.
- Blueprints now have a decorator to add custom template filters application
  wide, :meth:`flask.Blueprint.app_template_filter`.
- The Flask and Blueprint classes now have a non-decorator method for adding
  custom template filters application wide,
  :meth:`flask.Flask.add_template_filter` and
  :meth:`flask.Blueprint.add_app_template_filter`.
- The :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` function now allows rendering flashed
  message categories in separate blocks, through a ``category_filter``
  argument.
- The :meth:`flask.Flask.run` method now accepts ``None`` for `host` and `port`
  arguments, using default values when ``None``.  This allows for calling run
  using configuration values, e.g. ``app.run(app.config.get(&#39;MYHOST&#39;),
  app.config.get(&#39;MYPORT&#39;))``, with proper behavior whether or not a config
  file is provided.
- The :meth:`flask.render_template` method now accepts a either an iterable of
  template names or a single template name.  Previously, it only accepted a
  single template name.  On an iterable, the first template found is rendered.
- Added :meth:`flask.Flask.app_context` which works very similar to the
  request context but only provides access to the current application.  This
  also adds support for URL generation without an active request context.
- View functions can now return a tuple with the first instance being an
  instance of :class:`flask.Response`.  This allows for returning
  ``jsonify(error=&quot;error msg&quot;), 400`` from a view function.
- :class:`~flask.Flask` and :class:`~flask.Blueprint` now provide a
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.get_send_file_max_age` hook for subclasses to override
  behavior of serving static files from Flask when using
  :meth:`flask.Flask.send_static_file` (used for the default static file
  handler) and :func:`~flask.helpers.send_file`.  This hook is provided a
  filename, which for example allows changing cache controls by file extension.
  The default max-age for `send_file` and static files can be configured
  through a new ``SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT`` configuration variable, which is
  used in the default `get_send_file_max_age` implementation.
- Fixed an assumption in sessions implementation which could break message
  flashing on sessions implementations which use external storage.
- Changed the behavior of tuple return values from functions.  They are no
  longer arguments to the response object, they now have a defined meaning.
- Added :attr:`flask.Flask.request_globals_class` to allow a specific class to
  be used on creation of the :data:`~flask.g` instance of each request.
- Added `required_methods` attribute to view functions to force-add methods
  on registration.
- Added :func:`flask.after_this_request`.
- Added :func:`flask.stream_with_context` and the ability to push contexts
  multiple times without producing unexpected behavior.
   ```

   ### 0.8.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 1st 2012

- Fixed an issue with the undocumented `flask.session` module to not
  work properly on Python 2.5.  It should not be used but did cause
  some problems for package managers.
   ```

   ### 0.8
   ```
   -----------

Released on September 29th 2011, codename Rakija

- Refactored session support into a session interface so that
  the implementation of the sessions can be changed without
  having to override the Flask class.
- Empty session cookies are now deleted properly automatically.
- View functions can now opt out of getting the automatic
  OPTIONS implementation.
- HTTP exceptions and Bad Request errors can now be trapped so that they
  show up normally in the traceback.
- Flask in debug mode is now detecting some common problems and tries to
  warn you about them.
- Flask in debug mode will now complain with an assertion error if a view
  was attached after the first request was handled.  This gives earlier
  feedback when users forget to import view code ahead of time.
- Added the ability to register callbacks that are only triggered once at
  the beginning of the first request. (:meth:`Flask.before_first_request`)
- Malformed JSON data will now trigger a bad request HTTP exception instead
  of a value error which usually would result in a 500 internal server
  error if not handled.  This is a backwards incompatible change.
- Applications now not only have a root path where the resources and modules
  are located but also an instance path which is the designated place to
  drop files that are modified at runtime (uploads etc.).  Also this is
  conceptually only instance depending and outside version control so it&#39;s
  the perfect place to put configuration files etc.  For more information
  see :ref:`instance-folders`.
- Added the ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration variable.
- Implemented :meth:`~flask.testing.TestClient.session_transaction` to
  easily modify sessions from the test environment.
- Refactored test client internally.  The ``APPLICATION_ROOT`` configuration
  variable as well as ``SERVER_NAME`` are now properly used by the test client
  as defaults.
- Added :attr:`flask.views.View.decorators` to support simpler decorating of
  pluggable (class-based) views.
- Fixed an issue where the test client if used with the &quot;with&quot; statement did not
  trigger the execution of the teardown handlers.
- Added finer control over the session cookie parameters.
- HEAD requests to a method view now automatically dispatch to the `get`
  method if no handler was implemented.
- Implemented the virtual :mod:`flask.ext` package to import extensions from.
- The context preservation on exceptions is now an integral component of
  Flask itself and no longer of the test client.  This cleaned up some
  internal logic and lowers the odds of runaway request contexts in unittests.
   ```

   ### 0.7.3
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, release date to be decided

- Fixed the Jinja2 environment&#39;s list_templates method not returning the
  correct names when blueprints or modules were involved.
   ```

   ### 0.7.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on July 6th 2011

- Fixed an issue with URL processors not properly working on
  blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on June 29th 2011

- Added missing future import that broke 2.5 compatibility.
- Fixed an infinite redirect issue with blueprints.
   ```

   ### 0.7
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 28th 2011, codename Grappa

- Added :meth:`~flask.Flask.make_default_options_response`
  which can be used by subclasses to alter the default
  behavior for ``OPTIONS`` responses.
- Unbound locals now raise a proper :exc:`RuntimeError` instead
  of an :exc:`AttributeError`.
- Mimetype guessing and etag support based on file objects is now
  deprecated for :func:`flask.send_file` because it was unreliable.
  Pass filenames instead or attach your own etags and provide a
  proper mimetype by hand.
- Static file handling for modules now requires the name of the
  static folder to be supplied explicitly.  The previous autodetection
  was not reliable and caused issues on Google&#39;s App Engine.  Until
  1.0 the old behavior will continue to work but issue dependency
  warnings.
- fixed a problem for Flask to run on jython.
- added a ``PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS`` configuration variable that can be
  used to flip the setting of exception propagation which previously
  was linked to ``DEBUG`` alone and is now linked to either ``DEBUG`` or
  ``TESTING``.
- Flask no longer internally depends on rules being added through the
  `add_url_rule` function and can now also accept regular werkzeug
  rules added to the url map.
- Added an `endpoint` method to the flask application object which
  allows one to register a callback to an arbitrary endpoint with
  a decorator.
- Use Last-Modified for static file sending instead of Date which
  was incorrectly introduced in 0.6.
- Added `create_jinja_loader` to override the loader creation process.
- Implemented a silent flag for `config.from_pyfile`.
- Added `teardown_request` decorator, for functions that should run at the end
  of a request regardless of whether an exception occurred.  Also the behavior
  for `after_request` was changed.  It&#39;s now no longer executed when an exception
  is raised.  See :ref:`upgrading-to-new-teardown-handling`
- Implemented :func:`flask.has_request_context`
- Deprecated `init_jinja_globals`.  Override the
  :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_jinja_environment` method instead to
  achieve the same functionality.
- Added :func:`flask.safe_join`
- The automatic JSON request data unpacking now looks at the charset
  mimetype parameter.
- Don&#39;t modify the session on :func:`flask.get_flashed_messages` if there
  are no messages in the session.
- `before_request` handlers are now able to abort requests with errors.
- it is not possible to define user exception handlers.  That way you can
  provide custom error messages from a central hub for certain errors that
  might occur during request processing (for instance database connection
  errors, timeouts from remote resources etc.).
- Blueprints can provide blueprint specific error handlers.
- Implemented generic :ref:`views` (class-based views).
   ```

   ### 0.6.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on December 31st 2010

- Fixed an issue where the default ``OPTIONS`` response was
  not exposing all valid methods in the ``Allow`` header.
- Jinja2 template loading syntax now allows &quot;./&quot; in front of
  a template load path.  Previously this caused issues with
  module setups.
- Fixed an issue where the subdomain setting for modules was
  ignored for the static folder.
- Fixed a security problem that allowed clients to download arbitrary files
  if the host server was a windows based operating system and the client
  uses backslashes to escape the directory the files where exposed from.
   ```

   ### 0.6
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 27th 2010, codename Whisky

- after request functions are now called in reverse order of
  registration.
- OPTIONS is now automatically implemented by Flask unless the
  application explicitly adds &#39;OPTIONS&#39; as method to the URL rule.
  In this case no automatic OPTIONS handling kicks in.
- static rules are now even in place if there is no static folder
  for the module.  This was implemented to aid GAE which will
  remove the static folder if it&#39;s part of a mapping in the .yml
  file.
- the :attr:`~flask.Flask.config` is now available in the templates
  as `config`.
- context processors will no longer override values passed directly
  to the render function.
- added the ability to limit the incoming request data with the
  new ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`` configuration value.
- the endpoint for the :meth:`flask.Module.add_url_rule` method
  is now optional to be consistent with the function of the
  same name on the application object.
- added a :func:`flask.make_response` function that simplifies
  creating response object instances in views.
- added signalling support based on blinker.  This feature is currently
  optional and supposed to be used by extensions and applications.  If
  you want to use it, make sure to have `blinker`_ installed.
- refactored the way URL adapters are created.  This process is now
  fully customizable with the :meth:`~flask.Flask.create_url_adapter`
  method.
- modules can now register for a subdomain instead of just an URL
  prefix.  This makes it possible to bind a whole module to a
  configurable subdomain.

.. _blinker: https://pypi.org/project/blinker/
   ```

   ### 0.5.2
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 15th 2010

- fixed another issue with loading templates from directories when
  modules were used.
   ```

   ### 0.5.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix Release, released on July 6th 2010

- fixes an issue with template loading from directories when modules
  where used.
   ```

   ### 0.5
   ```
   -----------

Released on July 6th 2010, codename Calvados

- fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
  specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with
  the ``SERVER_NAME`` config key.  This key is now also used to set
  the session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
- autoescaping is no longer active for all templates.  Instead it
  is only active for ``.html``, ``.htm``, ``.xml`` and ``.xhtml``.
  Inside templates this behavior can be changed with the
  ``autoescape`` tag.
- refactored Flask internally.  It now consists of more than a
  single file.
- :func:`flask.send_file` now emits etags and has the ability to
  do conditional responses builtin.
- (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
  rarely used feature and led to some confusing behavior.
- added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
- removed support for `create_jinja_loader` which is no longer used
  in 0.5 due to the improved module support.
- added a helper function to expose files from any directory.
   ```

   ### 0.4
   ```
   -----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added ``TESTING`` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to ``DEBUG`` mode now if debug is enabled.
   ```

   ### 0.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Bugfix release, released on May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`
- removed some unused code from flask
- release does no longer include development leftover files (.git
  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)
   ```

   ### 0.3
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will
  log request handling exceptions to that logger when not in debug
  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.
- the request context is now available within the with statement making
  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
- added support for configurations.
   ```

   ### 0.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on May 12th 2010, codename Jägermeister

- various bugfixes
- integrated JSON support
- added :func:`~flask.get_template_attribute` helper function.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule` can now also register a
  view function.
- refactored internal request dispatching.

- added external URL support.
- added support for :func:`~flask.send_file`
- module support and internal request handling refactoring
  to better support pluggable applications.
- sessions can be set to be permanent now on a per-session basis.

### Update [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy) from **2.3.2** to **2.3.2**.

<details>
  <summary>Changelog</summary>

   ### 2.3.2
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 11, 2017

- Don&#39;t mask the parent table for single-table inheritance models. (`561`_)

.. _561: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/561
   ```

   ### 2.3.1
   ```
   -------------

Released on October 5, 2017

- If a model has a table name that matches an existing table in the metadata,
  use that table. Fixes a regression where reflected tables were not picked up
  by models. (`551`_)
- Raise the correct error when a model has a table name but no primary key.
  (`556`_)
- Fix ``repr`` on models that don&#39;t have an identity because they have not been
  flushed yet. (`555`_)
- Allow specifying a ``max_per_page`` limit for pagination, to avoid users
  specifying high values in the request args. (`542`_)
- For ``paginate`` with ``error_out=False``, the minimum value for ``page`` is
  1 and ``per_page`` is 0. (`558`_)

.. _542: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/542
.. _551: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/551
.. _555: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/555
.. _556: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/556
.. _558: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/558
   ```

   ### 2.3.0
   ```
   -------------

Released on September 28, 2017

- Multiple bugs with ``__tablename__`` generation are fixed. Names will be
  generated for models that define a primary key, but not for single-table
  inheritance subclasses. Names will not override a ``declared_attr``.
  ``PrimaryKeyConstraint`` is detected. (`541`_)
- Passing an existing ``declarative_base()`` as ``model_class`` to
  ``SQLAlchemy.__init__`` will use this as the base class instead of creating
  one. This allows customizing the metaclass used to construct the base.
  (`546`_)
- The undocumented ``DeclarativeMeta`` internals that the extension uses for
  binds and table name generation have been refactored to work as mixins.
  Documentation is added about how to create a custom metaclass that does not
  do table name generation. (`546`_)
- Model and metaclass code has been moved to a new ``models`` module.
  ``_BoundDeclarativeMeta`` is renamed to ``DefaultMeta``; the old name will be
  removed in 3.0. (`546`_)
- Models have a default ``repr`` that shows the model name and primary key.
  (`530`_)
- Fixed a bug where using ``init_app`` would cause connectors to always use the
  ``current_app`` rather than the app they were created for. This caused issues
  when multiple apps were registered with the extension. (`547`_)

.. _530: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/530
.. _541: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/541
.. _546: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/546
.. _547: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/547
   ```

   ### 2.2
   ```
   -----------

Released on February 27, 2017, codename Dubnium

- Minimum SQLAlchemy version is 0.8 due to use of ``sqlalchemy.inspect``.
- Added support for custom ``query_class`` and ``model_class`` as args
  to the ``SQLAlchemy`` constructor. (`328`_)
- Allow listening to SQLAlchemy events on ``db.session``. (`364`_)
- Allow ``__bind_key__`` on abstract models. (`373`_)
- Allow ``SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`` to be a string. (`409`_)
- Warn when ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is not set. (`443`_)
- Don&#39;t let pagination generate invalid page numbers. (`460`_)
- Drop support of Flask &lt; 0.10. This means the db session is always tied to
  the app context and its teardown event. (`461`_)
- Tablename generation logic no longer accesses class properties unless they
  are ``declared_attr``. (`467`_)

.. _328: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/328
.. _364: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/364
.. _373: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/373
.. _409: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/409
.. _443: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/443
.. _460: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/460
.. _461: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/461
.. _467: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask-sqlalchemy/pull/467
   ```

   ```
   ------------

  the SQLAlchemy constructor.  Furthermore the property now raises
  an RuntimeError instead of being None.
- added session options to constructor.

  This makes it possible to omit the metadata.

This release includes an important security fix for JSON and a minor backport for CLI support in PyCharm. It is provided for projects that cannot update to Flask 1.0 immediately. See the [1.0 announcement](/pallets/flask/blob/flask-1-0-released) and update to it instead if possible.

## JSON Security Fix

Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.

Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.

## Upgrade

Upgrade from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip. Use a version identifier if you want to stay at 0.12:

```
pip install -U 'Flask~=0.12.3'

```

Or upgrade to 1.0:

```
pip install -U Flask

```
