Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GitHub Plugin had a form validation method that did not properly check user permissions. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credential IDs which can be obtained through another method in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing permission checks:** The form validation method lacked proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the vulnerability.
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Credential Leakage:** By connecting to an attacker-controlled URL using attacker-specified credential IDs, attackers could capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Capture:** An attacker could steal sensitive credentials stored within the Jenkins instance.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can potentially lead to unauthorized access to resources or systems associated with the stolen credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely over the network.
- **CSRF:** A malicious website or email could trick a logged-in Jenkins user into triggering the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Jenkins Overall/Read Access:** The attacker must have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- **Knowledge of Jenkins Credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of existing credential IDs in order to specify them in the malicious request.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Endpoint:** The attacker needs a server under their control to capture the credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability, along with others, was addressed in the Jenkins Security Advisory 2018-06-04.
- The fix involves implementing proper permission checks requiring POST requests and appropriate user permissions for the vulnerable form validation method.
- The affected versions of the GitHub plugin are up to and including 1.29.0.
- The recommended fix is to update to version 1.29.1 or later.
