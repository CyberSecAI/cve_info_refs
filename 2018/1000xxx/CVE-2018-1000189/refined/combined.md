# AbsInt Astrée

How to install

* [Documentation](/absint-astree/)
* [Releases](/absint-astree/releases/)
* [Issues](/absint-astree/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/absint-astree/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/absint-astree/healthscore/)

# AbsInt Astrée

Integration of AbsInt’s static code analyzer [Astrée](https://www.absint.com/astree) into the Jenkins continuous integration system.

# Features

* Configure an analyzer run as a Jenkins build step
* Launch an Astrée analysis as a newly created analysis revision
* Automatically mark a build step as erroneous depending on the categories of findings
* Generate analysis reports directly in your Jenkins workspace
* Access analysis results via the Jenkins web interface

# Function

The AbsInt Astrée plugin for Jenkins performs the following functions:

* It transparently invokes Astrée during your build.
* It can fail the build for different analysis outcomes (only on errors, also on alarms or also on data-flow anomalies reported).

# Getting started

* Install the plugin using the Plugin Manager, then restart Jenkins.
* Go to the global configuration page (Manage Jenkins > Configure System).
* Find the Astrée Configuration Section and specify the location of the AbsInt Launcher (alauncher) program and the Astrée server (hostname and port).

# Project Setup and Project Configuration Settings

* Create a Jenkins project, by creating it from scratch or by copying an existing project.
* Under Configure, add a build step ‘Astrée Analysis Run.’

## Basic Settings

Specify an analysis setup by providing an absolute path to the DAX file containing the analysis specification and configuration. You may also provide the ID of an existing, preconfigured analysis on the Astrée server that serves as a revisioning base for the analyses of the current Jenkins project. The analysis, as configured via the supported DAX file, of a build is imported as a new revision into the project with this ID on the server, if such a project exists. Furthermore, specify on which analysis outcome, Astrée may fail a build.

## Options

You may furthermore configure your analysis run to:

* Delete the project from the server after the analysis run
* Generate text report containing the detailed preprocessing output in project workspace

Now start your build. After the build has completed,

* a summary with the analysis results will be printed to the console output in Jenkins and
* analysis reports can be found at the location specified in the Astrée build step configuration or in the Jenkins project workspace in case no other location has been configured.

# Troubleshooting

When you encounter problems while using the plugin, please provide the following information:

* The error message from the Console Output.
* The Jenkins server log file (the location is dependent on the container you use)
* The content of ‘Manage Jenkins > System Information’ (*Jenkins root*/systemInfo)
* The configuration file for the job (Jenkins root/jobs/*job name*/config.xml)
* The global configuration file for Jenkins (Jenkins root/config.xml)
* The Astrée analysis report and XML report files (if available).
* In case of problems while saving the job configuration, a screenshot before submitting, the error message afterwards and the browser you are using.

# Upgrading

When upgrading, make sure that all jobs using the Astrée plugin are finished and not running during upgrade. For best results, restart your Jenkins after upgrade.

## Descriptions

### Server-side request forgery vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-810
/
CVE-2018-1000182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Various form validation methods in Git Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

### Server-side request forgery vulnerability in GitHub Plugin

**SECURITY-799
/
CVE-2018-1000184**
