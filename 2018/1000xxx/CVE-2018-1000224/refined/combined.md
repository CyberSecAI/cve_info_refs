## Description

[![@Faless](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687918?v=4&size=48)](/Faless)[Faless](https://github.com/Faless)opened [on Jul 29, 2018](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20558#issue-345493786)
## THIS ISSUE IS ALREADY FIXED. IT IS TEMPORARILY LEFT OPEN TO RAISE AWARENESS

# [Godot 2.1.5](https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-2-1-5)

# [Godot 3.0.6](https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-0-6)

**Godot version:** Any version of Godot since I could trace (2014, when it was open sourced)

**OS/device including version:** Any

**Issue description:**

Few weeks ago, I noticed by chance that passing a specific array of bytes to [`bytes2var()`](docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/classes/class_%40gdscript.html#class-gdscript-bytes2var) crashed the engine.

(in 3.0 `bytes2var(PoolByteArray([20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255]))`).

After further investigations I realised that the (de)serialization code hadn't seen love in a while, so I went for a full audit and found out there were actually a few more issues.

The main issues where:

* **Crash due to unbound allocation**: Array types sometimes didn't have the right size check (due to incorrenct signed/unsigned comparison), causing the engine to try to allocate huge ammount of memory and being terminated by the OS.
* **Read buffer overflow**: Some types had incorrect size checks potentially causing buffer overflow during reading.
* **Leak of memory content**: Some strings padding where not correctly zeroized, potentially causing freed-but-not-cleared internal memory disclosure over network (although be reassured by the fact that crypto libs like OpenSSL and mbedTLS does clear their memory when freeing things like private key and so on).

I decided to privately contact few other developers ([@reduz](https://github.com/reduz), [@akien-mga](https://github.com/akien-mga), [@hpvb](https://github.com/hpvb), [@karroffel](https://github.com/karroffel)) and we agreed to embargo this issue while we worked on a fix.

If you are reading this, patches are are already available (so this issue is actually closed), and updated binaries are available for download at the [official Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).

**Steps to reproduce:**

Run a script that executes (3.0):

```
bytes2var(PoolByteArray([20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255]))

```

**Minimal reproduction project:**

Please see this [testing project](https://github.com/Faless/gd-marshalls-tester) I made to perform automatic tests.

**Afterwords**

First, I would like to thank all the devs involved, who helped me a lot during the development of the fix, and stayed online on weekends to do the releases.

In my humble opinion, this incident, along with the history of this engine, clearly shows how source code availability and great communities like this one, can improve software quality with concrete benefits to everyone.

From a security prospective, responsible disclosure is, in my opinion, the best road to security. In this sense, in the coming month we will be working on setting up guidelines and procedures in case anyone discovers a new security issue.

In the meantime, I invite everyone with a passion in security, to try and break our engine, the network code, the serialization process. If you find anything, let us know here on Github or on IRC at #godotengine-devel , we won't sue you, we will actually thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Maintenance release: Godot 2.1.5

By: ![R√É¬©mi Verschelde](/assets/images/authors/akien.webp)
R√É¬©mi Verschelde28 July 2018[Release](/blog/release)

At long last, Godot 2.1.5 is ready and comes packed with new features and bug fixes! It√¢¬Ä¬ôs the result of 11 months of work ([since 2.1.4](/article/maintenance-release-godot-2-1-4)) from many contributors who care about supporting our previous stable branch (the current one and main focus being [Godot 3.0.x](/download)).

[**Download it now**](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.5/) from our repositories if you are still using Godot 2.1.x for some projects. If you use it via the Steam distribution (where both 2.1.x and 3.0.x are included), it has been updated already - please keep in mind that we√¢¬Ä¬ôll eventually stop distributing Godot 2.1.x on Steam (likely when moving to Godot 3.1). **Note:** This release fixes security vulnerabilities in Godot√¢¬Ä¬ôs marshalling code (see the [Godot 3.0.6 announcement](https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-0-6) for details) as well as an OpenSSL security update, so upgrading to this version is *strongly recommended* if you use any networking features.

Note that contrarily to 3.0 which can download the export templates for you automatically, with 2.1 you still need to [download the .tpz file](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.5/Godot_v2.1.5-stable_export_templates.tpz) manually and use it to install templates within the editor.
## Wait, what is 2.1.x again?

Before presenting the highlights of this release, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs clear some frequently asked questions upfront:
#### What is 2.1.5? Isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt the current stable version 3.0.x?

Godot 2.1 (from [August 2016](/article/godot-reaches-2-1-stable)) was our previous major release before Godot 3.0 (from [January 2018](/article/godot-3-0-released)). Just like the current 3.0.x branch, it received maintenance updates with bug fixes and enhancements every few months, though the last to date was 2.1.4 in [August 2017](/article/maintenance-release-godot-2-1-4).

As some users *cannot* use Godot 3.0 or later for a number of reasons, we are still maintaining the 2.1.x branch for a while. Those reasons are typically:

* OpenGL ES 2.0 support needed for mobile games. Godot 3.0 only supports OpenGL ES 3.0 which is problematic on many mobile devices. The upcoming Godot 3.1 will bring back support for OpenGL ES 2.0, so by then the 2.1.x branch will cease to be so important for mobile developers.* Existing projects started in Godot 2.1 might not always be worth porting to 3.0 given the important compatibility breakage.

The latter implies that new 2.1.x releases can be needed for users willing to push their 2.1 games in production, and especially:

* Distribution platforms like Google Play or Apple Store regularly increase their requirements in terms of targeted SDKs, so we need to update our export templates accordingly.* Security vulnerabilities in thirdparty libraries or in Godot√¢¬Ä¬ôs own code need to be addressed in all supported branches.

#### I√¢¬Ä¬ôm using 3.0.x, do I need this new release?

If you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know, you probably don√¢¬Ä¬ôt. The 2.1.5 release is strictly intended for existing users who need it to publish or update their 2.1 games. If you are already using Godot 3.0.x, stick to it as it has hundreds of features that Godot 2.1.5 does not have, since it√¢¬Ä¬ôs based on a 2016 branching of the main development branch.
#### Where are all the cool new features seen on the blog?

Most new features you see [on this blog](/news) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reduzio) are merged in the *master* branch, which is the development branch of our *next* stable branch, i.e. Godot 3.1. So those features are only available in nightly builds, or when compiling from the master branch - they will eventually be made available for all with Godot 3.1 alpha 1, and in a few months 3.1-stable.
## Highlights

With 11 months of work and over 450 commits to the *2.1* branch since 2.1.4, there√¢¬Ä¬ôs a lot to cover! Check the [**detailed changelog**](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.5/Godot_v2.1.5-stable_changelog.txt) for the exhaustive listing.

Here are some of the main highlights of this release, listed by topic/category.
### Platform support

#### Android

* APKs no longer include placeholder permissions that Google Play started complaining about in [May 2018](/article/fixing-godot-games-published-google-play) (same fix as in [Godot 3.0.5](/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-0-5)). [[GH-20082]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/20082)* Minimum SDK raised to 18 (Android 4.3) to allow signing APKs with SHA-256 + RSA. [[GH-18626]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/18626)* Target SDK raised to 27 to fulfill [Google Play requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html) for August 2018. [[GH-18626]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/18626)* Support for ARM64v8, fulfills [Google Play√¢¬Ä¬ôs requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html) for for August 2019. [[GH-18426]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/18426)* Various crash fixes.

#### iOS

* Minimum SDK raised to 9.0, target SDK raised to 11.4 (11.0+ required for new uploads on Apple Store). [[GH-18995]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/18995)

#### Linux

* Multitouch support on X11. [[GH-14346]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/14346)* Generate mouse event from touch as on other platforms. [[GH-17195]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/17195)* Fixes to fullscreen mode on X11. [[GH-16762]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/16762)

#### macOS

* Exporting for macOS from a Mac now generates a .dmg package. [[GH-11476]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/11476)* Implement vsync OS functions for macOS. [[GH-12354]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/12354)

#### Windows

* New WASAPI audio driver with better latency than RtAudio (as in 3.0). [[GH-10942]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10942)

#### Common

* Add hardware cursor acceleration support for all platforms. **Note:** Breaks compatibility with *cursor* methods in `Input`, some scripts might need to be adjusted. [[GH-13437]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/13437)* Add `OS.center_window` to center the window precisely on desktop platforms. [[GH-13930]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/13930)

### Editor tools

* New crash handler to generate backtraces when crashing on all desktop platforms (as in 3.0). [[GH-10124]](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/10124)* Dozens of improvements to the √¢¬Ä¬úGodot 2 to 3 converter√¢¬Ä¬ù tool, which can now convert many more resources than the one in 2.1.4. It even has an option to tentatively convert your scripts and change things like `get_pos()` (2.1) to `get_position()` (3.0) automatically.* Add class members overview in script editor.

# Maintenance release: Godot 3.0.6

By: ![HP van Braam](/assets/images/authors/default_avatar.svg)
HP van Braam29 July 2018[Release](/blog/release)

Godot has had its first public security issue. This has been an√¢¬Ä¬¶ *interesting* experience for our team. The issue in question affects people that try to deserialize untrusted native Godot data. For the most part this only affects people running as a networking server but people serializing savegame data may also be affected. This last case for the most part would allow people to cheat in their local games. For details on the security issue itself please see [this issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20558) for technical details.

The issue was found by our very own [Fabio Alessandrelli](https://github.com/Faless). He also wrote the fixes that are in 3.0.6 and 2.1.5 now. He did an amazing job.

In addition to this important security update this release also adds some bugfixes, some Mono fixes, and we introduce a new download type called √¢¬Ä¬òheadless√¢¬Ä¬ô. We had a variety of users trying to use the √¢¬Ä¬òserver√¢¬Ä¬ô releases to do importing of assets or exporting as part of a CI pipeline. For performance reasons as of 3.0.3 the √¢¬Ä¬òserver√¢¬Ä¬ô release actually no longer had this functionality. To retain the performance improvement for users who use the server release as, well, a server we have now added the √¢¬Ä¬òheadless√¢¬Ä¬ô download. This download has all of the tools included and should work in a CI pipeline.

As usual you can go directly to our [Download](/download) page to download the new release. Itch.io and Steam releases will be updated soon **Please note that for the Mono releases you *must* use Mono 5.12.0 on all platforms.**

Please join me in an *exuberant* standing ovation to our dashingly beautiful contributors and their near impossible dedication to making Godot the best game engine it can be!
## What√¢¬Ä¬ôs new in this release

Here are some of the highlights of this release. See the [full changelog](http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.0.6/Godot_v3.0.6-stable_changelog.txt) for details.

## Known incompatibilities with Godot 3.0.2

None
## Known incompatibilities with Godot 3.0

* If you use the Bullet physics engine and relied on the fact that the calculated effective gravity on KinematicBodies was always √¢¬Ä¬ò0√¢¬Ä¬ô then you will need to fix your code as this is now correctly calculated. See [#15554](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/15554) for details.* Setting the `v` member of a color did not properly set the `s` member. This is now corrected. See [#16916](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/16916) for details.* RichTextLabels did not properly determine the baseline of all fonts. If you relied on the look of the previous implementation please let us know. See [#15711](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/15711) for details.* SpinBoxes didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt calculate their width properly. This is now fixed but could subtly change your GUI layout. See [#16432](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/16432) for details.* OGG streams now correctly signal the end of playback. If you were relying on this not happening please let us know. See [#15910](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/15910) for details.

## Known bugs in Godot 3.0.6

* `Vector3.snapped()` does not work and just returns the original Vector3. Fixing this would have meant breaking ABI between Godot 3.0 and 3.0.2 so this function will remain non-functional.* `move_and_slide()` doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt quite work correctly. An easy workaround is to increase the safe margin to 0.05 (or higher if required). It is not yet clear how to implement the proper fix without impacting users who already implemented this workaround in their projects. See [issue #16459](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/16459) for an explanation.* When exporting to iOS you get an error about missing or corrupt templates if the App Store Team Id or Required Icons are not set even if the templates are installed.* 32Bit Mono builds appear to not function properly with Windows 8.1 64bit.
