Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Black Duck Hub Plugin lacked proper permission checks on methods implementing form validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** Form validation methods within the plugin did not verify the user's permissions before executing.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Form validation methods did not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The lack of permission checks allowed attackers to cause Jenkins to send HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers could leverage the vulnerability to connect to attacker-controlled URLs using attacker-specified credential IDs, allowing them to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Arbitrary HTTP Requests:** Attackers could cause the Jenkins server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack can be performed by users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that bypasses the lack of permission checks, using attacker-specified credential IDs and URLs.
*   Due to the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker could potentially trick an administrator into executing the crafted malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the form validation request and have a way to construct a malicious request (either manually or via a CSRF exploit) and supply their crafted URLs and credential ID.
