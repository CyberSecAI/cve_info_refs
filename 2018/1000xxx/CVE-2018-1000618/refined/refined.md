Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-1000618:

**Summary:**
This pull request addresses a vulnerability related to the `abi_serializer` in EOSIO, which could lead to issues when deserializing transactions with invalid ABI definitions. Specifically, it fixes a potential recursion issue during deserialization and enhances the error handling when invalid ABIs are encountered.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a potential lack of recursion limits in the `abi_serializer` of EOSIO when processing ABI definitions, which could lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unbounded recursion:** The `abi_serializer` was susceptible to unbounded recursion when processing malformed or complex ABIs, which could lead to a stack overflow.
- **Failure to handle invalid ABI:** The system did not handle cases of invalid ABI in transactions properly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** An attacker could potentially craft transactions with specially crafted ABI definitions that trigger the recursion issue, causing the system to crash due to a stack overflow. This would lead to a denial of service.
- **Failure to process transactions:** Invalid ABI in a transaction would lead to processing failure.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send transactions with malicious or invalid ABIs designed to trigger the recursion or improper deserialization. This attack is performed via the blockchain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and broadcast transactions to the EOSIO network with crafted ABI definitions that cause the issues. This implies that the attacker can interact with the blockchain network.

**Technical details and descriptions:**
- The pull request introduces recursion limits to `is_type` and passes `recursion_depth` to `binary_to_variant` and `variant_to_binary` to prevent stack overflows during deserialization.
- The `abi_serializer` is enhanced to handle transactions even with invalid ABI. In such cases, the action data is left in hex format to allow partial deserialization without a valid ABI.
- Additionally, the commit addresses a problem related to base58 encoding where a missing delimiter could cause deserialization to fail, as described in a comment by `jawadhaxan007`.
