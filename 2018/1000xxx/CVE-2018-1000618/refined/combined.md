### @heifner **[heifner](/heifner)** commented [Jun 14, 2018](#issue-332599185) • edited Loading

Enhanced the abi\_serializer to be able to deserialize transactions even if they have invalid abi set on the contract. So even with invalid abi the transaction can still be pretty-printed. In the case of invalid abi the action data is left in hex since there is no way to deserialize it. This allows indexers like the mongodb plugin to serialize the parts of transaction that are serializable without the user provided abi.

I suspect this will fix issue [#4111](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/4111) that was just submitted.

Sorry, something went wrong.
