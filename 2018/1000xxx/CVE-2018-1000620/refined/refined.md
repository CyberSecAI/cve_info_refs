The content relates to CVE-2018-1000620.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `randomDigits()` method generates digits that lack a perfect distribution over enough attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Biased random number generation in the `randomDigits()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The biased output of `randomDigits()` could lead to predictability in systems relying on its output for security purposes (e.g., generation of secret tokens).
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to interact with a system that uses the vulnerable `randomDigits()` method to generate pseudorandom numbers and analyze the generated numbers to exploit the bias.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the capability to observe the output of the `randomDigits()` method or influence a system that uses it.
