Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000885:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `search` parameter in the `/pks/lookup` call of the PHKP application. This parameter is directly passed to the `exec()` function, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection due to the unsanitized input. The `search` parameter, intended for key lookups, is used without proper escaping when constructing the command to be executed by `exec()`.
- The vulnerability is present in two locations: `/pks/lookup?op=index` and `/pks/lookup?op=get`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the PHKP application with the privileges of the web server user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/pks/lookup` endpoint of the PHKP application.
- **Malicious `search` parameter:** The attacker injects shell commands into the `search` query parameter, for example, `http://localhost:8008/pks/lookup?op=index&search=js@example.com; id`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHKP server.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, as the vulnerable code is accessible to any user able to send HTTP requests.
