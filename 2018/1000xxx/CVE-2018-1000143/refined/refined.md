Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000143:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored the webhook secret shared between Jenkins and GitHub in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage:** The webhook secret was stored in plain text instead of being encrypted. This is a critical security flaw because it exposes sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** Users with local file system access to the Jenkins controller or Jenkins administrators could retrieve the webhook secret. This secret could be used by malicious actors to impersonate the webhook.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Exposure of the webhook secret could lead to unauthorized manipulation of the Jenkins build process by the attacker.
*   **Exposure via Browser Extensions, XSS:** Jenkins administrators could potentially expose secrets through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or similar situations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could directly read the file containing the plaintext secret.
*   **Jenkins Administrators:** Jenkins administrators could also obtain this secret through various means like browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, etc.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The attacker needs local file system access to the Jenkins controller or to be a Jenkins administrator.
*   **Jenkins Administrator privileges:**  Jenkins administrators could potentially be vulnerable through browser extensions or other means.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin version 1.32.1 and newer, where the webhook secret is stored encrypted.
*   The advisory recommends revoking the exposed webhook secrets for affected instances.
*   This CVE is related to the `ghprb` plugin.

This vulnerability was assigned a low CVSS score, despite allowing information disclosure, because it requires specific conditions to be exploited.
