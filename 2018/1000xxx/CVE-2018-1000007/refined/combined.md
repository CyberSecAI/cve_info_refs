Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] curl auth/cookie leak on redirect

Auth/cookie leak on redirect
============================

Project curl Security Advisory, April 27 2022 -
[Permalink](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html>)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the
same host but another port number.

When asked to send custom headers or cookies in its HTTP requests, curl sends
that set of headers only to the host which name is used in the initial URL, so
that redirects to other hosts will make curl send the data to those. However,
due to a flawed check, curl wrongly also sends that same set of headers to the
hosts that are identical to the first one but use a different port number or
URL scheme. Contrary to expectation and intention.

Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a
problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`
headers, as those headers often contain privacy sensitive information or data.

curl and libcurl have options that allow users to opt out from this check, but
that is not set by default.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This flaw was added in curl 4.9 with the introduction of `--location` and has
been present in all libcurl versions ever released. In July 2000 in the curl
7.1.1 release, [this commit](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/29eda80f9669f>) was the first
version that attempted to avoid this, but the check has been bad since then.

In 2018, [CVE-2018-1000007](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html>) was
reported that partly addressed this area - but in an incomplete way.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-27776 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Low

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 4.9 to and including 7.82.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 4.9 and curl >= 7.83.0

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always advertised
as such.

THE SOLUTION
------------

In curl version 7.83.0, the same-host check is extended to check the port
number and protocol as well.

A [fix for CVE-2022-27776](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6e659993952aa5f90f488>)

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.83.0

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Do not enable `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` if you pass on custom
      `Authorization:` headers or cookies.

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 21, 2022. We contacted
distros@...nwall on April 22.

libcurl 7.83.0 was released on April 27 2022, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

CREDITS
-------

This issue was reported by Harry Sintonen. Patched by Daniel Stenberg.

Thanks a lot!

# Welcome to Red Hat Bugzilla

Thank you for visiting Red Hat Bugzilla. Red Hat Bugzilla is the Red Hat bug-tracking
system and is used to submit and review defects that have been found in Red
Hat distributions. Red Hat Bugzilla is not an avenue for
technical assistance or support, but simply a bug tracking system. If you submit a
defect, please provide detailed information in your submission after you
have queried Red Hat Bugzilla to ensure the defect has not been reported yet.
Defects will go directly to the engineer responsible for the component you
filed the defect against. Engineers have many responsibilities and will get to
your defect in due time.

If you are a Red Hat customer with an active subscription, please
visit the  [Red Hat Customer Portal](http://access.redhat.com)
for assistance with your issue.

If you are a Fedora Project user and require assistance, please consider using one

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1575536#c0)  Adam Mariš    2018-05-07 08:37:41 UTC  ``` curl can be tricked into reading data beyond the end of a heap based buffer used to store downloaded content.  When servers send RTSP responses back to curl, the data starts out with a set of headers. curl parses that data to separate it into a number of headers to deal with those appropriately and to find the end of the headers that signal the start of the "body" part.  The function that splits up the response into headers is called `Curl_http_readwrite_headers()` and in situations where it can't find a single header in the buffer, it might end up leaving a pointer pointing into the buffer instead of to the start of the buffer which then later on may lead to an out of buffer read when code assumes that pointer points to a full buffer size worth of memory to use.  This could potentially lead to information leakage but most likely a crash/denial of service for applications if a server triggers this flaw.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c0)  Adam Mariš    2018-01-22 13:45:33 UTC  ``` It was found that libcurl might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties.  When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value.  Sending the same set of headers to subsequest hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.  This bug has existed since before curl 6.0.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c1)  Adam Mariš    2018-01-22 13:45:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Curl project Upstream: Craig de Stigter   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c2)  Adam Mariš    2018-01-22 13:46:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1384445](attachment.cgi?id=1384445&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1384445&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c3)  Adam Mariš    2018-01-24 08:09:25 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-b3bf.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c4)  Adam Mariš    2018-01-24 08:10:34 UTC  ``` Created curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1537968](show_bug.cgi?id=1537968 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1000007 curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1537966](show_bug.cgi?id=1537966 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-1000007 mingw-curl: curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1537967](show_bug.cgi?id=1537967 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2018-1000007 mingw-curl: curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2018-02-05 16:26:23 UTC  ``` Ceph uses libcurl in the rados gateway (RGW) only. By default CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is disabled and thus 3xx are returned rather than followed (<https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION.html>). RGW does not override default, and thus is not vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c10)  Cedric Buissart    2018-03-29 12:51:52 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  By default, curl and libcurl will not follow redirect requests. This flaw happens only when curl or libcurl are explicitly requested to follow redirects (option --location in curl, and CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION in libcurl). To mitigate this, it is possible to prevent the automated following of redirects, replacing it by manual redirects (and remove the authentication header), for example.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1537125#c15)  Cedric Buissart    2018-04-19 07:28:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, as well as the versions of httpd24-curl as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 219 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2566015.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3558)

## Topic

An update for httpd24-httpd, httpd24-nghttp2, and httpd24-curl is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server. The httpd24 packages provide a recent stable release of version 2.4 of the Apache HTTP Server, along with the mod\_auth\_kerb module.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: httpd24-httpd (2.4.34), httpd24-curl (7.61.1). (BZ#1590833, BZ#1648928)

Security Fix(es):

* httpd: Improper handling of headers in mod\_session can allow a remote user to modify session data for CGI applications (CVE-2018-1283)
* httpd: Out of bounds read in mod\_cache\_socache can allow a remote attacker to cause DoS (CVE-2018-1303)
* httpd: mod\_http2: Too much time allocated to workers, possibly leading to DoS (CVE-2018-1333)
* httpd: DoS for HTTP/2 connections by continuous SETTINGS frames (CVE-2018-11763)
* httpd: Out of bounds write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values (CVE-2017-15710)
* httpd: <FilesMatch> bypass with a trailing newline in the file name (CVE-2017-15715)
* httpd: Out of bounds access after failure in reading the HTTP request (CVE-2018-1301)
* httpd: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod\_auth\_digest (CVE-2018-1312)
* curl: Multiple security issues were fixed in httpd24-curl (CVE-2016-5419, CVE-2016-5420, CVE-2016-5421, CVE-2016-7141, CVE-2016-7167, CVE-2016-8615, CVE-2016-8616, CVE-2016-8617, CVE-2016-8618, CVE-2016-8619, CVE-2016-8620, CVE-2016-8621, CVE-2016-8622, CVE-2016-8623, CVE-2016-8624, CVE-2016-8625, CVE-2016-9586, CVE-2017-1000100, CVE-2017-1000101, CVE-2017-1000254, CVE-2017-1000257, CVE-2017-7407, CVE-2017-8816, CVE-2017-8817, CVE-2018-1000007, CVE-2018-1000120, CVE-2018-1000121, CVE-2018-1000122, CVE-2018-1000301, CVE-2018-14618)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Curl project for reporting CVE-2017-8816, CVE-2017-8817, CVE-2017-1000254, CVE-2017-1000257, CVE-2018-1000007, CVE-2018-1000120, CVE-2018-1000122, CVE-2018-1000301, CVE-2016-9586, CVE-2017-1000100, CVE-2017-1000101, CVE-2018-14618, and CVE-2018-1000121. Upstream acknowledges Alex Nichols as the original reporter of CVE-2017-8816; the OSS-Fuzz project as the original reporter of CVE-2017-8817 and CVE-2018-1000301; Max Dymond as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000254 and CVE-2018-1000122; Brian Carpenter and the OSS-Fuzz project as the original reporters of CVE-2017-1000257; Craig de Stigter as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000007; Duy Phan Thanh as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000120; Even Rouault as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000100; Brian Carpenter as the original reporter of CVE-2017-1000101; Zhaoyang Wu as the original reporter of CVE-2018-14618; and Dario Weisser as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000121.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the Apache HTTP Server from the httpd24 Software Collection was unable to handle situations when static content was repeatedly requested in a browser by refreshing the page. As a consequence, HTTP/2 connections timed out and httpd became unresponsive. This bug has been fixed, and HTTP/2 connections now work as expected in the described scenario. (BZ#1518737)

Enhancement(s):

* This update adds the mod\_md module to the httpd24 Software Collection. This module enables managing domains across virtual hosts and certificate provisioning using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. The mod\_md module is available only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. (BZ#1640722)

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Software Collections 3.2 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1610998#c0)  Derek Whatley    2018-08-01 20:40:27 UTC  ``` Description of problem: ------------------------ Installing libcurl >= 7.29.0-47 on a RHEL 7 EC2 instance causes failure during the yum repo metadata retrieval process (e.g. yum clean all && yum repolist all) under certain conditions.  This doesn't happen on stock RHEL 7 EC2 instances, but after adding certain additional repos (RH-internal repos containing packages for OpenShift, RHEL, Ceph, etc) the `yum repolist all` process will fail while attempting to pull repo metadata from RHUI AWS repos with `401 unauthorized`. This only happens with libcurl > 7.29.0-47 also installed.  I've isolated the issue to libcurl-7.29.0-47 by updating one package at a time until the issue starts occurring. The issue does _not_ occur in 7.29.0-46, but starts in 47.  All of the RH-internal repos that cause this problem share the same `sslclientcert` and `sslclientkey` in their yum configuration files.  Pulling yum repo metadata for _only_ AWS RHUI repos or _only_ RH-internal repos in separate transactions eliminates the problem.   I'm very willing to gather any additional debugging info needed, please just let me know how to get it and I'll do so.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): -------------------------------------------------------------- libcurl >= 7.29.0-47  How reproducible: ------------------ Every time.  Steps to Reproduce: -------------------- 1. Launch a RHEL 7.5 EC2 instance  2. Run `yum clean all && yum repolist all` to verify there is no issue  3. Install RH-internal repos (e.g. rhel-7-ceph) 4.

I am pretty sure, this is caused by the fix for [bug #1510247](show_bug.cgi?id=1510247 "CLOSED ERRATA - make libcurl use the new PK11_CreateManagedGenericObject() function with nss-3.34 and newer").  My guess is that it prematurely removes a key object shared by multiple connections.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1610998#c7)  Kamil Dudka    2018-08-03 15:19:58 UTC  ``` The fix for [bug #1510247](show_bug.cgi?id=1510247 "CLOSED ERRATA - make libcurl use the new PK11_CreateManagedGenericObject() function with nss-3.34 and newer") revealed multiple hidden bugs in nss-pem.  The scenario where nss-pem breaks is following:  1. load client cert #1 and the corresponding private key  2. unload private key only (because client cert is referred by session cache)  3. load client cert #2 and the corresponding private key  4. attempt to reuse cert #1 and reload the corresponding private key  5. PK11_FindPrivateKeyFromCert() fails in the SelectClientCert() callback  The step 2. did not exist until [bug #1510247](show_bug.cgi?id=1510247 "CLOSED ERRATA - make libcurl use the new PK11_CreateManagedGenericObject() function with nss-3.34 and newer") was fixed.  The actual breakage happens in step 4. because the reused certificate still refers to the originally loaded private key, which has been removed in step 2.  In order to fix this, the reference needs to be updated while reusing the certificate object such that it refers to the private key that is going to be loaded by the subsequent call to PK11_CreateManagedGenericObject().   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1610998#c8)  Kamil Dudka    2018-08-03 15:22:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1473033](attachment.cgi?id=1473033&action=diff "proposed fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1473033&action=edit "proposed fix") proposed fix   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1610998#c15)  Kamil Dudka    2018-08-08 12:50:49 UTC  ``` upstream commits:  <https://github.com/kdudka/nss-pem/commit/1d51c233> <https://github.com/kdudka/nss-pem/commit/e85b6f90> <https://github.com/kdudka/nss-pem/commit/5e6d9ce0> <https://github.com/kdudka/nss-pem/commit/0eafa24f> <https://github.com/kdudka/nss-pem/commit/e14465a1>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1610998#c21)  Pavlina Bartikova    2018-08-28 10:58:30 UTC  ``` Tested with RHEL-7.6_HVM_BETA-20180814-x86_64-0-Access2-GP2 (ami-011349ad9596eb082) AMI, eu-west-1 region.

## CVE-2018-1000007

# HTTP authentication leak in redirects

Project curl Security Advisory, January 24th 2018 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl might leak authentication data to third parties.

When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, curl sends
that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if
asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to
the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header
value.

Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular
a problem for applications that pass on custom
`Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains
privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to
impersonate the curl-using client's request.

## INFO

This bug has existed since before curl 6.0. It existed in the first
commit we have recorded in the project.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2018-1000007 to this issue.

CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl 6.0 to and including [7.57.0](vuln-7.57.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < 6.0 and curl >= [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d514d>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such.

## SOLUTION

In curl version [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html), custom `Authorization:` headers
are limited the same way other such headers is controlled within curl:
they are only sent to the host used in the original URL unless curl is
told that it is OK to pass on to others using the
`[CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH.html)` option.

**NOTE**: this solution creates a slight change in
behavior. Users who actually want to pass on the header to other hosts
now need to give curl that specific permission. You do this with [--location-trusted](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--location-trusted)
with the curl command line tool.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/af32cd3859336ab>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

C - Do not enable [CURLOPT\_FOLLOWLOCATION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION.html) if you pass on custom
Authorization headers

## TIMELINE

It was reported to the curl project on January 18, 2018

We contacted distros@openwall on January 19.

curl [7.58.0](vuln-7.58.0.html) was released on January 24 2018, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Currently,  the  only  supported               option  is  "SRP",  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If --tlsuser and               --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then  this               option defaults to "SRP".  (Added in 7.21.4)         --tlspassword <password>               Set  password  for use with the TLS authentication method speci‐               fied with --tlsauthtype.

Requires  that  --tlspassword  also  be               set.  (Added in 7.21.4)  ---  Looking at configure in the srpm it appears that --enable-tls-srp must be specified for it to actually work which is not in the spec file.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c3)  Kamil Dudka    2018-02-06 11:43:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Chris Cheney from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c0)) > Looking at configure in the srpm it appears that --enable-tls-srp must be > specified for it to actually work which is not in the spec file.  Unfortunately, it is not that easy.  You would need to link libcurl with OpenSSL or GnuTLS whereas RHEL-7 libcurl is linked with NSS.  And even with OpenSSL, the TLS-SRP support was introduced in Fedora just recently because of legal reasons (and it broke ABI compatibility with libcurl).  See [bug #1462211 comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1462211#c4 "CLOSED WONTFIX - symbol SSL_CTX_set_srp_username, version OPENSSL_1_1_0 not defined in file libssl.so.1.1 with link time reference").   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c7)  Kamil Dudka    2018-02-12 09:39:12 UTC  ``` Yes, we should mention that --tlsauthtype works only if the support for TLS-SRP is compiled in.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c8)  Kamil Dudka    2018-02-12 12:40:57 UTC  ``` I have created a pull request upstream:  <https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2306>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c9)  Kamil Dudka    2018-02-12 17:13:27 UTC  ``` upstream commit:  <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/08029a7e>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1542256#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 10:40:37 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled certain data. An attacker

could possibly use this to cause a denial of service or even to get access

to sensitive data. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10.

It was discovered that curl could accidentally leak authentication data.

An attacker could possibly use this to get access to sensitive information.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000005 CVE-2018-1000007

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.

CVE-2018-1000005

    Zhouyihai Ding discovered an out-of-bounds read in the code
    handling HTTP/2 trailers. This issue doesn't affect the oldstable
    distribution (jessie).

CVE-2018-1000007

    Craig de Stigter discovered that authentication data might be leaked
    to third parties when following HTTP redirects.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u9.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-03-07 13:07:21 UTC  ```  It was found that curl can be fooled into writing a zero byte out of bounds.  This bug can trigger when curl is told to work on an FTP URL, with the setting to only issue a single CWD command (`--ftp-method singlecwd` or the libcurl alternative `CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD`).  curl then URL-decodes the given path, calls strlen() on the result and deducts the length of the file name part to find the end of the directory within the buffer. It then writes a zero byte on that index, in a buffer allocated on the heap.  If the directory part of the URL contains a "%00" sequence, the directory length might end up shorter than the file name path, making the calculation `size_t index = directory_len - filepart_len` end up with a huge index variable for where the zero byte gets stored: `heap_buffer[index] = 0`. On several architectures that huge index will wrap and work as a negative value, thus overwriting memory *before* the intended heap buffer.  By using different file part lengths and putting %00 in different places in the URL, an attacker that can control what paths a curl-using application uses can write that zero byte on different indexes.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-03-07 13:07:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Curl project Upstream: Duy Phan Thanh   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2018-03-07 13:17:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1405333](attachment.cgi?id=1405333&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1405333&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c4)  Cedric Buissart    2018-03-13 20:57:48 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Preventing application from using non-default CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD will avoid triggering the vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c5)  Adam Mariš    2018-03-14 07:30:53 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-9cd6.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c6)  Adam Mariš    2018-03-14 07:33:39 UTC  ``` Created mingw-curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1555207](show_bug.cgi?id=1555207 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2018-1000120 CVE-2018-1000121 CVE-2018-1000122 mingw-curl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   Created curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1555209](show_bug.cgi?id=1555209 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1000120 CVE-2018-1000121 CVE-2018-1000122 curl: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1555208](show_bug.cgi?id=1555208 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-1000120 CVE-2018-1000121 CVE-2018-1000122 mingw-curl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2018-03-14 08:35:48 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:   FTP: reject path components with control codes  <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/535432c0ad>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:43:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3157 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3157](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3157)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-13 08:35:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2018:3558 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3558)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c14)  Pandian    2019-05-13 11:58:57 UTC  ``` I have used 7.35 version ...

It is not surprising that the patch does not cleanly apply on curl 7.35.0.  In [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1552628#c15) I pointed you to the actual patch that Red Hat applied on top of curl 7.29.0, which RHEL-7 packages of curl are based.  Feel free to use any of the patches as you like.  As far as I know, curl 7.35.0 is not used in any products currently supported by Red Hat.  So we are not going to provide patches for this upstream release of curl.  That is not our business.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3157)

## Topic

An update for curl and nss-pem is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

The nss-pem package provides the PEM file reader for Network Security Services (NSS) implemented as a PKCS#11 module.

Security Fix(es):

* curl: HTTP authentication leak in redirects (CVE-2018-1000007)
* curl: FTP path trickery leads to NIL byte out of bounds write (CVE-2018-1000120)
* curl: RTSP RTP buffer over-read (CVE-2018-1000122)
* curl: Out-of-bounds heap read when missing RTSP headers allows information leak of denial of service (CVE-2018-1000301)
* curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2018-1000121)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Curl project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Craig de Stigter as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000007; Duy Phan Thanh as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000120; Max Dymond as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000122; the OSS-fuzz project as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000301; and Dario Weisser as the original reporter of CVE-2018-1000121.
