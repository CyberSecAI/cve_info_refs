Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000007:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from curl's handling of custom headers, specifically `Authorization:` or `Cookie:` headers, during HTTP redirects. When `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` is enabled and a 30x HTTP redirect response is received, curl forwards these custom headers to the new host specified in the Location header. This behavior is intended when the same host is used but the check for same host was incomplete.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Authentication and Cookie Leakage:** curl sends the custom authorization and cookie headers to the redirected host, even when the port number or URL scheme is different from the origin host, violating the intended same-host policy.
-   **Insufficient Credentials Protection:**  The credentials, especially authorization tokens and cookie data, are insufficiently protected and exposed to unintended hosts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information contained in headers (`Authorization:` , `Cookie:`) can be leaked to a malicious third party server via HTTP redirects, where a malicious server could impersonate the curl user's requests. This allows a malicious server to obtain sensitive data.
-   **Security/Privacy Violation:** Disclosure of privacy sensitive data or information from `Authorization:` and `Cookie:` headers.

**Attack vectors:**

-  **HTTP Redirects:** An attacker controls an initial server which provides a redirect to a different server on the same host but on a different port/scheme and receives custom header information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Control Over Redirect Target:** The attacker needs to control the server specified in the redirect (`Location:`) header, or be able to intercept the request on the network.
-   **Trigger a Redirect:** Must be able to induce the curl client to follow a 30x HTTP redirect.
-   **Target must enable `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION`:** For the vulnerability to be exposed, the curl client must follow redirects via option `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` or the `--location` command-line argument.
