Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000198:

**Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The Black Duck Hub Plugin's `/descriptorByName/com.blackducksoftware.integration.hub.jenkins.PostBuildHubScan/config.xml` API endpoint was vulnerable due to improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE). The plugin processed XML documents without disabling external entity processing.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The plugin did not disable XML external entity processing.
*   The API endpoint was accessible to users with Overall/Read permission, allowing them to submit maliciously crafted XML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially extract secrets from the Jenkins controller by exploiting the XXE vulnerability to read local files.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could use the vulnerability to make requests to internal resources, potentially leading to further attacks.
*  **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Attackers could craft XML documents that cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A user with Overall/Read access sends a POST request with a maliciously crafted XML document to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins controller.

**Affected Plugin:**
* Black Duck Hub Plugin

**Affected Versions:**
* Up to and including 3.0.3
* Up to and including 3.1.0

**Fix:**
* Black Duck Hub Plugin version 4.0.0 and newer no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents submitted to this endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text indicates that the plugin distribution has been suspended.
