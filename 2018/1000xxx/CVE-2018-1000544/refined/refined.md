{
  "CVE-2018-1000544": {
    "Description": "The rubyzip gem version 1.2.1 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal vulnerability in the Zip::File component. This vulnerability allows writing arbitrary files to the filesystem by including symlinks or files with absolute pathnames in a zip archive.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of file paths within a zip archive during extraction, specifically not sanitizing absolute paths and symbolic links.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Arbitrary file write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could write arbitrary files to the filesystem, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new ones in locations outside of the intended extraction directory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker overwrites an executable or configuration file with malicious code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious zip archive containing files with absolute paths or symbolic links.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload or provide a malicious zip archive to an application using the vulnerable rubyzip library. The application must then attempt to extract the contents of the zip file."
