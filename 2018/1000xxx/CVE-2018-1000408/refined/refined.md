### Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2018-1000408

**Description:**

By accessing a specific crafted URL on Jenkins instances using *Jenkins' own user database*, users without Overall/Read access could create ephemeral user records. This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral user records in memory.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that a specific URL on Jenkins instances (using Jenkins' own user database) allows the creation of ephemeral user records even by users without Overall/Read access.

**Impact:**

An attacker could create a large number of ephemeral user records in memory, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vector:**

Accessing a specific crafted URL on a Jenkins instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

No Overall/Read access is required. The attacker needs to be able to access the crafted URL.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Jenkins weekly up to and including 2.145
*   Jenkins LTS up to and including 2.138.1

**Fix:**

Update to Jenkins weekly version 2.146 or Jenkins LTS version 2.138.2.
