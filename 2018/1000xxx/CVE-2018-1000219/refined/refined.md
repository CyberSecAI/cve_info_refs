Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `fax_view.php` file. Specifically, the `file` and `scan` parameters passed via HTTP GET requests are not properly sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `file` or `scan` parameters, an attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed within the context of a victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive user information
    *   Defacing the web page
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** By hijacking a user's session or stealing their credentials, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the OpenEMR system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to `fax_view.php`. The malicious JavaScript code is embedded within the `file` or `scan` parameters of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the OpenEMR server where the vulnerable `fax_view.php` file resides.
*   **Social Engineering:** In many XSS attacks, social engineering is required to entice the victim to click the malicious URL.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid account to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the `interface/fax/fax_view.php` file of OpenEMR.
*   The vulnerable code directly uses the `$_GET['file']` and `$_GET['scan']` parameters to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
*   The code processes the file path, and then outputs the file (or converts the file to a PDF before output) based on the extension. If a user provides a malicious file name with an svg tag (e.g. `<svg/onload=alert(1)>`), the browser will execute the embedded javascript.
*   The provided proof of concept URLs demonstrate how to inject JavaScript code using the `file` and `scan` parameters.

http://192.168.246.144/openemr-5.0.1/interface/fax/fax_view.php?file=%3Csvg/onload=alert(1)%3E
http://192.168.246.144/openemr-5.0.1/interface/fax/fax_view.php?scan=%3Csvg/onload=alert(1)%3E
```
The `%3Csvg/onload=alert(1)%3E` part is URL encoded form of `<svg/onload=alert(1)>` which is a simple payload used to test for XSS.
