{
  "CVE-2018-1000075": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A negative size in the ruby gem package tar header.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by a negative size in the ruby gem package tar header, which could lead to an infinite loop.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A denial-of-service due to an infinite loop.",
    "Attack vectors": "A maliciously crafted gem package containing a tar header with a negative size value.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious gem package."
  },
  "CVE-2018-1000076": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper verification of signatures in tarball",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Ruby gems package improperly verifies cryptographic signatures, potentially allowing installation of a mis-signed gem if the tarball contains multiple gem signatures.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Installation of a mis-signed gem, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A maliciously crafted gem package with multiple gem signatures in the tarball.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a mis-signed gem package."
  },
    "CVE-2018-1000077": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input validation in the gem specification homepage attribute.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing URL validation in the homepage attribute of the gem specification, which allows a malicious gem to set an invalid homepage URL.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious gem can set an invalid homepage URL.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious gem package with a crafted homepage URL.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious gem package with a crafted homepage URL."
  },
    "CVE-2018-1000078": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in gem server display of homepage attribute.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "XSS vulnerability exists in gem server display of the homepage attribute.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious code via the homepage attribute that can execute when displayed via gem server.",
    "Attack vectors": "A maliciously crafted gem with a payload embedded in the homepage attribute. A victim must then browse the malicious gem via a vulnerable gem server.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious gem with an XSS payload embedded in the homepage and have a victim browse to it using a vulnerable gem server."
