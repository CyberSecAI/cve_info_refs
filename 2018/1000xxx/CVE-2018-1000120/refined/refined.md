Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000120, CVE-2018-1000121, and CVE-2018-1000122:

**CVE-2018-1000120**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability in curl's handling of FTP URLs, specifically when using the `CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD` option set to `FTPFILE_NOCWD` (or the equivalent `--ftp-method singlecwd` command-line option). The issue arises from improper URL decoding and subsequent buffer length calculation when processing the directory part of the URL which leads to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper URL decoding leading to incorrect path length calculation
    *   Out-of-bounds write of a null byte due to incorrect index calculation: `size_t index = directory_len - filepart_len` can become negative and wrap around, causing write *before* the heap buffer
*  **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary NULL byte write in memory potentially leading to:
         *   Program crash.
         *   Unspecified behavior.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious actor able to control the FTP URL used by a curl-using application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to supply a specially crafted FTP URL to a curl-using application.
   
**CVE-2018-1000121**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in curl's LDAP URL handling. When using `ldap_get_attribute_ber()` to get attribute data from an LDAP server, it can return `LDAP_SUCCESS` but also a `NULL` pointer, which then gets dereferenced by curl leading to a crash.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of NULL pointer check after calling the `ldap_get_attribute_ber()` function.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crash due to NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious LDAP server.
    *   Applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that allow redirects to LDAP URLs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to control a malicious LDAP server and direct a vulnerable curl client to it or via a redirect.

**CVE-2018-1000122**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability in curl's handling of RTSP URLs. When transferring data from an RTSP URL, curl can miscalculate the data length, causing it to copy data beyond the end of its heap-based buffer.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper calculation of data length, leading to memcpy read beyond buffer size.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential information leakage from heap memory.
    *   Denial-of-service due to program crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious RTSP server sending a specially crafted RTSP reply.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to control a malicious RTSP server that will communicate with curl.

**Additional Information from the content:**

*   These vulnerabilities are all related to the curl library and are fixed in curl version 7.59.0.
*   Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu released patches to address these issues in their respective distributions.
*   The upstream patches are available on the curl GitHub repository.
*   Mitigations involve preventing usage of non-default `CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD` to avoid triggering the vulnerable code in the FTP case (CVE-2018-1000120).
*   Mitigation involves preventing automated redirection to LDAP URLs for CVE-2018-1000121.
*   For the RTSP case (CVE-2018-1000122), avoid connecting to untrusted RTSP servers.
*   Some vendors used backporting to apply security fixes to older versions of curl.
