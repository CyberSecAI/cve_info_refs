Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10722:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure file system permissions and the ability to manipulate file paths via mount points and symbolic links within the CylancePROTECT software. Specifically, the Cylance update service (`CyUpdate.exe`) grants "Modify" permissions to standard users on the log folder and any log files it writes. This allows an attacker to redirect the log file creation path to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure File Permissions:** The Cylance update service grants standard users modify permissions on its log folder and log files, which is unusual for a service that runs with SYSTEM privileges.
2.  **Mount Point Vulnerability:** The ability to modify the log folder allowed an attacker to create a mount point, redirecting write operations to another location.
3.  **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The attacker leveraged symbolic links to control the filename of the log file being written by the Cylance update service. This allowed the attacker to overwrite an arbitrary file with attacker controlled content.
4.  **DLL Hijacking:** The Cylance update service, upon startup, attempts to load `libc.dll` from the Cylance directory. By controlling the filename and content, the attacker could place a malicious DLL in the directory which would be loaded and executed as SYSTEM by the update service.
5.  **Lack of Path Sanitization:** The Cylance software did not properly sanitize or validate the file paths used for log file operations which allowed for the redirection via mount points and symbolic links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting the DLL hijacking vulnerability in the CyUpdate.exe process.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, allowing for full control over the system.
*   **Service Disruption:** By exploiting the SYSTEM privileges, the attacker can communicate with the Cylance kernel driver and stop the CylanceSvc service.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the target machine.
2.  **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates a mount point and a chain of symbolic links to redirect log file creation to an arbitrary location, allowing them to control the filename and content.
3.  **Triggering Update Service:** The attacker uses the CylanceUI process's inter-process communication (IPC) channel to trigger the update process (`CyUpdate.exe`) which attempts to write to a log file.
4.  **DLL Hijacking:** The attacker places a malicious DLL in the path searched by the update service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Standard User Access:** The attacker must have a standard user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Create Mount Points and Symbolic Links:** The attacker needs the ability to create mount points and symbolic links. They can use publicly available tools like the "symboliclink-testing-tools" to achieve this.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Windows File System:** The attacker needs to understand how mount points and symbolic links can manipulate file paths.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ryan Hanson of Atredis Partners.
*   Cylance was notified and a patch was released in version 1470 of CylancePROTECT.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the identifier `ATREDIS-2018-0003` by Atredis Partners.
*   The vulnerability was remediated within approximately 40 days of initial report to Cylance.
