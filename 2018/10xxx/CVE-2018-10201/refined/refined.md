  "cveId": "CVE-2018-10201",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in NcMonitorServer.exe in NC Monitor Server in NComputing vSpace Pro 10 and 11. It is possible to read arbitrary files outside the root directory of the web server. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely by a crafted URL without credentials, with …/ or …\\ or …./ or ….\\ as a directory-traversal pattern to TCP port 8667.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing file paths, allowing path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files outside the web server's root directory, potentially exposing sensitive data such as password hashes, application hardcodes, history files, log files, and databases. This could also enable attackers to gather information about the system, such as the operating system, software, hardware, drivers, and network configuration. In some cases, it can lead to complete control over the server. Furthermore, it could potentially lead to an excessive usage of hardware resources (CPU, RAM, HD, and Network) leading to Denial of Service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A crafted URL with directory traversal sequences (../, ..\\, etc.) sent to TCP port 8667."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Remote network access to the target server (TCP port 8667) is required. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
    ]
