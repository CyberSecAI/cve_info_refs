  "cveId": "CVE-2018-10839",
  "description": "QEMU emulator built with the NE2000 NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which could lead to buffer overflow issue. It could occur when receiving packets over the network. A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in DoS.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Integer overflow in the NE2000 NIC emulation during packet reception.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the QEMU process. Potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network packets sent to the emulated NIC.",
        "A user inside the guest OS can trigger the vulnerability"
    ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the emulated NE2000 NIC. A privileged user/process inside guest."
