Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Admin Site title" field within the Frog CMS settings page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious payload in the database. Subsequently, when the vulnerable page is rendered, the stored JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page. This code executes when a user visits the affected page.
- **Account compromise/data theft:** The attacker can potentially perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Admin Site title" field in the settings page of Frog CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the settings page in Frog CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to input malicious JavaScript within the admin site title field.
- Any user that visits the affected page will trigger the injected payload.
