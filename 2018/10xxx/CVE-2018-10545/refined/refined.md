**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The core issue is that PHP-FPM sets child processes as dumpable after changing UID and GID. This allows a local user, with matching UID and GID, to use `ptrace` to access the memory space of these FPM workers. This bypasses the intended access controls of opcache, which is shared among FPM worker processes and stores sensitive data.
    * The `fpm_unix.c` source code is responsible for setting the `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag.
    *   This is a privilege escalation issue.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Bypass of opcache access controls**: Due to FPM worker processes being dumpable, the opcache access controls intended to isolate different user environments can be bypassed by an attacker with the same UID and GID as the targeted application.
    *   **Memory exposure:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials and other configuration data, can be read directly from memory of the FPM worker processes by a local user if they gain access via the `ptrace` call.
   *   **Incorrect configuration:** the `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag should not be set in FPM child processes by default.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious local user can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords and other configuration settings, that are stored in the memory of FPM worker processes belonging to other users.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** A user can escalate privileges to access sensitive data belonging to other users.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By repeatedly crashing the FPM worker process, a malicious user may cause a denial of service.
    *   **Bypassing intended security controls**: Opcache access controls are bypassed.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local exploitation: An attacker with shell access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.
    *   `ptrace` system call (Linux): Allows a user to attach to and dump the memory of other processes.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User Access:**  The attacker must have a shell account on the same system where PHP-FPM is running.
    *   **Same UID/GID:** The attacker's user account must have the same UID and GID as the targeted application's FPM worker processes for the exploit to work.
    *   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic skills to use tools like `gcore` or similar to dump process memory and extract data using tools like `strings`.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PHP versions before 5.6.35, 7.0.x before 7.0.29, 7.1.x before 7.1.16, and 7.2.x before 7.2.4.
*   Patches involve removing the `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE...)` call in `fpm_unix.c` or adding a configuration option to control it.
*   The vulnerability is related to how FPM manages worker processes after changing user and group IDs (UID/GID).
*   The issue is more relevant in shared hosting environments, where different user pools may exist on the same server.
*   This vulnerability is related to a previous issue (`CVE-2018-5712`)
*   A fix was added to the PHP code and a configuration setting was proposed to control `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` flag.

In summary, CVE-2018-10545 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that arises due to insecure handling of process dumpability in PHP-FPM, enabling local users to access sensitive information from other user's FPM worker processes. The provided content offers a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and remediation.
