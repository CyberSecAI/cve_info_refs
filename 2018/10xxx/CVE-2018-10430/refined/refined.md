The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DiliCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and displaying it on the web page. Specifically, the fourth textbox in the "System setting -> site setting" section allows for unescaped HTML to be stored.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the system settings, which will be executed whenever a user views the affected page. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Other malicious activities that the injected script can perform.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the DiliCMS backend in order to modify the system settings.
- The attacker provides a malicious payload containing JavaScript code via the "System setting -> site setting" page's fourth textbox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the DiliCMS backend.
- The attacker needs the ability to input data into the "System setting -> site setting" page.
