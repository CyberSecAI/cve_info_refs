Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The document states that "By combining a number of discovered vulnerabilities an adversary may be able to compromise affected Axis products."  It does not specify the root cause of this particular CVE (CVE-2018-10664) but rather implies it is one of a group of vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The advisory mentions multiple CVEs (CVE-2018-10658, CVE-2018-10659, CVE-2018-10660, CVE-2018-10661, CVE-2018-10662, CVE-2018-10663, and CVE-2018-10664) that, when combined, can lead to a compromise. However, it doesn't specify the type of vulnerability present in CVE-2018-10664, which makes it difficult to assess its specific weaknesses.
*   The document only provides a list of affected products and their patched firmware versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the affected Axis products.
*   The advisory explicitly states "an adversary may be able to compromise affected Axis products."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is network access to the device.
*   The advisory states that an adversary does not require credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker does not need any prior credentials to successfully execute the attack.
*   Internet-facing devices are considered at high risk.

**Additional Information:**
* The document lists a large number of affected Axis products and the specific firmware versions that address this vulnerability.
* It recommends upgrading firmware, avoiding direct exposure to the internet (port-forwarding) and optionally applying IP filtering.

**Summary:**

The document describes a set of vulnerabilities (including CVE-2018-10664) that can lead to device compromise.  It highlights the severity and the need for prompt patching. However, it lacks specific details about the technical nature of each CVE.  It does not offer a deep technical analysis, focusing instead on providing affected product lists and mitigation steps.
