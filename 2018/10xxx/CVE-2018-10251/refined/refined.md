- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to the presence of default user or viewer passwords on Airlink gateways running older firmware, which are directly reachable from the public internet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of default credentials creates a significant security weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can remotely execute code on the vulnerable gateways after successfully logging in using the default passwords. This allows for malware infections, such as IoTroop/Reaper, which can be installed on the devices.
- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through the public internet, targeting devices that have not changed their default credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable gateway on the public internet and be able to attempt login using default credentials.
