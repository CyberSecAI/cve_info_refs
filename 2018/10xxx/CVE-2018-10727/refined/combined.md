# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Issue description

A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `fabrik_referrer` hidden input field in fabrik forms allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary scripts via the unsanitized HTTP `Referrer` header.

# Example

Given a fabrik form URL, for example `http://www.foo.bar.com/vulnerable-form.html` that contains an input field such as `<input type="hidden" name="fabrik_referrer" value="http://sample.referrer.com" />`, it is possible to reproduce the vulnerability by changing the referrer, for example with `http://sample.referrer.com"accesskey="x"onclick="alert(1)`.

This may be possible via the following cURL command:

`curl -H 'Referer: http://sample.referrer.com"accesskey="x"onclick="alert(1)' 'http://www.foo.bar.com/vulnerable-form.html'`

# CVE ID
