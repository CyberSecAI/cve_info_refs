  "CVE-2018-10326": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization in multiple configuration fields allows for the injection of malicious scripts.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The department field in printer configuration",
        "The description field in the print server configuration",
         "The username field for guest authentication to print"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be authenticated and have the ability to update the configuration of the PrinterOn Enterprise software."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for HTML and JavaScript injection.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Stored XSS"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would be executed in the browsers of users who view the vulnerable fields. This could lead to account compromise or other malicious activities.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The department field in the printer configuration.",
         "The description field in the print server configuration.",
         "The username field for guest authentication to print"
      ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have sufficient privileges to modify the configuration settings."
