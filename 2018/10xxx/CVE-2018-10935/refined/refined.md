{
  "CVE-2018-10935": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the 389 Directory Server that allows users to cause a crash in the LDAP server using ldapsearch with server side sort.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper handling of server side sorting in the ldapsearch utility within the 389 Directory Server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation when handling ldapsearch requests with server-side sorting.",
      "Lack of bounds checking or error handling within the sorting function when the requested attribute is not indexable.",
         "NULL pointer dereference during sort processing due to unhandled NULL values."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the LDAP server, potentially disrupting services that rely on it.",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "An authenticated attacker sends a specially crafted ldapsearch request containing server side sorting extended controls."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the LDAP server.",
      "Attacker must be able to send LDAP queries."
    ],
      "Additional Details": [
          "The crash occurs in the `slapd_qsort` function when an attribute requested for sorting is not indexable.",
          "The issue specifically involves a server-side sort request where matching rules are included and indexed keys for values are set to NULL.",
          "The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault when a NULL pointer is dereferenced during the comparison process."
      ]
