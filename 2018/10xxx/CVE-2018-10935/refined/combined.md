RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1076530#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-01-18 10:04:18 UTC  ``` embargoed via distros  CRD: 2018-01-22  Hi,  Here is a notification about two vulnerabilities in the 389-ds-base package (389 Directory Server).  NOTE: We are planning to make these flaws public on 22-January-2018. If this date changes, we will inform the list.  Patches to fix both these flaws are attached to this email.  I am not subscribed to this list. So please CC me if you have some questions or comments for me.   CVE-2017-15134 --------------  Remote DoS via search filters in slapi_filter_sprintf in slapd/util.c  A stack buffer overflow flaw was found in the way 389-ds-base handled certain LDAP search filters. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to make ns-slapd crash via a specially crafted LDAP request, thus resulting in denial of service.  CVSSv3: 7.5/CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  1. The crash happens at the following line in 389-ds-base-1.3.6.1-21.el7_4.x86_64,  filter_stuff_func (..., slen=32768) at ldap/servers/slapd/util.c:282, which is memcpy(ctx->attr, val, slen).  The ctx->attr storage resides on the caller's stack frame.  char attr[ATTRSIZE]; // ATTRSIZE => 256  2. Both filter_stuff_func and slapi_filter_sprintf functions are protected by SSP ON RHEL 7.4.  Overall, this seems like a stack overflow bug which leads to DoS (server crash).   CVE-2017-15135 --------------  Authentication bypass due to lack of size check in slapi_ct_memcmp function in ch_malloc.c  It was found that 389-ds-base did not always handle internal hash comparison operations correctly during the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass the authentication process under very rare and specific circumstances.  This flaw was introduced by the CVE-2016-5405 fix.  CVSSv3: 4.6/CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  Thanks, Dhiru ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1076530#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2018-01-25 12:06:36 UTC  ``` is public now. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1076530#c9)  William Brown   2019-04-16 02:05:33 UTC  ``` An update to 389-ds source to 1.4.0.22 is recommended to resolve this and many other issues. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1076530#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-05-10 19:21:10 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:1207-1: An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.

Package        : 389-ds-base
Version        : 1.3.3.5-4+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10871 CVE-2018-10935
Debian Bug     : 906985

CVE-2018-10871

    By default nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch was set to 'on'. So a copy of
    the unhashed password was kept in modifiers and was possibly logged in
    changelog and retroCL.

    Unless it is used by some plugin it does not require to keep unhashed
    passwords. The nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch option is now 'off' by
    default.

CVE-2018-10935

    It was discovered that any authenticated user doing a search using
    ldapsearch with extended controls for server side sorting could bring
    down the LDAP server itself.

    The fix is to check if we are able to index the provided value. If we
    are not, then slapd_qsort returns an error (LDAP_OPERATION_ERROR) .

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.3.5-4+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

If the fine-grained password policy is enabled, the "shadowAccount" entry can contain its own "pwdpolicysubentry" policy attribute. Previously, to retrieve this attribute, the server started an internal search for each "shadowAccount" entry, which was unnecessary because the entry was already known to the server. With this update, Directory Server only starts internal searches if the entry is not known. As a result, the performance of searches, such as response time and throughput, is improved. | | | Clone Of: | [1593807](show_bug.cgi?id=1593807 "CLOSED ERRATA - Fine grained password policy can impact search performance") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-09-25 19:06:11 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096368#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-06-07 05:44:40 UTC  ``` rh#1588056  The bug is related to incoming connection handling in DS. A connection data structure contains a refcnt. The refcnt accounts the number of pending requests. When a connection needs to be cleanup (upon closure, timeout...) the core server waits for refcnt to be 0. It basically waits for all pending requests to complete before cleaning the structure.  The refcnt does not account specific LDAP request (persistent search), so if an event occurs on the connection (closure) the core server may reset the structure although a request is still going on.   Anonymous user are allowed to trigger a persistent search so in theory anyone sending persistent search and closing  the connection hits that bug.  Under normal use, most of the time the problem is not detected. Sometime there are error written in the log when an invalid refcnt is found. But depending on dispatch dynamic of the threads handling connection event it can crash.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Synopsis

Moderate: 389-ds-base security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2757)

## Topic

An update for 389-ds-base is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server. The base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and command-line utilities for server administration.

Security Fix(es):

* 389-ds-base: race condition on reference counter leads to DoS using persistent search (CVE-2018-10850)
* 389-ds-base: ldapsearch with server side sort allows users to cause a crash (CVE-2018-10935)
* 389-ds-base: Server crash through modify command with large DN (CVE-2018-14624)
* 389-ds-base: Crash in delete\_passwdPolicy when persistent search connections are terminated unexpectedly (CVE-2018-14638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

The CVE-2018-10850 issue was discovered by Thierry Bordaz (Red Hat) and the CVE-2018-14638 issue was discovered by Viktor Ashirov (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the nucn-stans framework was enabled by default in Directory Server, but the framework is not stable. As a consequence, deadlocks and file descriptor leaks could occur. This update changes the default value of the nsslapd-enable-nunc-stans parameter to "off". As a result, Directory Server is now stable. (BZ#1614836)
* When a search evaluates the "shadowAccount" entry, Directory Server adds the shadow attributes to the entry. If the fine-grained password policy is enabled, the "shadowAccount" entry can contain its own "pwdpolicysubentry" policy attribute. Previously, to retrieve this attribute, the server started an internal search for each "shadowAccount" entry, which was unnecessary because the entry was already known to the server. With this update, Directory Server only starts internal searches if the entry is not known. As a result, the performance of searches, such as response time and throughput, is improved. (BZ#1615924)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, the 389 server service will be restarted automatically.
