Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-10701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Moxa AWK-3121 device allows administrators to run scripts for troubleshooting. However, the `iw_filename` POST parameter in the `/forms/web_runScript` endpoint is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the `iw_filename` parameter during script execution.
*   **Insecure Script Execution:** The device's script execution mechanism lacks proper input validation and sanitization, leading to the buffer overflow and command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Code execution can lead to privilege escalation by allowing the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** This vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The provided information suggests using a CSRF attack to trick an administrator into submitting a malicious request, thereby triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
*   **CSRF Exploitation:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious website or link, which in turn submits a crafted POST request to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `iw_filename` parameter and the required payload structure to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/forms/web_runScript` endpoint.
*   The `iw_filename` parameter must contain a string of at least 162 characters to trigger the overflow.
*   The attacker can insert shell commands within the `iw_filename` parameter, which will be executed by the device after triggering the overflow.
*   The vulnerability affects Moxa AWK-3121 devices with firmware version 1.14.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-10701 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Moxa AWK-3121 router's script execution functionality that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device by submitting a crafted POST request with a specially crafted `iw_filename` parameter. The exploit requires a Cross-Site Request Forgery to trick an administrator into submitting the malicious request.
