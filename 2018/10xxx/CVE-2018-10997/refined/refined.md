Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
*   It exists within the Etere Web application.
*   The injection point is in the `txUserName` and `txPassword` POST parameters during the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the results of the SQL query. Instead, an attacker has to infer information based on the time the application takes to respond. This is achieved using the `WAITFOR DELAY` command in the SQL query.
*   **Pre-authentication Vulnerability**: The SQL injection is present in the login parameters, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application is not properly sanitizing or validating user-supplied input before including it in SQL queries, allowing injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database by exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** In some scenarios, full control of the remote system may be possible, depending on the database configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is done via HTTP POST requests to the login page.
*   **Manipulating txUserName and txPassword parameters:** An attacker manipulates the `txUserName` and `txPassword` parameters within the POST request, injecting malicious SQL code (e.g. `WAITFOR DELAY`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Etere Web application.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Knowledge of crafting HTTP POST requests is needed.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** Understanding of SQL syntax and time-based blind SQL injection techniques is needed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Etere Web version 28.1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dion Bellemare.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, showing how to inject the `WAITFOR DELAY` command via the `txUserName` parameter.
*   The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability and released a fix in version 28.1.20.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication time-based blind SQL injection in the login parameters of Etere Web. This can lead to information disclosure, and in some cases, full system compromise. The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP POST request and manipulate the `txUserName` and `txPassword` parameters to inject SQL code. The vulnerability was addressed in version 28.1.20.
