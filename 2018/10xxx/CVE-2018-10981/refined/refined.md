{
  "CVE-2018-10981": {
    "description": "A device model which switches a request between two states at the right times can drive Xen into an unbounded loop.",
    "root_cause": "Xen failed to reject invalid transitions between states when processing requests from a device model. The state field is in the request itself, where the device model may write to it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unbounded loop due to invalid state transitions"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious unprivileged device model"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a device model within a guest.",
    "notes": "Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. Only HVM guests can expose this vulnerability. PV and PVH guests cannot expose this vulnerability, but note that the domains being able to leverage the vulnerability are PV or PVH ones, running the device model. This vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains."
