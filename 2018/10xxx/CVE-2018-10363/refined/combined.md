I tried to get it to work, but was unable to select dates from the calendar, and there is no way to enter them manually.
I was probably a bit hasty, in my review. I’ll be more diligent next time.
I guess you have to manually specify the available dates ahead of time. Sounds like that might work for some applications. I’ll keep looking for something more suitable.
