  "cve": "CVE-2018-10872",
  "description": "The provided content details a security vulnerability in the Linux kernel, specifically related to error handling during stack switch operations. It is identified as CVE-2018-10872, which is a regression of CVE-2018-8897. This flaw allows an unprivileged local user to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the system kernel.",
  "technical_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is an error in the Linux kernel's exception handling during stack switch operations performed using Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During these operations, the processor delays the delivery of interrupts and exceptions until after the execution of the instruction following the stack switch.",
    "vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability lies in how the kernel manages exceptions immediately following a stack switch operation, leading to a potential DoS.",
    "impact": "An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing the system kernel.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local; it requires the attacker to have local access to the system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an unprivileged local system user."

    "patch_info": "The vulnerability is addressed in the RHSA-2018:2164 security advisory for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. The fix involves a kernel update that modifies exception handling for stack switch operations. Applying the provided update and rebooting the system is required to resolve the issue.",
   "additional_notes": "This CVE (CVE-2018-10872) was assigned due to a regression of CVE-2018-8897 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.10 GA kernel; no other versions are affected by this CVE. The provided Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that microcode updates related to this vulnerability may not be synchronized on 32 and 64-bit AMD and Intel architectures prior to the patch.",
    "oracle_reference": "The content from Oracle's advisory lists CVE-2018-10872 in the context of a larger July 2020 Critical Patch Update, but the details of the vulnerability are not directly described in the context of this CVE. It is listed as a vulnerability fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6."
