Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-10504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Form Maker" WordPress plugin. Specifically, when users submit data through form fields, this data is not properly sanitized before being exported as a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection. This occurs because the plugin does not sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious formulas into form fields. When a user with higher privileges (e.g., admin) exports the form data as a CSV file and opens it with software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, these formulas get executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious CSV formulas, an attacker can achieve remote command execution on the machine of the user who opens the exported CSV file. For example, the provided proof of concept demonstrates launching the calculator application on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Submission:** A public (unauthenticated) user can inject malicious CSV formulas into the form fields of the vulnerable plugin.
*   **CSV Export:** A user with higher privileges within the WordPress application must then export the form data as a CSV.
*   **CSV File Open:** A user must then open the exported CSV file on their local machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be able to submit data to a form generated by the vulnerable plugin and inject the malicious CSV formula.
*   The attacker needs to rely on a privileged user to export and open the CSV for command execution.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses a payload like `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 1.12.20 and earlier of the Form Maker plugin.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.12.24.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content from Exploit-DB includes a proof-of-concept, showing the calculator popping up.
*   The WordPress plugin description explains how to create forms and manage submissions, highlighting the plugin's functionality.
