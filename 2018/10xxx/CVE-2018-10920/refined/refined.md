Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-10920:

**Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the DNS resolver component of Knot Resolver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation within the DNS resolver component. This allows an attacker to introduce malicious data into the DNS cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to poison the DNS cache. In certain circumstances, this can lead to the hijacking of DNS domains.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to have control over a rogue authoritative DNS server. The attacker needs to trigger a query from the vulnerable resolver to this rogue authoritative server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have control of an authoritative DNS server.
*   The attacker must be able to induce the vulnerable resolver to query the attacker-controlled server.
*   The attacker needs to craft specific data to poison the cache, which matches certain criteria that are not publicly disclosed for security reasons.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Knot Resolver versions 2.4.0 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in Knot Resolver version 2.4.1.
*   The vulnerability is described as "Improper Input Validation" (CWE-20).
*   The vulnerability is not easily exploited using classical DNS spoofing techniques like the Kaminsky attack due to the resolver's randomization of ports, query IDs, and query name capitalization. This makes the requirement for an authoritative server essential for exploitation.
