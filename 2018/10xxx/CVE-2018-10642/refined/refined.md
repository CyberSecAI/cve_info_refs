{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `TestConfig()` function in the `config.php` file uses the `eval()` function on user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
        "Use of `eval()` on user-controlled input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious code into the platform configuration. This code uses `shell_exec` to create a backdoor. The backdoor then allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands by passing the commands via a `cmd` parameter in a GET request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrator privileges to modify the platform's configuration."
