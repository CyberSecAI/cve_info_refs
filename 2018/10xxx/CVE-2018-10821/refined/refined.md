The provided content relates to CVE-2018-10821.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the search panel of the BlackCatCMS application. The application directly includes user-provided input in the generated HTML without proper validation or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the search field. This malicious code is then executed by the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to:
  - Access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information stored in the browser.
  - Potentially rewrite the content of the HTML page, leading to further attacks like phishing.
  - Execute arbitrary actions within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the search panel of the application.
- An attacker crafts a malicious link containing the XSS payload in the search parameter.
- The victim is tricked into clicking the malicious link or submitting a crafted form.
- The web application reflects the malicious payload back to the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that contains the malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL or accessing a page that includes the malicious input. This could be done via email or other means.
- Attacker does not need to be an authenticated user. However, the exploitation was done in an admin session.
