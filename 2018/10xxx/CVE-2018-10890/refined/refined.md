Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `core_course_get_categories` web service in Moodle was returning hidden course categories when it should not have. This occurred when a user had permissions to manage categories but lacked permissions to view hidden categories, which should have resulted in them not being included in the results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability resulted in an information disclosure issue, where hidden categories could be exposed through the web service, even to users who should not have had visibility into them based on the intended permission model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Exposure of hidden course categories to users with category management rights but not explicitly permissioned to view hidden categories

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `core_course_get_categories` web service. An attacker would need to have permissions to manage categories within Moodle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user within Moodle with permissions to manage categories. However, they must *not* have explicit permission to view hidden categories. This specific permission gap enabled the unauthorized information disclosure.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue was reported by Marina Glancy.
*   The bug is tracked in Moodle's issue tracker as MDL-62790.
*   The vulnerability affected a wide range of Moodle versions: 3.5, 3.4 to 3.4.3, 3.3 to 3.3.6, 3.2 to 3.2.9, 3.1 to 3.1.12 and earlier unsupported versions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle versions 3.5.1, 3.4.4, 3.3.7, and 3.1.13.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla also tracks the issue as Bug 1599804, noting that it does not directly affect any commercially supported Red Hat product but is related to the open-source Moodle application.
