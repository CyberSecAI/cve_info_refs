The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EasyCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when posting or editing articles. Specifically, the title, keyword, abstract, and content fields are vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in multiple fields (title, keyword, abstract, content) of the article creation/editing functionality.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected fields.
- When a user views the compromised article, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Cookie theft and session hijacking
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacement of the website
  - Data exfiltration
  - Executing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the EasyCMS application. An authenticated user with the ability to create or edit articles is required.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code in the title, keyword, abstract, or content fields when posting an article through the administrator panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the privilege to create or edit articles in the EasyCMS admin panel.
- The attacker does not need any special network position, standard web access is enough.
