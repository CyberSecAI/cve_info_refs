{
  "CVE-2018-10675": {
    "description": "The do_get_mempolicy() function in mm/mempolicy.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to hit a use-after-free bug via crafted system calls and thus to cause a denial of service (DoS) or possibly have unspecified other impact. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free in the `do_get_mempolicy` function. This occurs because the function releases a lock prematurely while it can still be accessed later, leading to a race condition when another thread attempts to remove the memory policy.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS), and possibly gain unspecified other impacts, including potentially privilege escalation, due to the use-after-free.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "crafted system calls"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user access."
