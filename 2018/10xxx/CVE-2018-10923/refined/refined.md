  "CVE-2018-10923": {
    "description": "It was found that the \"mknod\" call derived from mknod(2) can create files pointing to devices on a glusterfs server node. An authenticated attacker could use this to create an arbitrary device and read data from any device attached to the glusterfs server node.",

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The ability to create device files allows reading arbitrary devices."
