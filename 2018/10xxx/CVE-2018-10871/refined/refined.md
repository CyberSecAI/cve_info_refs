Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-10871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The 389-ds-base Directory Server, when configured with the Replica and/or retroChangeLog plugins enabled, stored user passwords in plaintext within their respective changelog files. This was due to the `nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch` attribute being set to 'on' by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Password Storage:** Passwords were being stored in an unencrypted format in changelog files.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The `nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch` was enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with high privileges, such as root or Directory Manager, could access these changelog files and retrieve plaintext passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** Attackers need access to the file system where the changelog files are stored.
*   **Privileged Access Required:** Attackers would need root or Directory Manager level privileges to access the files directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Account:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges on the system where 389-ds-base is installed (e.g., root or Directory Manager).
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs access to the location of the changelog files.

**Mitigation:**

*   The `nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch` attribute should be set to 'off' or 'nolog' in the `cn=config` to prevent future passwords from being logged in plaintext.
*   Existing changelogs need to be trimmed or purged to remove previously logged plaintext passwords.
*   For replication, the following attributes should be adjusted, `nsslapd-changelogmaxentries`, `nsslapd-changelogtrim-interval` and `nsslapd-changelogmaxage`, followed by forcing replication and restoring the original values.
*   For RetroChangelog, the plugin should be deactivated and reactivated, followed by restarting the directory server, to ensure no plaintext password remains.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the `nsslapd-unhashed-pw-switch` attribute within 389-ds-base.
*   This issue affects 389-ds-base versions 1.3.1 and above.
*   Red Hat has released RHSA-2019:3401 as an update to address this vulnerability, along with CVE-2019-14824, CVE-2019-3883, and CVE-2019-10224.
