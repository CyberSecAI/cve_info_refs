## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3753-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```

The bg_flags field in the block group descripts is only valid if the
uninit_bg or metadata_csum feature is enabled.  We were not
consistently looking at this field; fix this.

Also block group #0 must never have uninitialized allocation bitmaps,
or need to be zeroed, since that's where the root inode, and other
special inodes are set up.  Check for these conditions and mark the
file system as corrupted if they are detected.

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Debian Bug     : 860900 872907 892057 896775 897590 898137

Linux 4.9 has been packaged for Debian 8 as linux-4.9.  This provides
a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use kernel
packages from the "jessie-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 3.16, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    hyperv-daemons libcpupower1 libcpupower-dev libusbip-dev
    linux-compiler-gcc-4.9-x86 linux-cpupower linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from other source packages
in Debian 8.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-18255

    It was discovered that the performance events subsystem did not
    properly validate the value of the
    kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent sysctl.  Setting a large value
    could have an unspecified security impact.  However, only a
    privileged user can set this sysctl.

CVE-2018-1118

    The syzbot software found that the vhost driver did not initialise
    message buffers which would later be read by user processes.  A
    user with access to the /dev/vhost-net device could use this to
    read sensitive information from the kernel or other users'
    processes.

CVE-2018-1120

    Qualys reported that a user able to mount FUSE filesystems can
    create a process such that when another process attempting to read
    its command line will be blocked for an arbitrarily long time.
    This could be used for denial of service, or to aid in exploiting
    a race condition in the other program.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3639

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context.  In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox.  This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update allows the issue to be mitigated on some x86
    processors by disabling SSB.  This requires an update to the
    processor's microcode, which is non-free.  It may be included in
    an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a future
    update to the intel-microcode or amd64-microcode packages.

    Disabling SSB can reduce performance significantly, so by default
    it is only done in tasks that use the seccomp feature.
    Applications that require this mitigation should request it
    explicitly through the prctl() system call.  Users can control
    where the mitigation is enabled with the spec_store_bypass_disable
    kernel parameter.

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-10021

    A physically present attacker who unplugs a SAS cable can cause a
    denial of service (memory leak and WARN).

CVE-2018-10087, CVE-2018-10124

    zhongjiang found that the wait4() and kill() system call
    implementations did not check for the invalid pid value of
    INT_MIN.  If a user passed this value, the behaviour of the code
    was formally undefined and might have had a security impact.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10876, CVE-2018-10877, CVE-2018-10878, CVE-2018-10879,
CVE-2018-10880, CVE-2018-10881, CVE-2018-10882, CVE-2018-10883

    Wen Xu at SSLab, Gatech, reported that crafted ext4 filesystem
    images could trigger a crash or memory corruption.  A local user
    able to mount arbitrary filesystems, or an attacker providing
    filesystems to be mounted, could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-1~deb8u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#860900, #872907, #892057, #896775, #897590, and #898137; and
includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.89-4.9.110
inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-hwe) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS-HWE) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

(I suspect the earlier UAF was fixed recent fix.)  As far as the latest UAF is concerned, this is triggered by the fact that allocation bitmaps are marked as uninitialized for block group #0.  Ext4 shouldn't have paid attention to these flags, since the prerequisite file system feature (uninit_bg or metadata_csum) was not set.  In addition, even if one of those two feature flags were set, ext4 should report an file system corruption if bitmaps for bg 0 are marked as uninitialized and refuse to try to clear those bitmaps, since nothing good can happen.  This will be fixed by the patch:      ext4: only look at the bg_flags field if it is valid          The bg_flags field in the block group descripts is only valid if the     uninit_bg or metadata_csum feature is enabled.  We were not     consistently looking at this field; fix this.          Also block group #0 must never have uninitialized allocation bitmaps,     or need to be zeroed, since that's where the root inode, and other     special inodes are set up.  Check for these conditions and mark the     file system as corrupted if they are detected. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=199403#c4)  Theodore Tso    2018-06-17 17:49:00 UTC  ``` Patchwork link: <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/929239/> ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=199403#c6)  Theodore Tso    2018-07-02 15:57:24 UTC  ```  This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-10876.

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

uninit\_bg or metadata\_csum feature is enabled. We were not
consistently looking at this field; fix this.
Also block group #0 must never have uninitialized allocation bitmaps,
or need to be zeroed, since that's where the root inode, and other
special inodes are set up. Check for these conditions and mark the
file system as corrupted if they are detected.
This addresses CVE-2018-10876.
