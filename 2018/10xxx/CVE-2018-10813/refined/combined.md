### @rastating **[rastating](/rastating)** commented [Jun 1, 2018](#issue-328483629)

**Description**

This pull request fixes a security issue by removing the hard coded cookie and session secrets. This change will instead make the application fetch them from the `DEDOS_WEB_COOKIE_SECRET` and `DEDOS_WEB_SESSION_SECRET` environment variables.

By using a hard coded secret, a would-be attacker could manipulate the cookie data and re-sign it using the same secret - potentially leading to an authentication bypass and privilege escalation.

**Vulnerability Classification**

CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password

CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data

**CVE-ID**

[CVE-2018-10813](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-10813/)

**CVSS v3 Score**

# Vulnerability Details : [CVE-2018-10813](/cve/CVE-2018-10813/ "CVE-2018-10813 security vulnerability details")

In Dedos-web 1.0, the cookie and session secrets used in the Express.js application have hardcoded values that are visible in the source code published on GitHub. An attacker can edit the contents of the session cookie and re-sign it using the hardcoded secret. Due to the use of Passport.js, this could lead to privilege escalation.
