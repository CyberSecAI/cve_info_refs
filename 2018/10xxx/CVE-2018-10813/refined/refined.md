Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded cookie and session secrets within the Dedos-web 1.0 application. These secrets were directly embedded in the source code, making them accessible to anyone with access to the codebase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded secrets for cookie and session management, instead of retrieving them from a secure location, such as environment variables.
- **CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password**: The application uses hard coded values for cryptographic keys.
- **CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data:** Because the secrets are hardcoded, an attacker can use them to manipulate session cookies and potentially bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can craft or modify session cookies and resign them using the hardcoded secret. This could allow them to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing authentication, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the application, granting them access to sensitive data and/or administrative functions.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on availability. However, the possibility of privilege escalation could lead to a more significant impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, as the session cookies are exchanged over network connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Source Code:** An attacker needs to have access to the application's source code to extract the hardcoded secrets. This could be through access to the GitHub repository or by other means of obtaining the code.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application to manipulate session cookies.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub content includes a pull request that addresses this issue by removing the hardcoded secrets and instead fetching them from environment variables (`DEDOS_WEB_COOKIE_SECRET` and `DEDOS_WEB_SESSION_SECRET`).
- The vulnerability was found in version 1.0 of Dedos-web.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.5 (Medium) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, as specified in the GitHub content. The CVSS v3 score from cvedetails.com is 7.3 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
- The CVSS v2 score is 7.5 (High) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
