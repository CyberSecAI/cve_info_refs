The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded administrator password within the `api/schema.sql` file of Directus version 6.4.9. The `INSERT` statement in this file includes a pre-defined password hash for the default "admin" user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The application uses a hardcoded password hash for the administrative user, making it trivial for an attacker to gain access by using a password "admin".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privileges:** Successful exploitation leads to full administrative access to the Directus platform, allowing the attacker to perform any action that an administrator is authorized to do.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by anyone who can access the login page of a vulnerable Directus instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of a Directus installation running version 6.4.9. They must also know the hardcoded username ("admin") and password, which is easy to find since it's public information related to this CVE.
