Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Metadata" fields when editing a page within the FrogCMS admin panel. Specifically, the `keywords` field does not sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the database through the vulnerable `keywords` field. This code is then executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts, including admin accounts.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data from the victim's browser or the web application.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the web page.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the FrogCMS administration panel.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript through a POST request to edit a page's metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the FrogCMS to be able to edit a page and its metadata.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `keywords` field is vulnerable to XSS.

**Technical Details:**

1.  The attacker logs into the FrogCMS admin panel.
2.  They navigate to the page editing section (pages-->Edit Page-->Metadata).
3.  They insert a malicious JavaScript payload into the `keywords` field. Example: `"/><script>confirm(1234)</script>` or `"/><script>confirm(document.cookie)</script>`
4.  They save the page.
5.  When a user visits the page, the injected JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
