### @Mark-H **[Mark-H](/Mark-H)** commented [May 1, 2018](#issue-319343513)

### What does it do?

Applies htmlspecialchars to some processors which were exposing 3 stored XSS issues.

### Why is it needed?

Tighten security a bit.

None of these XSS issues should have any far-reaching consequences. They all require manager access for starters. Also

* The one in the recently edited dashboard widget would only be useful to XSS yourself, as the resource list only shows resources you personally edited. Perhaps a problem when sharing user accounts.
* Access to edit the top menu (actions) is needed for number 2. That's an advanced permission that only full admins should have.
* Adding/editing setting permission is needed for number 3. Also, that should already be limited to full admin users.

### Related issue(s)/PR(s)

Security inbox ticket number 69. Reported by Aman Sahey on April 25th.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I concur with [@Jako](https://github.com/Jako) in that you should be using `$modx->getOption('modx_charset', $options, 'UTF-8')` rather than hardcoding UTF-8.
