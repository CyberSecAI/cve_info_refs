The content is related to CVE-2018-10382.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data before displaying it in the MODX Revolution management interface, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified vulnerabilities are Stored XSS issues in three different locations:
1.  The recently edited dashboard widget.
2.  The top menu (actions) editor.
3.  The system settings editor.
These vulnerabilities stem from the fact that data being displayed in the manager interface was not being encoded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the vulnerable parts of the MODX Revolution management interface.
This could allow the attacker to perform a variety of actions, including but not limited to:
*   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (if an admin)
*   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
*   Modifying the content displayed in the manager.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the MODX Revolution management interface. An attacker with manager access can inject malicious scripts via the vulnerable areas (dashboard widget, top menu and system settings)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have manager access to the MODX Revolution instance, which has different levels of permissions based on the location of the XSS vector:
*   The XSS in the recently edited dashboard widget could be exploited by an account that has the ability to edit resources.
*   The top menu (actions) XSS requires the "edit actions" permission, which is usually restricted to full admins.
*   The settings XSS requires the permission to add or edit settings, usually limited to full admin users.
