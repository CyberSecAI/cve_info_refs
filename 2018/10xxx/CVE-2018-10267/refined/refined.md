The provided content describes a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability found in the wtcms project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, specifically in the `admin/user/add_post` endpoint. This means a malicious actor can cause an authenticated administrator to perform unwanted actions.
*   **Lack of CSRF token:** The provided HTML exploit code demonstrates that the application is missing proper CSRF protection mechanisms, such as CSRF tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can add a new administrator account by forging a request to `/index.php?g=admin&m=user&a=add_post` with predefined credentials. This new administrator account can then be used to fully compromise the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker would likely need to trick the administrator into visiting a malicious webpage containing the CSRF exploit.
*   **Malicious webpage:** The attacker hosts the provided HTML code on a site they control. When the administrator opens this page while logged into the application, the form automatically submits a request to add a new admin user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable endpoint (`/index.php?g=admin&m=user&a=add_post`).
*   The attacker needs to craft a valid POST request containing the parameters needed to create a new administrator account (`user_login`, `user_pass`, `user_email`, `role_id[]`).
*   The attacker needs to host the exploit on a webpage the administrator might visit while logged into the application, or otherwise find a way to make the user open the exploit.
*  The attacker needs the administrator to be logged in to the targeted application during the exploit.
