# CVE-2018-10756: Transmission

by Tom Richards

Thursday, May 14, 2020

[CVE-2018-10756](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10756): Transmission can crash or possibly execute arbitrary code when opening a maliciously crafted torrent file.

Any application which uses `libtransmission`, such as `transmission-daemon`, `transmission-gtk`, `transmission-show`, etc. is susceptible to this problem.

The official CVE text is as follows:

> Use-after-free in libtransmission/variant.c in Transmission before 3.00 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted torrent file.

It is a [well known fact](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) that use-after-free errors can, at worst, be leveraged into execution of arbitrary code.

## Reasons to look for security bugs

1. Selfish reasons. Transmission is my favorite torrent client and I wanted to see if I could break it.
2. Trust, but verify. I trust that my torrent client is built with security in mind, but I wanted to verify this for myself.
3. Many people exist in this universe who are smarter than me. If I can break Transmission, chances are, somebody else can break it too. Maybe they can get it to run nasty code on my machine!

By performing this kind of research, I hope that I can…

* Help make the Transmission project more secure and more stable
* Use smart fuzzing tools
* Learn some interesting things along the way

Security bugs often begin with a program crash. So let’s get to it!

## How to discover a crash

The way to make a program crash is to simply throw a fuzzer at it for a while. For this particular bug, I happened to use [afl-fuzz](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) because (a) it was the first fuzzer I tried, and (b) it was easy to use. I didn’t need to write any additional code; I just needed to build the existing `transmission-show` utility using the AFL compiler.

First, I built `transmission-show` with AFL.

```
# Instrument builds with afl-fuzz
export CFLAGS="-O0 -g"
export CC=afl-clang-fast
export CXX=afl-clang-fast++
# Build transmission-show utility
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make transmission-show

```

I then collected 6 of the smallest torrents I could find from [academictorrents.com](http://academictorrents.com/) and used them as my starting corpus.

```
$ ls -1 testcase_dir/
07e05fc1229555e124df72160a01b2540d04cebf.torrent
25932ba42d983dd7b4474d8f59ab56cdc25d9107.torrent
3efc53f35d49669b89039f2b4ec9de11ec1d73fd.torrent
551952d08103200cf5034fb74adf71643aa0c643.torrent
968a3ff5e4182cdecd239980ecfd257a37451003.torrent
ba43f388cb372f72a91d7c08c54a3f8b36fe3505.torrent

```

When running the fuzzer, I made it utilize all CPU cores by launching multiple processes. Launch the parent fuzzer with the `-M` flag, and subsequent worker processes with the `-S` flag.

```
# Parent process (00)
afl-fuzz -m 128M -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir -M fuzzer00 -- ./utils/transmission-show @@
# Worker processes (01 - ...?)
afl-fuzz -m 128M -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir -S fuzzer01 -- ./utils/transmission-show @@
afl-fuzz -m 128M -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir -S fuzzer02 -- ./utils/transmission-show @@

```

After running for a number of hours, `afl-fuzz` produced a few dozen duplicate crash cases in the form of just-corrupt-enough `.torrent` files.

```
$ ls -1 findings_dir/

...

```

Running `transmission-show` against these generated input files produced a few interesting crashes.

#### 1. Null pointer dereference in `utils/show.c`

The `transmission-show` utility did not check the return value of `localtime`.

#### utils/show.c

| ``` [111](#localtime-111) [112](#localtime-112) [113](#localtime-113) [114](#localtime-114) [115](#localtime-115) [116](#localtime-116) [117](#localtime-117) [118](#localtime-118) [119](#localtime-119)  ``` | ``` if (inf->dateCreated == 0) {     printf("  Created on: Unknown\n"); } else {     struct tm tm = *localtime(&inf->dateCreated);     printf("  Created on: %s", asctime(&tm)); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

When `localtime` fails to parse the date due to mangled or invalid data (as was the case with the fuzzer’s generated crash cases), it returns `NULL`. Dereferencing this `NULL` value is known as a [null pointer dereference](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html).

This issue only affected the `transmission-show` utility and was [patched](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/commit/8a67a8cb5da5c5c61104dfacad73891cbc90220f) a while ago.

#### 2. Assert / abort in `libtransmission/ptrarray.h`

Running `transmission-show` against some generated crash cases resulted in a failed assertion, ultimately causing the program to `abort()`.

```
$ ./transmission-show 'id:000000,sig:06,src:001779+001066,op:splice,rep:16'
assertion failed: i >= 0 (/home/tom/transmission/libtransmission/ptrarray.h:53)
Aborted (core dumped)

```

Transmission’s array accessor function begins with a number of assertions which try to prevent bad things from happening. Fortunately for us, `afl-fuzz` is smart enough to get around them, as we’ll see in a moment.

| ``` [48](#ptrarray-48) [49](#ptrarray-49) [50](#ptrarray-50) [51](#ptrarray-51) [52](#ptrarray-52) [53](#ptrarray-53) [54](#ptrarray-54) [55](#ptrarray-55) [56](#ptrarray-56) [57](#ptrarray-57)  ``` | ``` /** @brief Return the nth item in a tr_ptrArray     @return the nth item in a tr_ptrArray */ static inline void* tr_ptrArrayNth(tr_ptrArray* array, int i) {     TR_ASSERT(array != NULL);     TR_ASSERT(i >= 0);     TR_ASSERT(i < array->n_items);     return array->items[i]; } ``` |
| --- | --- |

I chose not to investigate these `abort()` cases, because they’re really just a sign that something more interesting is happening.

#### 3. Segfault in `libtransmission/variant.c`

Running `transmission-show` against some generated crash cases resulted in a segmentation fault:

```
$ ./transmission-show 'id:000009,sig:11,src:001800,op:havoc,rep:8'
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

Now this looks promising! The segmentation fault is a sign of bad memory behavior. The next steps are to (a) determine what kind of bad behavior it is, and (b) understand why the behavior occurs.

## Minimizing the crash cases

In the collected crash cases directory, I found that `afl-fuzz` had generated torrent files which are over 30KB in size! This is way too much data to step through by hand. Fortunately, there were some smaller crash cases as well.

I settled on a handful of crashes which all basically crashed the same way with a segfault, and selected the one with the smallest filesize. To further simplify this crash input file, we hand it over to `afl-tmin`, the automatic test case minimizer.

`afl-tmin` performs a few optimization passes in an attempt to remove unimportant bytes of data from the input file.

The command-line invocation looks like this:

```
$ afl-tmin -m 128M -i crashes/segfault.torrent -o minimized-crash.torrent -- ./transmission-show @@
afl-tmin 2.52b by <lcamtuf@google.com>
[+] Read 662 bytes from 'crashes/segfault.torrent'.

          Fruitless execs : path=1256 crash=0 hang=0

[+] We're done here. Have a nice day!

```

In stage 1, it somehow figured out how to remove blocks while balancing the start/end bencoding markers. Pretty impressive!

In stage 2, the minimizer changes unique symbols into one or more duplicate symbols. In our bencoded torrent file, the minimizer ended up homogenizing the dictionary keys to all be `"0"`.

```
# Before minimization:
{ "a": { "b": { "c": ... } } }
# After minimization:
{ "0": { "0": { "0": ... } } }

```

Overall result: Not bad! The minimizer automatically reduced the crash case input by almost half (662 bytes -> 352 bytes).

## Verifying the use-after-free with ASan

[AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html), or “ASan”, is a memory error detection feature of the Clang compiler. When compiling your program with ASan, Clang instruments your compiled binary with special instructions to help detect incorrect memory usage.

ASan will terminate your program with a big fancy error message if your program…

* Makes an out-of-bounds access to the heap, stack, and/or globals,
* Attempts to use a memory address after it was `free()`d, or,
* Does other weird things as listed on the [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) page.

### Building transmission with ASan

```
# Instrument builds with AddressSanitizer
export CC="clang"
export CXX="clang++"
export CFLAGS="-O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -pthread"
export LDFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address"
# Build transmission-show utility
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make transmission-show

```

Here’s what `transmission-show` looks like when crashing under ASan:

```
# Run asan-enabled program against the generated crash case
$ ./transmission-show crashes/segfault.torrent

```

During the `torrentParseImpl` process, AddressSanitizer shows us that some memory is first allocated with `malloc`, then freed with `realloc`, and finally accessed again. This is bad news. So why does this happen?

## Understanding bencoding

[Bencoding](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html) is a the format which is used to encode torrent files. It provides an efficient, dictionary-like storage mechanism which allows for fast, endian-neutral decoding, as well as storage of binary data.

Bencoding resembles JSON, but bencoding was specified and implemented at a time before JSON became widely popular.

Decoding (or “interpreting”) a bencode object can be implemented naively in a recursive fashion:

```
# Decodes a single bencode object
function decode_next_object() {
  do {
    char := read_character()
    if char == 'd' # Dictionary start
      allocate_dictionary()
      decode_next_object()
    else if char == 'l' # List start
      allocate_list()
      decode_next_object()
    else if char == 'i' # Number start
      decode_number()
    else if char in ('1'..'9') # Strings start with length
      decode_string()
    else
      exit("invalid input")
  } (while char != null)
}

```

With this recursive algorithm, a problem appears when dealing with arbitrarily-deeply nested objects. Since a piece of bencoded data can have dictionaries wrapped in lists wrapped in dictionaries and so on, pushing a function call onto the stack for each level of data nesting is just asking for trouble. C developers should be especially careful about interpreting untrusted input using an unbounded recursive algorithm.

Transmission used to use a recursive implementation for walking a bencoding object. It was vulnerable to a “smash-stacking” (sic) attack, however, and was [changed](https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/667).

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [813](#smash-813) [814](#smash-814) [815](#smash-815) [816](#smash-816) [817](#smash-817) [818](#smash-818)  ``` | ``` /**  * This function's previous recursive implementation was  * easier to read, but was vulnerable to a smash-stacking  * attack via maliciously-crafted data. (#667)  */ void tr_variantWalk(tr_variant const* v, struct VariantWalkFuncs const* walkFuncs, void* user_data, bool sort_dicts) ``` |
| --- | --- |

## How do we defend against this?

Transmission is written in C. Some defenses against stack overflow in this language are:

#### 1. Add a nesting limit.

Choose an arbitrary recursion limit (let’s say, `1000`) for your decoder. The nesting limit of the object will be limited to 1000 levels deep. Upon reaching the limit, you may choose to ignore deeper values, or simply reject the input as invalid altogether.

#### 2. Don’t use recursion.

Use an iterative algorithm where the decoding state is not stored on the stack. For example, such a decoder might allocate its own “stack” on the heap, to keep track of where it is in the decoding process. This eliminates the potential for stack overflow, albeit with the new possibility of memory consumption. :) Again, creating an artificial nesting limit can help eliminate this unbounded memory growth.

Transmission’s current decoder does allocate its own decoding stack, and handles resizing the stack when it becomes full. As far as I’m aware, it does not have a nesting limit.

## Understanding why the program crashes

When opening a `.torrent` file, Transmission performs the following actions to decode the data in it:

Step 1: Pre-allocate a stack of 64 elements.

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [820](#alloc-820) [821](#alloc-821) [822](#alloc-822)  ``` | ``` int stackSize = 0; int stackAlloc = 64; struct SaveNode* stack = tr_new(struct SaveNode, stackAlloc); ``` |
| --- | --- |

Step 2: Walk the bencode tree, pushing `SaveNode`s onto the decoding stack when encountering “container” types such as lists and dictionaries.

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [882](#walk-882) [883](#walk-883) [884](#walk-884) [885](#walk-885) [886](#walk-886) [887](#walk-887) [888](#walk-888) [889](#walk-889) [890](#walk-890) [891](#walk-891) [892](#walk-892) [893](#walk-893) [894](#walk-894) [895](#walk-895) [896](#walk-896) [897](#walk-897) [898](#walk-898)  ``` | ``` case TR_VARIANT_TYPE_LIST:     if (v == node->v)     {         walkFuncs->listBeginFunc(v, user_data);     }     else     {         if (stackAlloc == stackSize)         {             stackAlloc *= 2;             stack = tr_renew(struct SaveNode, stack, stackAlloc);         }         nodeConstruct(&stack[stackSize++], v, sort_dicts);     }     break; ``` |
| --- | --- |

Step 3: When the stack fills up, double its size by using `tr_renew`, a custom `realloc` wrapper.

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [882](#renew-882) [883](#renew-883) [884](#renew-884) [885](#renew-885) [886](#renew-886) [887](#renew-887) [888](#renew-888) [889](#renew-889) [890](#renew-890) [891](#renew-891) [892](#renew-892) [893](#renew-893) [894](#renew-894) [895](#renew-895) [896](#renew-896) [897](#renew-897) [898](#renew-898)  ``` | ``` case TR_VARIANT_TYPE_LIST:     if (v == node->v)     {         walkFuncs->listBeginFunc(v, user_data);     }     else     {         if (stackAlloc == stackSize)         {             stackAlloc *= 2;             stack = tr_renew(struct SaveNode, stack, stackAlloc);         }         nodeConstruct(&stack[stackSize++], v, sort_dicts);     }     break; ``` |
| --- | --- |

Step 4: While constructing the `SaveNode`, a pointer to the current stack is attached to the node (oops!). Can you spot the bug?

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [766](#oops-766) [767](#oops-767) [768](#oops-768) [769](#oops-769) [770](#oops-770) [771](#oops-771) [772](#oops-772) [773](#oops-773) [774](#oops-774) [775](#oops-775) [776](#oops-776) [777](#oops-777) [778](#oops-778) [779](#oops-779) [780](#oops-780) [781](#oops-781) [782](#oops-782) [783](#oops-783) [784](#oops-784) [785](#oops-785) [786](#oops-786) [787](#oops-787) [788](#oops-788) [789](#oops-789) [790](#oops-790) [791](#oops-791) [792](#oops-792) [793](#oops-793) [794](#oops-794) [795](#oops-795) [796](#oops-796) [797](#oops-797) [798](#oops-798) [799](#oops-799) [800](#oops-800) [801](#oops-801) [802](#oops-802) [803](#oops-803)  ``` | ``` static void nodeConstruct(struct SaveNode* node, tr_variant const* v, bool sort_dicts) {     node->isVisited = false;     node->childIndex = 0;     if (sort_dicts && tr_variantIsDict(v))     {         /* make node->sorted a sorted version of this dictionary */         size_t const n = v->val.l.count;         struct KeyIndex* tmp = tr_new(struct KeyIndex, n);         for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)         {             tmp[i].val = v->val.l.vals + i;             tmp[i].keystr = tr_quark_get_string(tmp[i].val->key, NULL);         }         qsort(tmp, n, sizeof(struct KeyIndex), compareKeyIndex);         tr_variantInitDict(&node->sorted, n);         for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i)         {             node->sorted.val.l.vals[i] = *tmp[i].val;         }         node->sorted.val.l.count = n;         tr_free(tmp);         node->v = &node->sorted;     }     else     {         node->v = v;     } } ``` |
| --- | --- |

Because the stack was reallocated, the `SaveNode`’s variant pointer `v` points to the previously allocated (now freed!) memory.

Step 5: To finish decoding, walk back down the stack, passing `v` to a few different functions such as `tr_variantIsContainer`.

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [826](#down-826) [827](#down-827) [828](#down-828) [829](#down-829) [830](#down-830) [831](#down-831) [832](#down-832) [833](#down-833) [834](#down-834) [835](#down-835) [836](#down-836) [837](#down-837) [838](#down-838) [839](#down-839)  ``` | ``` while (stackSize > 0) {     struct SaveNode* node = &stack[stackSize - 1];     tr_variant const* v;     if (!node->isVisited)     {         v = node->v;         node->isVisited = true;     }     else if (tr_variantIsContainer(node->v) && node->childIndex < node->v->val.l.count)     {         int const index = node->childIndex;         ++node->childIndex; ``` |
| --- | --- |

One more level…

#### libtransmission/variant.c

| ``` [112](#container-112) [113](#container-113) [114](#container-114) [115](#container-115)  ``` | ``` static bool tr_variantIsContainer(tr_variant const* v) {     return tr_variantIsList(v) || tr_variantIsDict(v); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

Before finally landing at a line of code which dereferences the pointer.

#### libtransmission/variant.h

| ``` [213](#deref-213) [214](#deref-214) [215](#deref-215) [216](#deref-216)  ``` | ``` static inline bool tr_variantIsList(tr_variant const* v) {     return v != NULL && v->type == TR_VARIANT_TYPE_LIST; } ``` |
| --- | --- |

Oops! `v->type` dereferences the pointer. It points to the previous stack (in a freed region of memory), causing a crash (use-after-free).

## Why did the patch take so long?

Transmission is an open source project run by a handful of kind volunteers in their spare time.

* Could I have demanded that the maintainers *immediately* release a new version to address this issue? Yes.
* Would it have been a huge jerk move to demand other people’s time like that? Also yes.

Admittedly, two years from report to release is a *just a tiny bit* longer than I was expecting. Maybe next time I’ll explicitly set a 90-day deadline.

## Improving the project for the future

More fuzzing with a good set of test corpora can help identify problems like this. Ideal future fuzz targets might include code which uses untrusted data and/or network client(s) that touch the public internet, such as:

* Announcer (HTTP/UDP)
* Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
* Magnet URI parsing
* Micro Transport Protocol (uTP) client
* Torrent file parsing
* UDP client
* Webseed fetcher

## How to mitigate this issue

1. [Update Transmission to 3.00](https://transmissionbt.com/download/).
2. If you can’t update for some reason, avoid using `.torrent` files, especially untrusted ones. Instead, initiate your downloads via magnet link.

## Exercises left to the reader :)

* What is the smallest possible amount of input data (bytes) required to reproduce this crash?
* Leverage the crash into arbitrary code execution.

[CVE-2018-10756](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7mv4-3q74-r9q2 "CVE-2018-10756"): Fix heap-use-after-free in tr\_variantWalk

```
In libtransmission/variant.c, function tr_variantWalk, when the variant
stack is reallocated, a pointer to the previously allocated memory
region is kept. This address is later accessed (heap use-after-free)
while walking back down the stack, causing the application to crash.
The application can be any application which uses libtransmission, such
as transmission-daemon, transmission-gtk, transmission-show, etc.

[CVE-2018-10756](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7mv4-3q74-r9q2 "CVE-2018-10756"): Fix heap-use-after-free in tr\_variantWalk

```
In libtransmission/variant.c, function tr_variantWalk, when the variant
stack is reallocated, a pointer to the previously allocated memory
region is kept. This address is later accessed (heap use-after-free)
while walking back down the stack, causing the application to crash.
The application can be any application which uses libtransmission, such
as transmission-daemon, transmission-gtk, transmission-show, etc.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

# Transmission: Remote code execution — GLSA **202007-07**

A use-after-free possibly allowing remote execution of code was
discovered in Transmission.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-p2p/transmission** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.00** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.00** |

### Background

Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client.

### Description

Transmission mishandles some memory management which may allow
manipulation of the heap.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
torrent file using Transmission, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Transmission users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/transmission-3.00"

```
