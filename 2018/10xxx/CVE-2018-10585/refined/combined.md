## Pexip Infinity v36 new features and enhancements

### Pexip Infinity platform

| Feature | Description | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout improvements | There are several minor improvements to how some layout features are displayed:   * The text-based in-conference messages that are temporarily shown at the top of the layout (which indicate states such as a locked conference, live captions, recording/streaming/transcribing/AI enabled, raised hands, and audio-only participant names when speaking), have been restyled. By default they are now shown in white text on various different background colors. For example:                 The text and background colors can be customized via a new indicator\_color\_config setting in the theme configuration file. * There is a new "AI" indicator, shown when Google Meet AI features are enabled. * Any content classification messages are now shown in an overlay banner at the top of the layout. If a banner message is also being displayed then they are combined into the same overlay. | [Conference layouts and speaker names](changing_layout.htm)  [Theme configuration file (themeconfig.json)](themes_file_requirements.htm#themeconfig) |
| Theme improvements: raise hand DTMF command, new supported fonts, new AI files | There are several improvements and updates to themes and splash screens:   * There is a new **dtmf\_conference\_control\_command** in the base theme: **toggle\_raise\_hand**, which is assigned to \*3 by default, and toggles the raised hand status of the participant in a VMR. * There are two new supported fonts for overlay text: "Inter" and "Inter Medium". * In support of the new AI indicator for Google Meet, there are:    + New audio files: **conf-ai\_started\_48kHz\_mono.wav** and **conf-ai\_stopped\_48kHz\_mono.wav**.   + New fields in the themeconfig.json file: **"disable\_ai\_indicator"** and **"ai\_indicator\_text"**. | [Rules and requirements for customized themes](themes_file_requirements.htm)  [Using a DTMF keypad to control a conference](dtmf_controls.htm) |
| Teams Connector enhancements: improved Teams Rooms interoperability, updated in-lobby notification messages | Pexip's Cloud Video Interop (CVI) integration with Microsoft Teams has been enhanced:   * Improved interoperability with Microsoft Teams Rooms:    + Connect app Hosts can now admit a Teams Room into a locked Pexip conference.   + Dual-screen Teams Rooms are now automatically detected and will display conference participants across both screens when joining a Pexip Infinity VMR, providing it uses the Teams Room calendaring service\* when using "Cross-platform meetings via SIP join for Teams Rooms". to join the conference. Local or external policy can also be used to provide similar behavior (by modifying the dialed alias) when calling into a Zoom meeting.   + Improved support for sending DTMF commands from a Teams Room into a Pexip conference. This includes toggling receiving presentation content in the layout mix (\*4), and toggling multiscreen participant display (\*9). * Any in-lobby notification messages are now displayed at the top of the screen. Previously they were displayed as slide out indicators. The displayed message is still generated from the conference\_locked\_indicator\_n\_waiting\_text theme configuration setting, but the conference\_locked\_indicator\_text and conference\_unlocked\_indicator\_text settings are no longer used in this context. * We now recommend assigning \*2 to the DTMF command for toggle\_teams\_large\_gallery in any customized theme for Teams integration. This is because \*3 was previously recommended but this digit is now assigned by default to toggle\_raise\_hand (which is not currently supported in Teams meetings).   Note that version 36 of the Teams Connector contains updates that necessitate an upgrade to your Pexip platform to ensure compatibility with the latest updates to the Microsoft Teams APIs and to the Teams Connector's latest features. We strongly recommend that you upgrade your Pexip deployment â both the Pexip Infinity platform and the Pexip Teams Connector â to version 36 as soon as practicable. | [Integrating Microsoft Teams with Pexip Infinity](teams_intro.htm)  [Upgrading the Teams Connector to the latest software](teams_managing.htm#upgrading)  [Configuring Pexip Infinity as a Microsoft Teams gateway](teams_configuration.htm) |
| Breakout rooms now a fully supported feature | Breakout rooms, which are separate sessions that are split off from a main VMR or Virtual Auditorium that allow smaller groups of people to meet together, is now a fully supported feature. Updates in this release include:   * The ability to customize the length of time the transfer modal is shown to Webapp3 users being [moved to or from a breakout room](breakout_rooms.htm#moving). * Updates to workflow and dialogs in the breakout rooms panel when managing rooms via the web app. | [Breakout rooms](breakout_rooms.htm)  [transferTimeout](customize_webapp_advanced.htm#transferTimeout) |
| Participant pinning now a fully supported feature | Participant pinning, which allows you to place and lock specific participants in the most prominent positions in a layout when a conference is in progress, is now a fully supported feature. | [Pinning participants to the layout during a conference](participant_pinning.htm) |
| OIDC: ability to request additional scopes | When configuring participant authentication for VMRs using an Open ID Connect Identity Provider, administrators can now request additional information using scopes. | [Additional OpenID Connect scopes](idps.htm#oidc_scopes) |
| Codec selection when configuring Call Routing Rules | When configuring Call Routing Rules you can now specify, per rule, which codecs to offer in audio/video negotiation (SDPs). | [Configuring Call Routing Rules](configuring_gateway_rules.htm) |
| Safe Links support | Support for Safe Links URL rewriting:   * One-Touch Join now supports meeting invitations that include URLs rewritten by Safe Links in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. * There is a new custom jinja filter, pex\_safelinks\_decode, which can be used to decode strings that have been encoded by Safe Links. | [Custom Pexip filters](jinja_templates.htm#custom_filters) |
| Policy enhancements: disable overlay text in participant policy; send DTMF in gateway calls; Teams Rooms OTJ call information; live captions support; registration requests support for SSO | Local and external policy has the following additions:   * In participant policy you can control whether a participant's overlay text (display name) is disabled. * You can specify a DTMF sequence to send in a Infinity Gateway service type response. * When a Microsoft Teams Room joins a call via One-Touch Join the following fields are now included in service configuration requests (external policy) and call information (local policy):    + display\_count: the number of screens signaled by the Teams Room.   + third\_party\_passcode: the passcode field provided by the Teams Rooms calendaring service\* when using "Cross-platform meetings via SIP join for Teams Rooms".. * You can specify the live captions source (audio) language and captions language. * External policy registration alias requests include support for single sign-on (SSO). Requests now include the remote\_address field, plus a new policy request field of auth\_type which can be either "credentials" or "sso". | [Requests and responses when using the Pexip Infinity external policy API](external_policy_requests.htm) |
| Pop-up-free authentication | Administrators can now opt to remove the use of pop-up windows for Webapp3 participants when authenticating using SSO in order to join a meeting. There are two new options in the Administrator interface associated with this feature:   * Disable pop-up windows (Users & Devices > Identity Providers > Add Identity provider) enables and disables this feature. * External Webapp Host address (Web App > External Web App Hosts) is required if you have disabled pop-ups and you either [host the web app externally](webapp_hosting.htm), or access the web app from a URL that is not a Conferencing Node's Configured FQDN. | [About pop-up windows](idps.htm#pop-up)  [Adding external hosts to Pexip Infinity](webapp_hosting.htm#add_host) |
| Administrative improvements: registration history, time-based media stream graphs, snapshot generation, packet captures | This release contains the following administrative improvements: |  |
| * You can now view a history of registered devices via History & Logs > Registration History. * In Status > Participants:   + A new field Is locally muted has been added which indicates whether the participant is muted locally on the client side.   + The On Hold field has been removed (from the Administrator interface only â it is still available via the Management Status API). * When generating a diagnostic snapshot you can now navigate away from the page while the file is being generated and then download it later when the process has completed. * When performing a packet capture you can now filter it on IP address / subnet and you have more flexibility in selecting the type of traffic captured. | [Viewing current and historic registrations](viewing_registrations.htm)  [Viewing participant status](view_participant_status.htm)  [Downloading a diagnostic snapshot](diagnostic_snapshot.htm)  [Performing a network packet capture](packet_capture.htm) |

### Connect web apps

#### Webapp3 v36.1

| Feature | Description | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New features | | |
| Camera off when joining  Mute microphone when joining | Users can now choose to have their camera and/or microphone turned off by default when joining meetings. There are two new options in Additional settings: Camera off when joining and Mute microphone when joining.  These controls will override **<muteMicrophone>** and **<muteCamera>** parameters in pre-configured links for launching conferences. If these parameters are set to false, the user configuration for Camera off when joining and Mute microphone when joining will take priority.  Admins can configure the initial state of the toggles via [advanced customization](customize_webapp_advanced.htm), using **enforceAudioMute** and **enforceVideoMute**.  If these flags are set to true the settings will be enabled by default for each user until they are deactivated in Additional settings. | [Using the web app](../clients/using_webapp.htm#configuring)  [Advanced web app customization](customize_webapp_advanced.htm)  [Pre-configured links to launch conferences](../clients/infinity_connect_url.htm) |
| Changes in functionality | | |
| Large conference improvements | Improvements to Webapp3's performance during conferences with a large number of participants. |  |

#### Webapp3 v36

| --- | --- | --- |
| New features | | |
| Pop-up-free authentication | Administrators can now opt to remove the use of pop-up windows for Webapp3 participants when authenticating using SSO in order to join a meeting. | [About pop-up windows](idps.htm#pop-up) |
| Participant authentication indicator | Webapp3 users can enable an option that indicates to them which participants were required to authenticate using SSO in order to join the meeting. | [Show authenticated participants](../clients/using_webapp.htm#authenticated) |
| Option to disable keyboard shortcuts | Users can now disable keyboard shortcuts to avoid potential conflicts with screen readers. The default setting for this option is configurable via customization. | [Disable app shortcuts](../clients/using_webapp.htm#disable_shortcuts)  Customization option: [disableKeyboardShortcuts](customize_webapp_advanced.htm#disableKeyboardShortcuts) |
| Changes in functionality | | |
| Mute sync improvements | * Mute indicators now show whether participants muted themselves or were muted by a Host. * Hosts can decide whether Guests who have been muted by a Host can unmute themselves. * Guests who have been muted by a Host are warned when they are later unmuted by a Host, and must choose whether or not to stay muted. | [Muting a participant's audio](muting_participant.htm)  [Prevent guests from unmuting](../clients/using_webapp.htm#no_unmute)  [View a participant's status](../clients/using_webapp.htm#role) |
| Participants panel improvements | * Meeting-wide controls (such as muting all guests and ending the meeting) are now under the participants panel Settings menu. * Participant-specific controls that were adjacent to participant names (such as muting and disconnecting) are now under the options menu for each participant. Icons next to participant names are now indicators rather than controls. | [Participants panel](../clients/using_webapp.htm#participants) |
| Chat panel improvements | * Information about participants joining and leaving the conference is now shown in the chat panel. * When writing messages, pressing Shift+Enter on the keyboard enters a new line. | [View information about participants joining and leaving the meeting](../clients/using_webapp.htm#chat_info)  [Send and receive chat messages, and share links](../clients/using_webapp.htm#chat) |

## Pexip Infinity v36 changes in functionality

| Feature | Description | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduling: minimum suffix length | When configuring single-use VMRs as part of the VMR Scheduling for Exchange feature, the minimum suffix length is now 5 digits rather than 6. If you are using a short suffix you must ensure that this is appropriate to the planned usage in your deployment, both for security purposes and to ensure you have a large enough pool of aliases. | [Management Node generates aliases and join instructions](scheduling_single-use.htm#generate_alias) |
| Epic Telehealth JWK Set URL (JKU) | Pexip Infinity now includes support for JWK Set URL (JKU), which may be required in a future release of Epic.  If your planned upgrade to Epic means your organization will be impacted, you should upgrade to v36 or later and then work with your Epic support representative to make the required changes on the Epic side, quoting Epic reference SLG 8598020. | [Outline of the integration process](telehealth_intro.htm#outline) |

## Planned changes in future releases

| Feature | Description | More information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use of application impersonation in One-Touch Join and VMR Scheduling for Exchange | From **February 2025** Microsoft will disable Application Impersonation role assignments to service accounts (for more information, see [Microsoft's announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/critical-update-applicationimpersonation-rbac-role-deprecation-in-exchange-onlin/4295762)). Therefore we strongly recommend that as soon as possible:   * **One-Touch Join** customers using O365 with an OTJ Exchange Integration should migrate to using Graph API instead. For full instructions, see [Migrating from EWS API to Graph API for One-Touch Join](otj_o365_ews_to_graph.htm). * **VMR Scheduling for Exchange** customers still using O365 with a service account to access equipment resources and mailboxes should migrate to using app permissions instead. For full instructions, see [Configuring Office 365 for scheduling using app permissions](scheduling_o365_config.htm). |  |
| Deprecation of password-based authentication for the Teams Connector CVI application | Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is now the default method to authenticate the Teams Connector CVI application towards MS Graph. You can still use the previous password-based authentication method, but we plan to deprecate it in a future release, thus we recommend using CBA for new installations, or migrating to CBA as soon as practicable when upgrading existing deployments. | [Migrating (upgrading) an existing Teams Connector using password-authentication to CBA](teams_managing.htm#migratingcba) |
| Deprecation of v1 legacy themes | We plan to deprecate legacy style "version 1" themes in a future release. If you still use v1 themes you should plan to move to using "version 2" themes instead, which have been available since version 18 of Pexip Infinity. | [Customizing conference images and voice prompts using themes](themes.htm) |
| Deprecation of Google OAuth support | We plan to remove the option to use Google OAuth 2.0 for device alias registrations in a future release of the client API. | [Registering devices to Pexip Infinity](registering_devices.htm) |

| [CVE-2024-6387](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6387) | A race condition was found in OpenSSH's server. If a client does not authenticate within 120 seconds then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously and calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.  **CVSS3.1 base score:** 8.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  **Discussion:** Exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to sustain a large number of connection attempts for a long time (in the original report, which documents an attack on a 32bit architecture, up to 8 hours of attempts were required for a successful exploit). Pexip Infinity runs on a 64bit architecture where the attack is believed to be possible, but where the attack would have to be sustained for several days before success.  From version 27, Pexip Infinity further limits connection attempts to a rate lower than that used in the documented attack. While this will not prevent a successful attack, it will slow an attacker down, thus increasing likelihood of detection as the attack would have to be sustained for longer before success is achieved.  **Mitigation:** Ensure SSH access to Infinity nodes is restricted to trusted networks and/or disable SSH using the Management Web Interface.  **Resolution:** Upgrade to Pexip Infinity v34.2 or later | High | High | July 2024 | 26 ‑ 34.1 | 34.2 |
| CVE-2024-33850 | Incomplete access control checks for participants in the waiting room of a locked conference exposes conference information and may allow these participants to perform actions on the conference.  **CVSS3.1 base score:** 7.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)  **Discussion:** When a conference is locked, participants attempting to join the meeting will be authenticated according to the configured conference access policy and then placed into a waiting room until explicitly admitted by an existing conference host participant. It is possible for participants in the waiting room to obtain the conference roster list and to perform actions on the conference according to the role they would possess after being admitted to the meeting.  **Mitigation:** There is no mitigation available to prevent exposure of the conference roster list to waiting room participants. Minimise the actions available to a waiting room participant by ensuring that locked conferences have a Host PIN configured (or require strong authentication using Identify Providers) so that waiting room participants will only have Guest permissions.  **Resolution:** Upgrade to Pexip Infinity v34.1 or later | High | High |  | 4 ‑ 34.0 | 34.1 |
| CVE-2023-34058 | VMware Tools contains a SAML token signature bypass vulnerability. A malicious actor that has been granted Guest Operation Privileges  **CVSS3.1 base score:** 7.5 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)  **Discussion:** Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the VMware administrator has issued SAML SSO credentials for a user to perform VM Guest Operations and to also have assigned one or more Guest Aliases to the Infinity virtual machines.  **Mitigation:** Pexip neither recommends, nor supports, the assignment of Guest Aliases to Infinity virtual machines. Ensure that no Guest Aliases have been inadvertently assigned to Infinity virtual machines: <https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/d1902b0e-d479-46bf-8ac9-cee0e31e8ec0/07ce8dbd-db48-4261-9b8f-c6d3ad8ba472/vim.vm.guest.AliasManager.html>  **Resolution:** Upgrade to Pexip Infinity v34.0 or later | High | High | March 2024 | All before 34.0 | 34.0 |
