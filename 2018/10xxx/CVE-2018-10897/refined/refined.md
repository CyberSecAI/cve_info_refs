{
  "CVE-2018-10897": {
    "description": "The yum-utils packages provide a collection of utilities and examples for the yum package manager to make yum easier and more powerful to use. The yum-utils: reposync utility has an improper path validation which may lead to directory traversal.",
    "root_cause": "The `reposync` utility in `yum-utils` does not properly validate paths from remote repositories, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper path validation",
      "Directory traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker controlling a remote repository could craft paths that, when synced using reposync, cause files to be written outside of the intended destination directory. This could lead to arbitrary file overwriting, potentially compromising the system if reposync is run with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle attack",
      "Compromised repository"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a yum repository that the victim user is attempting to sync with `reposync`."
