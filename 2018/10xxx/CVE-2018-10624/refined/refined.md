Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Improper error handling in HTTP-based communications with the Metasys or BCPro server. Specifically, the server reveals technical information through error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Information Exposure Through an Error Message (CWE-209): The system divulges potentially sensitive technical details in error messages, which can be used by an attacker to understand the system and plan further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker could obtain technical information about the Metasys or BCPro server. This could allow an attacker to target a system for further attack by giving them insights into the system's workings.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Exploitation occurs through HTTP-based communications with the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker needs to be on an adjacent network to exploit this vulnerability. The attack requires low skill to execute. No authentication is needed to trigger the error.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Metasys System versions 8.0 and prior, and BCPro (BCM) versions prior to 3.0.2.
* The issue was remediated in Metasys v8.1 and BCPro v3.0.2, with earlier mitigations in the BCPro Workstation at v3.0
* No known public exploits are targeting this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
