- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IPConfigure Orchid Core VMS application is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to insufficient input sanitization or validation of user-supplied paths when handling HTTP GET requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal, Information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files outside of the application's web directory. On Linux systems, since the application runs with a user in the sudoers group, any accessible file can be read.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker sends crafted HTTP GET requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required. The attacker needs to know or guess the file path on the target system.
