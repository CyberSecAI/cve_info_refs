Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues: an authentication bypass in the `.srv` functionality and a command injection vulnerability in the `parhand` component of Axis network cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The `.srv` functionality allows for bypassing authentication checks.
2.  **Command Injection:** The `parhand` component is susceptible to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the affected device. This leads to full compromise of the device, potentially enabling a wide range of malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to the device, exploiting the `.srv` functionality and then using the command injection to execute code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device.
- No authentication credentials are required.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses the `dbus` interface to send commands to the `parhand` component, specifically using the `set_param` method with a crafted string to achieve command injection. The vulnerability is triggered by sending HTTP POST requests to the `/index.html/<random>.srv` path.

**Affected Products:**
- Numerous Axis network camera models are affected, including those in the A, C, Companion, D, F, M, P, Q, V, XF, and XP series,  as detailed in the provided "ACV-128401 Affected Product List" document. This list is extensive.

**Mitigation:**
- Axis strongly recommends upgrading to the latest firmware version, as indicated in the affected product list.
- It's also advised not to expose devices directly to the Internet via port forwarding. Axis recommends using its AXIS Companion client for secure remote access.
- Applying IP filtering to whitelist authorized clients is suggested as an additional measure.

**Exploit Availability:**
- A Metasploit module is available for exploiting this vulnerability, as indicated by the provided `exploit-db` content.
