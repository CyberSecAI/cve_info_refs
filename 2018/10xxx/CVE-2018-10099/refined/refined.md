{
  "CVE-2018-10099": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Monorail issue tracker allowed users to download search query results as CSV files without CSRF protection and allowed for duplicated columns. This could lead to Cross-Site Search (XS-Search) attacks due to response length differences based on query results.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of CSRF protection on CSV download functionality",
        "Ability to duplicate columns in CSV output leading to response inflation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit the response-length difference based on query results to infer the existence of private bug reports. They could use this to leak sensitive information such as vulnerable source code file paths and line numbers.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker would craft a malicious link to trigger a CSV download containing a specific search query with duplicated columns. They would use time-based analysis of the CSV download to infer if a given search query returned any results, effectively extracting the content of private bug reports.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link, which would cause them to perform actions on the Monorail issue tracker on behalf of the attacker. The attacker also requires the ability to make timing-based measurements of the response."
