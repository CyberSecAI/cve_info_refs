Package        : linux
Version        : 3.2.102-1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1093 CVE-2018-1130 CVE-2018-8897 CVE-2018-10940
Debian Bug     : 898100

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-8897

    Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions
    that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled,
    allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.102-1.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream version
3.2.102, including a fix for a regression in the SCTP implementation
in version 3.2.101.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

                 CVE-2018-1000204
Debian Bug     : 898165

The previous update to linux failed to build for the armhf (ARM EABI
hard-float) architecture.  This update corrects that.  For all other
architectures, there is no need to upgrade or reboot again.  For
reference, the relevant part of the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using new microcoded features.

    This mitigation requires an update to the processor's microcode,
    which is non-free.  For recent Intel processors, this is included
    in the intel-microcode package from version 3.20180425.1~deb8u1.
    For other processors, it may be included in an update to the
    system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a later update to the
    amd64-microcode package.

    This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86 architecture
    by the "retpoline" feature.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
    malicious server for denial of service.

    The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
    appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an alternate
    fix.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3665

    Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86
    processors can speculatively read floating-point and vector
    registers even when access to those registers is disabled.  The
    Linux kernel's "lazy FPU" feature relies on that access control to
    avoid saving and restoring those registers for tasks that do not
    use them, and was enabled by default on x86 processors that do
    not support the XSAVEOPT instruction.

    If "lazy FPU" is enabled on one of the affected processors, an
    attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able to read
    sensitive information from other users' processes or the kernel.
    This specifically affects processors based on the "Nehalem" and
    "Westemere" core designs.

    This issue has been mitigated by disabling "lazy FPU" by default
    on all x86 processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR
    instructions, which includes all processors known to be affected
    and most processors that perform speculative execution.  It can
    also be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

    It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
    unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.57-1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug #898165, and
includes many more bug fixes from stable update 3.16.57.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the ext4 implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate meta block groups. An attacker with physical

access could use this to specially craft an ext4 image that causes a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-10208](/security/CVE-2016-10208))

It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in

the ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory addresses).

([CVE-2017-11472](/security/CVE-2017-11472))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ACPI table parsing

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

construct a malicious ACPI table that, when loaded, caused a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-11473](/security/CVE-2017-11473))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly initialize data returned to user space in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2017-14991](/security/CVE-2017-14991))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the packet fanout

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-15649](/security/CVE-2017-15649))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the Ultra Wide Band driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for an error condition. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16526](/security/CVE-2017-16526))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-16527](/security/CVE-2017-16527))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate USB audio buffer descriptors. A physically proximate

attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16529](/security/CVE-2017-16529))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate USB interface association descriptors. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16531](/security/CVE-2017-16531))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16532](/security/CVE-2017-16532))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate USB HID descriptors. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16533](/security/CVE-2017-16533))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate USB BOS metadata. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16535](/security/CVE-2017-16535))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the Conexant cx231xx USB video capture

driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptors.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16536](/security/CVE-2017-16536))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16537](/security/CVE-2017-16537))

It was discovered that the DM04/QQBOX USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle device attachment and warm-start. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16538](/security/CVE-2017-16538))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the GTCO digitizer USB

driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-alt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2948)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3658021>

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting CVE-2018-3639; Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391; Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-1120; David Rientjes (Google) for reporting CVE-2018-1000200; and Wen Xu for reporting CVE-2018-1092, CVE-2018-1094, and CVE-2018-1095. The CVE-2018-14619 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer (Red Hat) and Ondrej Mosnacek (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

ACPI / video: Only default only\_lcd to true on Win8-ready \_desktops\_
commit 53fa1f6e8a5958da698a31edf366ffe90596b490 upstream.
Commit 5928c281524f (ACPI / video: Default lcd\_only to true on Win8-ready
and newer machines) made only\_lcd default to true on all machines where
acpi\_osi\_is\_win8() returns true, including laptops.
The purpose of this is to avoid the bogus / non-working acpi backlight
interface which many newer BIOS-es define on desktop machines.
But this is causing a regression on some laptops, specifically on the
Dell XPS 13 2013 model, which does not have the LCD flag set for its
fully functional ACPI backlight interface.
Rather then DMI quirking our way out of this, this commits changes the
logic for setting only\_lcd to true, to only do this on machines with
a desktop (or server) dmi chassis-type.
Note that we cannot simply only check the chassis-type and not register
the backlight interface based on that as there are some laptops and
tablets which have their chassis-type set to "3" aka desktop. Hopefully
the combination of checking the LCD flag, but only on devices with
a desktop(ish) chassis-type will avoid the needs for DMI quirks for this,
or at least limit the amount of DMI quirks which we need to a minimum.

kprobes: Fix random address output of blacklist file
commit bcbd385b61bbdef3491d662203ac2e8186e5be59 upstream.
File /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist displays random addresses:
[root@s8360046 linux]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist
0x0000000047149a90-0x00000000bfcb099a print\_type\_x8
....
This breaks 'perf probe' which uses the blacklist file to prohibit
probes on certain functions by checking the address range.
Fix this by printing the correct (unhashed) address.
The file mode is read all but this is not an issue as the file
hierarchy points out:
# ls -ld /sys/ /sys/kernel/ /sys/kernel/debug/ /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/
/sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist
dr-xr-xr-x 12 root root 0 Apr 19 07:56 /sys/
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 0 Apr 19 07:56 /sys/kernel/
drwx------ 16 root root 0 Apr 19 06:56 /sys/kernel/debug/
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Apr 19 06:56 /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Apr 19 06:56 /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist
Everything in and below /sys/kernel/debug is rwx to root only,
no group or others have access.
Background:
Directory /sys/kernel/debug/kprobes is created by debugfs\_create\_dir()
which sets the mode bits to rwxr-xr-x. Maybe change that to use the
parent's directory mode bits instead?

outdated LCU data. If there is a difference, perform a re-read of that

s390/cio: update chpid descriptor after resource accessibility event
commit af2e460ade0b0180d0f3812ca4f4f59cc9597f3e upstream.
Channel path descriptors have been seen as something stable (as
long as the chpid is configured). Recent tests have shown that the
descriptor can also be altered when the link state of a channel path
changes. Thus it is necessary to update the descriptor during
handling of resource accessibility events.

block/swim: Fix IO error at end of medium
commit 5a13388d7aa1177b98d7168330ecbeeac52f844d upstream.
Reading to the end of a 720K disk results in an IO error instead of EOF
because the block layer thinks the disk has 2880 sectors. (Partly this
is a result of inverted logic of the ONEMEG\_MEDIA bit that's now fixed.)
Initialize the density and head count in swim\_add\_floppy() to agree
with the device size passed to set\_capacity() during drive probe.
Call set\_capacity() again upon device open, after refreshing the density
and head count values.

can be a NULL pointer when drive == swd->floppy\_count. This causes

commit 56a1c5ee54f69dd767fb61d301883dc919ddc259 upstream.
The Sony drive status bits use active-low logic. The swim\_readbit()
function converts that to 'C' logic for readability. Hence, the
sense of the names of the status bit macros should not be inverted.
Mostly they are correct. However, the TWOMEG\_DRIVE, MFM\_MODE and
TWOMEG\_MEDIA macros have inverted sense (like MkLinux). Fix this
inconsistency and make the following patches less confusing.
The same problem affects swim3.c so fix that too.
No functional change.
The FDHD drive status bits are documented in sonydriv.cpp from MAME
and in swimiii.h from MkLinux.

There's no need to call ioremap() for the SWIM address range, as it lies
within the usual IO device region at 0x5000 0000, which has already been

Remove the redundant ioremap() and iounmap() calls to fix the hang.

fsnotify: Fix fsnotify\_mark\_connector race
commit d90a10e2444ba5a351fa695917258ff4c5709fa5 upstream.
fsnotify() acquires a reference to a fsnotify\_mark\_connector through
the SRCU-protected pointer to\_tell->i\_fsnotify\_marks. However, it
appears that no precautions are taken in fsnotify\_put\_mark() to
ensure that fsnotify() drops its reference to this
fsnotify\_mark\_connector before assigning a value to its 'destroy\_next'
field. This can result in fsnotify\_put\_mark() assigning a value
to a connector's 'destroy\_next' field right before fsnotify() tries to
traverse the linked list referenced by the connector's 'list' field.
Since these two fields are members of the same union, this behavior
results in a kernel panic.
This issue is resolved by moving the connector's 'destroy\_next' field
into the object pointer union. This should work since the object pointer
access is protected by both a spinlock and the value of the 'flags'
field, and the 'flags' field is cleared while holding the spinlock in
fsnotify\_put\_mark() before 'destroy\_next' is updated. It shouldn't be
possible for another thread to accidentally read from the object pointer
after the 'destroy\_next' field is updated.
The offending behavior here is extremely unlikely; since
fsnotify\_put\_mark() removes references to a connector (specifically,
it ensures that the connector is unreachable from the inode it was
formerly attached to) before updating its 'destroy\_next' field, a
sizeable chunk of code in fsnotify\_put\_mark() has to execute in the
short window between when fsnotify() acquires the connector reference
and saves the value of its 'list' field. On the HEAD kernel, I've only
been able to reproduce this by inserting a udelay(1) in fsnotify().
However, I've been able to reproduce this issue without inserting a
udelay(1) anywhere on older unmodified release kernels, so I believe
it's worth fixing at HEAD.

This cast is wrong. "cdi->capacity" is an int and "arg" is an unsigned

[ Upstream commit 12e571693837d6164bda61e316b1944972ee0d97 ]
When sending control commands, virtio net sets up several buffers for
DMA. The buffers are all part of the net device which means it's
actually allocated by kvmalloc so it's in theory (on extreme memory
pressure) possible to get a vmalloc'ed buffer which on some platforms
means we can't DMA there.
Fix up by moving the DMA buffers into a separate structure.

tun: fix vlan packet truncation
[ Upstream commit 81c895072d29cd70eea5be1a8587cd6461c3715a ]
Bogus trimming in tun\_net\_xmit() causes truncated vlan packets.
skb->len is correct whether or not skb\_vlan\_tag\_present() is true. There
is no more reason to adjust the skb length on xmit in this driver than
any other driver. tun\_put\_user() adds 4 bytes to the total for tagged
packets because it transmits the tag inline to userspace. This is
similar to a nic transmitting the tag inline on the wire.
Reproducing the bug by sending any tagged packet through back-to-back
connected tap interfaces:
socat TUN,tun-type=tap,iff-up,tun-name=in TUN,tun-type=tap,iff-up,tun-name=out &
ip link add link in name in.20 type vlan id 20

net: aquantia: Regression on reset with 1.x firmware
[ Upstream commit cce96d1883dae4b79f44890e5118243d806da286 ]
On ASUS XG-C100C with 1.5.44 firmware a special mode called "dirty wake"
is active. With this mode when motherboard gets powered (but no poweron
happens yet), NIC automatically enables powersave link and watches
for WOL packet.
This normally allows to powerup the PC after AC power failures.
Not all motherboards or bios settings gives power to PCI slots,
so this mode is not enabled on all the hardware.
4.16 linux driver introduced full hardware reset sequence
This is required since before that we had no NIC hardware
reset implemented and there were side effects of "not clean start".
But this full reset is incompatible with "dirty wake" WOL feature
it keeps the PHY link in a special mode forever. As a consequence,
driver sees no link and no traffic.
To fix this we forcibly change FW state to idle state before doing
the full reset. This makes FW to restore link state.

VSOCK: make af\_vsock.ko removable again
[ Upstream commit 05e489b1596f0aa1025a1fa572676631cd9665da ]
Commit c1eef220c1760762753b602c382127bfccee226d ("vsock: always call
vsock\_init\_tables()") introduced a module\_init() function without a
corresponding module\_exit() function.
Modules with an init function can only be removed if they also have an
exit function. Therefore the vsock module was considered "permanent"
and could not be removed.
This patch adds an empty module\_exit() function so that "rmmod vsock"
works. No explicit cleanup is required because:
1. Transports call vsock\_core\_exit() upon exit and cannot be removed

virtio-net: add missing virtqueue kick when flushing packets
[ Upstream commit 9267c430c6b6f4c0120e3c6bb847313d633f02a6 ]
We tends to batch submitting packets during XDP\_TX. This requires to
kick virtqueue after a batch, we tried to do it through
xdp\_do\_flush\_map() which only makes sense for devmap not XDP\_TX. So
explicitly kick the virtqueue in this case.

bnxt\_en: Fix memory fault in bnxt\_ethtool\_init()
[ Upstream commit a60faa60da891e311e19fd3e88d611863f431130 ]
In some firmware images, the length of BNX\_DIR\_TYPE\_PKG\_LOG nvram type
could be greater than the fixed buffer length of 4096 bytes allocated by
the driver. This was causing HWRM\_NVM\_READ to copy more data to the buffer
than the allocated size, causing general protection fault.
Fix the issue by allocating the exact buffer length returned by
HWRM\_NVM\_FIND\_DIR\_ENTRY, instead of 4096. Move the kzalloc() call
into the bnxt\_get\_pkgver() function.

s390/qeth: avoid control IO completion stalls
[ Upstream commit 901e3f49facbd31b2b3d1786637b4a35e1022e9b ]
For control IO, qeth currently tracks the index of the buffer that it
expects to complete the next IO on each qeth\_channel. If the channel
presents an IRQ while this buffer has not yet completed, no completion
processing for \_any\_ completed buffer takes place.
So if the 'next buffer' is skipped for any sort of reason\* (eg. when it
is released due to error conditions, before the IO is started), the
buffer obviously won't switch to PROCESSED until it is eventually
allocated for a \_different\_ IO and completes.
Until this happens, all completion processing on that channel stalls
and pending requests possibly time out.
As a fix, remove the whole 'next buffer' logic and simply process any
IO buffer right when it completes. A channel will never have more than
one IO pending, so there's no risk of processing out-of-sequence.
\*Note: currently just one location in the code really handles this problem,
by advancing the 'next' index manually.

l2tp: fix {pppol2tp, l2tp\_dfs}\_seq\_stop() in case of seq\_file overflow
[ Upstream commit 5411b6187adf62909e3b998ac782e722904c7487 ]
Commit 0e0c3fee3a59 ("l2tp: hold reference on tunnels printed in pppol2tp proc file")
assumed that if pppol2tp\_seq\_stop() was called with non-NULL private
data (the 'v' pointer), then pppol2tp\_seq\_start() would not be called
again. It turns out that this isn't guaranteed, and overflowing the
seq\_file's buffer in pppol2tp\_seq\_show() is a way to get into this
situation.
Therefore, pppol2tp\_seq\_stop() needs to reset pd->tunnel, so that
pppol2tp\_seq\_start() won't drop a reference again if it gets called.
We also have to clear pd->session, because the rest of the code expects
a non-NULL tunnel when pd->session is set.
The l2tp\_debugfs module has the same issue. Fix it in the same way.

l2tp: hold reference on tunnels printed in pppol2tp proc file
[ Upstream commit 0e0c3fee3a59a387aeecc4fca6f3a2e9615a5443 ]
Use l2tp\_tunnel\_get\_nth() instead of l2tp\_tunnel\_find\_nth(), to be safe
against concurrent tunnel deletion.
Unlike sessions, we can't drop the reference held on tunnels in
pppol2tp\_seq\_show(). Tunnels are reused across several calls to
pppol2tp\_seq\_start() when iterating over sessions. These iterations
need the tunnel for accessing the next session. Therefore the only safe
moment for dropping the reference is just before searching for the next
tunnel.
Normally, the last invocation of pppol2tp\_next\_tunnel() doesn't find
any new tunnel, so it drops the last tunnel without taking any new
reference. However, in case of error, pppol2tp\_seq\_stop() is called
directly, so we have to drop the reference there.

drop it after it stops using the tunnel.

amd-xgbe: Improve KR auto-negotiation and training
[ Upstream commit 96f4d430c507ed4856048c2dc9c1a2ea5b5e74e4 ]
Update xgbe-phy-v2.c to make use of the auto-negotiation (AN) phy hooks
to improve the ability to successfully complete Clause 73 AN when running
at 10gbps. Hardware can sometimes have issues with CDR lock when the
AN DME page exchange is being performed.
The AN and KR training hooks are used as follows:
- The pre AN hook is used to disable CDR tracking in the PHY so that the
DME page exchange can be successfully and consistently completed.
- The post KR training hook is used to re-enable the CDR tracking so that
KR training can successfully complete.
- The post AN hook is used to check for an unsuccessful AN which will
increase a CDR tracking enablement delay (up to a maximum value).
Add two debugfs entries to allow control over use of the CDR tracking
workaround. The debugfs entries allow the CDR tracking workaround to
be disabled and determine whether to re-enable CDR tracking before or
after link training has been initiated.
Also, with these changes the receiver reset cycle that is performed during
the link status check can be performed less often.

ip header from sizeof(ethhdr) and leads to incorrect pointer reference.
This patch fixes this issue by taking sizeof(vlan\_ethhdr) into account
if vlan tag is present and correctly references the ip hdr.

vlan: Fix reading memory beyond skb->tail in skb\_vlan\_tagged\_multi
[ Upstream commit 7ce2367254e84753bceb07327aaf5c953cfce117 ]
Syzkaller spotted an old bug which leads to reading skb beyond tail by 4
bytes on vlan tagged packets.
This is caused because skb\_vlan\_tagged\_multi() did not check
skb\_headlen.

team: avoid adding twice the same option to the event list
[ Upstream commit 4fb0534fb7bbc2346ba7d3a072b538007f4135a5 ]
When parsing the options provided by the user space,
team\_nl\_cmd\_options\_set() insert them in a temporary list to send
multiple events with a single message.
While each option's attribute is correctly validated, the code does
not check for duplicate entries before inserting into the event
list.
Exploiting the above, the syzbot was able to trigger the following
splat:

tcp: md5: reject TCP\_MD5SIG or TCP\_MD5SIG\_EXT on established sockets
[ Upstream commit 7212303268918b9a203aebeacfdbd83b5e87b20d ]
syzbot/KMSAN reported an uninit-value in tcp\_parse\_options() [1]
I believe this was caused by a TCP\_MD5SIG being set on live
flow.
This is highly unexpected, since TCP option space is limited.
For instance, presence of TCP MD5 option automatically disables
TCP TimeStamp option at SYN/SYNACK time, which we can not do
once flow has been established.
Really, adding/deleting an MD5 key only makes sense on sockets
in CLOSE or LISTEN state.

tcp: don't read out-of-bounds opsize
[ Upstream commit 7e5a206ab686f098367b61aca989f5cdfa8114a3 ]
The old code reads the "opsize" variable from out-of-bounds memory (first
byte behind the segment) if a broken TCP segment ends directly after an
opcode that is neither EOL nor NOP.
The result of the read isn't used for anything, so the worst thing that
could theoretically happen is a pagefault; and since the physmap is usually
mostly contiguous, even that seems pretty unlikely.
The following C reproducer triggers the uninitialized read - however, you
can't actually see anything happen unless you put something like a
pr\_warn() in tcp\_parse\_md5sig\_option() to print the opsize.

tcp: clear tp->packets\_out when purging write queue
[ Upstream commit bffd168c3fc5cc7d2bad4c668fa90e7a9010db4b ]
Clear tp->packets\_out when purging the write queue, otherwise
tcp\_rearm\_rto() mistakenly assumes TCP write queue is not empty.
This results in NULL pointer dereference.
Also, remove the redundant `tp->packets\_out = 0` from
tcp\_disconnect(), since tcp\_disconnect() calls
tcp\_write\_queue\_purge().

strparser: Fix incorrect strp->need\_bytes value.
[ Upstream commit 9d0c75bf6e03d9bf80c55b0f677dc9b982958fd5 ]
strp\_data\_ready resets strp->need\_bytes to 0 if strp\_peek\_len indicates
that the remainder of the message has been received. However,
do\_strp\_work does not reset strp->need\_bytes to 0. If do\_strp\_work
completes a partial message, the value of strp->need\_bytes will continue
to reflect the needed bytes of the previous message, causing
future invocations of strp\_data\_ready to return early if
strp->need\_bytes is less than strp\_peek\_len. Resetting strp->need\_bytes
to 0 in \_\_strp\_recv on handing a full message to the upper layer solves
this problem.
\_\_strp\_recv also calculates strp->need\_bytes using stm->accum\_len before
stm->accum\_len has been incremented by cand\_len. This can cause
strp->need\_bytes to be equal to the full length of the message instead
of the full length minus the accumulated length. This, in turn, causes
strp\_data\_ready to return early, even when there is sufficient data to
complete the partial message. Incrementing stm->accum\_len before using
it to calculate strp->need\_bytes solves this problem.

strparser: Do not call mod\_delayed\_work with a timeout of LONG\_MAX
[ Upstream commit 7c5aba211dd61f41d737a2c51729eb9fdcd3edf4 ]
struct sock's sk\_rcvtimeo is initialized to
LONG\_MAX/MAX\_SCHEDULE\_TIMEOUT in sock\_init\_data. Calling
mod\_delayed\_work with a timeout of LONG\_MAX causes spurious execution of
the work function. timer->expires is set equal to jiffies + LONG\_MAX.
When timer\_base->clk falls behind the current value of jiffies,
the delta between timer\_base->clk and jiffies + LONG\_MAX causes the
expiration to be in the past. Returning early from strp\_start\_timer if
timeo == LONG\_MAX solves this problem.
Found while testing net/tls\_sw recv path.

sctp: do not check port in sctp\_inet6\_cmp\_addr
[ Upstream commit 1071ec9d453a38023579714b64a951a2fb982071 ]
pf->cmp\_addr() is called before binding a v6 address to the sock. It
should not check ports, like in sctp\_inet\_cmp\_addr.
But sctp\_inet6\_cmp\_addr checks the addr by invoking af(6)->cmp\_addr,
sctp\_v6\_cmp\_addr where it also compares the ports.
This would cause that setsockopt(SCTP\_SOCKOPT\_BINDX\_ADD) could bind
multiple duplicated IPv6 addresses after Commit 40b4f0fd74e4 ("sctp:
lack the check for ports in sctp\_v6\_cmp\_addr").
This patch is to remove af->cmp\_addr called in sctp\_inet6\_cmp\_addr,
but do the proper check for both v6 addrs and v4mapped addrs.
v1->v2:
- define \_\_sctp\_v6\_cmp\_addr to do the common address comparison
used for both pf and af v6 cmp\_addr.

net: fix deadlock while clearing neighbor proxy table
[ Upstream commit 53b76cdf7e8fecec1d09e38aad2f8579882591a8 ]
When coming from ndisc\_netdev\_event() in net/ipv6/ndisc.c,
neigh\_ifdown() is called with &nd\_tbl, locking this while
clearing the proxy neighbor entries when eg. deleting an
interface. Calling the table's pndisc\_destructor() with the
lock still held, however, can cause a deadlock: When a
multicast listener is available an IGMP packet of type
ICMPV6\_MGM\_REDUCTION may be sent out. When reaching
ip6\_finish\_output2(), if no neighbor entry for the target
address is found, \_\_neigh\_create() is called with &nd\_tbl,
which it'll want to lock.
Move the elements into their own list, then unlock the table
and perform the destruction.

on dst\_entry in case of IPv4 traffic results on the following bug.
Using just dst->dev should fix this BUG.

ipv6: add RTA\_TABLE and RTA\_PREFSRC to rtm\_ipv6\_policy
[ Upstream commit aa8f8778493c85fff480cdf8b349b1e1dcb5f243 ]
KMSAN reported use of uninit-value that I tracked to lack
of proper size check on RTA\_TABLE attribute.
I also believe RTA\_PREFSRC lacks a similar check.

bonding: do not set slave\_dev npinfo before slave\_enable\_netpoll in bond\_enslave
[ Upstream commit ddea788c63094f7c483783265563dd5b50052e28 ]
After Commit 8a8efa22f51b ("bonding: sync netpoll code with bridge"), it
would set slave\_dev npinfo in slave\_enable\_netpoll when enslaving a dev
if bond->dev->npinfo was set.
However now slave\_dev npinfo is set with bond->dev->npinfo before calling
slave\_enable\_netpoll. With slave\_dev npinfo set, \_\_netpoll\_setup called
in slave\_enable\_netpoll will not call slave dev's .ndo\_netpoll\_setup().
It causes that the lower dev of this slave dev can't set its npinfo.
One way to reproduce it:
# modprobe bonding
# brctl addbr br0
# brctl addif br0 eth1
# ifconfig bond0 192.168.122.1/24 up
# ifenslave bond0 eth2
# systemctl restart netconsole
# ifenslave bond0 br0
# ifconfig eth2 down
# systemctl restart netconsole
The netpoll won't really work.
This patch is to remove that slave\_dev npinfo setting in bond\_enslave().

Revert "ath10k: send (re)assoc peer command when NSS changed"
commit 55cc11da69895a680940c1733caabc37be685f5e upstream.
This reverts commit 55884c045d31a29cf69db8332d1064a1b61dd159.
When Ath10k is in AP mode and an unassociated STA sends a VHT action frame
(Operating Mode Notification for the NSS change) periodically to AP this causes
ath10k to call ath10k\_station\_assoc() which sends WMI\_PEER\_ASSOC\_CMDID during
NSS update. Over the time (with a certain client it can happen within 15 mins
when there are over 500 of these VHT action frames) continuous calls of
WMI\_PEER\_ASSOC\_CMDID cause firmware to assert due to resource exhaust.
To my knowledge setting WMI\_PEER\_NSS peer param itself enough to handle NSS
updates and no need to call ath10k\_station\_assoc(). So revert the original
commit from 2014 as it's unclear why the change was really needed.
Now the firmware assert doesn't happen anymore.
Issue observed in QCA9984 platform with firmware version:10.4-3.5.3-00053.
This Change tested in QCA9984 with firmware version: 10.4-3.5.3-00053 and
QCA988x platform with firmware version: 10.2.4-1.0-00036.

tpm: add retry logic
commit e2fb992d82c626c43ed0566e07c410e56a087af3 upstream.
TPM2 can return TPM2\_RC\_RETRY to any command and when it does we get
unexpected failures inside the kernel that surprise users (this is
mostly observed in the trusted key handling code). The UEFI 2.6 spec
has advice on how to handle this:
The firmware SHALL not return TPM2\_RC\_RETRY prior to the completion
of the call to ExitBootServices().
Implementer’s Note: the implementation of this function should check
the return value in the TPM response and, if it is TPM2\_RC\_RETRY,
resend the command. The implementation may abort if a sufficient
number of retries has been done.
So we follow that advice in our tpm\_transmit() code using
TPM2\_DURATION\_SHORT as the initial wait duration and
TPM2\_DURATION\_LONG as the maximum wait time. This should fix all the
in-kernel use cases and also means that user space TSS implementations
don't have to have their own retry handling.

tpm: cmd\_ready command can be issued only after granting locality
commit 888d867df4417deffc33927e6fc2c6925736fe92 upstream.
The correct sequence is to first request locality and only after
that perform cmd\_ready handshake, otherwise the hardware will drop
the subsequent message as from the device point of view the cmd\_ready
handshake wasn't performed. Symmetrically locality has to be relinquished
only after going idle handshake has completed, this requires that
go\_idle has to poll for the completion and as well locality
relinquish has to poll for completion so it is not overridden
in back to back commands flow.
Two wrapper functions are added (request\_locality relinquish\_locality)
to simplify the error handling.
The issue is only visible on devices that support multiple localities.

i40e: Fix attach VF to VM issue
commit 028daf80117376b22909becd9720daaefdfceff4 upstream.
Fix for "Resource temporarily unavailable" problem when virsh is
trying to attach a device to VM. When the VF driver is loaded on
host and virsh is trying to attach it to the VM and set a MAC
address, it ends with a race condition between i40e\_reset\_vf and
i40e\_ndo\_set\_vf\_mac functions. The bug is fixed by adding polling
in i40e\_ndo\_set\_vf\_mac function For when the VF is in Reset mode.

Revert "pinctrl: intel: Initialize GPIO properly when used through irqchip"
This reverts commit f5a26acf0162477af6ee4c11b4fb9cffe5d3e257
Mike writes:
It seems that commit f5a26acf0162 ("pinctrl: intel: Initialize GPIO
properly when used through irqchip") can cause problems on some Skylake
systems with Sunrisepoint PCH-H. Namely on certain systems it may turn
the backlight PWM pin from native mode to GPIO which makes the screen
blank during boot.
There is more information here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1543769
The actual reason is that GPIO numbering used in BIOS is using "Windows"
numbers meaning that they don't match the hardware 1:1 and because of
this a wrong pin (backlight PWM) is picked and switched to GPIO mode.
There is a proper fix for this but since it has quite many dependencies
on commits that cannot be considered stable material, I suggest we
revert commit f5a26acf0162 from stable trees 4.9, 4.14 and 4.15 to
prevent the backlight issue.

cdrom: information leak in cdrom\_ioctl\_media\_changed()This cast is wrong. "cdi->capacity" is an int and "arg" is an unsigned
long. The way the check is written now, if one of the high 32 bits is
set then we could read outside the info->slots[] array.
This bug is pretty old and it predates git.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost/vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

Debian Bug     : 860900 872907 892057 896775 897590 898137

Linux 4.9 has been packaged for Debian 8 as linux-4.9.  This provides
a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use kernel
packages from the "jessie-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 3.16, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    hyperv-daemons libcpupower1 libcpupower-dev libusbip-dev
    linux-compiler-gcc-4.9-x86 linux-cpupower linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from other source packages
in Debian 8.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-18255

    It was discovered that the performance events subsystem did not
    properly validate the value of the
    kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent sysctl.  Setting a large value
    could have an unspecified security impact.  However, only a
    privileged user can set this sysctl.

CVE-2018-1118

    The syzbot software found that the vhost driver did not initialise
    message buffers which would later be read by user processes.  A
    user with access to the /dev/vhost-net device could use this to
    read sensitive information from the kernel or other users'
    processes.

CVE-2018-1120

    Qualys reported that a user able to mount FUSE filesystems can
    create a process such that when another process attempting to read
    its command line will be blocked for an arbitrarily long time.
    This could be used for denial of service, or to aid in exploiting
    a race condition in the other program.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3639

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context.  In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox.  This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update allows the issue to be mitigated on some x86
    processors by disabling SSB.  This requires an update to the
    processor's microcode, which is non-free.  It may be included in
    an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a future
    update to the intel-microcode or amd64-microcode packages.

    Disabling SSB can reduce performance significantly, so by default
    it is only done in tasks that use the seccomp feature.
    Applications that require this mitigation should request it
    explicitly through the prctl() system call.  Users can control
    where the mitigation is enabled with the spec_store_bypass_disable
    kernel parameter.

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-10021

    A physically present attacker who unplugs a SAS cable can cause a
    denial of service (memory leak and WARN).

CVE-2018-10087, CVE-2018-10124

    zhongjiang found that the wait4() and kill() system call
    implementations did not check for the invalid pid value of
    INT_MIN.  If a user passed this value, the behaviour of the code
    was formally undefined and might have had a security impact.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10876, CVE-2018-10877, CVE-2018-10878, CVE-2018-10879,
CVE-2018-10880, CVE-2018-10881, CVE-2018-10882, CVE-2018-10883

    Wen Xu at SSLab, Gatech, reported that crafted ext4 filesystem
    images could trigger a crash or memory corruption.  A local user
    able to mount arbitrary filesystems, or an attacker providing
    filesystems to be mounted, could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-1~deb8u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#860900, #872907, #892057, #896775, #897590, and #898137; and
includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.89-4.9.110
inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

                 CVE-2018-1000204
Debian Bug     : 898165

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armhf (ARM EABI hard-float)
architecture.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using new microcoded features.

    This mitigation requires an update to the processor's microcode,
    which is non-free.  For recent Intel processors, this is included
    in the intel-microcode package from version 3.20180425.1~deb8u1.
    For other processors, it may be included in an update to the
    system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a later update to the
    amd64-microcode package.

    This vulnerability was already mitigated for the x86 architecture
    by the "retpoline" feature.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation. This could be used by a
    malicious server for denial of service.

    The previously applied mitigation for this issue was not
    appropriate for Linux 3.16 and has been replaced by an alternate
    fix.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3665

    Multiple researchers have discovered that some Intel x86
    processors can speculatively read floating-point and vector
    registers even when access to those registers is disabled.  The
    Linux kernel's "lazy FPU" feature relies on that access control to
    avoid saving and restoring those registers for tasks that do not
    use them, and was enabled by default on x86 processors that do
    not support the XSAVEOPT instruction.

    If "lazy FPU" is enabled on one of the affected processors, an
    attacker controlling an unprivileged process may be able to read
    sensitive information from other users' processes or the kernel.
    This specifically affects processors based on the "Nehalem" and
    "Westemere" core designs.

    This issue has been mitigated by disabling "lazy FPU" by default
    on all x86 processors that support the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR
    instructions, which includes all processors known to be affected
    and most processors that perform speculative execution.  It can
    also be mitigated by adding the kernel parameter: eagerfpu=on

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-9422

    It was reported that the futex() system call could be used by an
    unprivileged user for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3695-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly initialize the crc32c checksum driver. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-1094](/security/CVE-2018-1094))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr sizes. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1095](/security/CVE-2018-1095))

Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for

64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user

space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-11508](/security/CVE-2018-11508))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-24-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-24-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-24.26~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

cdrom: information leak in cdrom\_ioctl\_media\_changed()

This cast is wrong.  "cdi->capacity" is an int and "arg" is an unsigned
long.  The way the check is written now, if one of the high 32 bits is
set then we could read outside the info->slots[] array.

This bug is pretty old and it predates git.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c0)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-05-31 15:44:47 UTC  ``` After upgrading to kernel kernel-3.10.0-862.2.3.el7.x86_64 as well as kernel-3.10.0-862.3.2.el7.x86_64  I've having the following problem: After I migrate a VM to another hypervisor (live migration), the VM has very big delays  - ssh login slow. I get motd and then after maybe a minute the prompt - top does not refresh - tcpdump does not output - ACPI events to VM never appear - some times complete hung (no console - no network)  All these are fixed if I put interrupt pressure on the VM, for instance dd the whole disk to /dev/null. While dd eveything is back to normal. When I stop dd, problems appear again.  It's like waiting for a buffer/queue to fill up before doing anything.  All of these problems stop when I boot hypervisor nodes to  kernel-3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64  Problems are also gone if I (live) migrate to a hypervisor node with  kernel-3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64. This works also with a complete frozen VM.  I've noticed this with OpenBSD vms. I've also noticed random (not consistent) hungs (complete freeze without access at all) to EL5 VMs. I don't have problems with EL6, EL7 VMs so far.  Environment is EL7 up2date running latest version of ovirt 4.2.3   I've also tried downgrading other parts like qemu-img-ev or trying other options on ovirt but nothing did a change.  Also in another infrastructure running kernel-3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64 and ovirt 4.2.2 I don't have these kind of problems with any of the VMs.  Probably a bug come up with kernel-3.10.0-862.2.3.el7.x86_64  regards  Giannis   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c2)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-01 10:07:33 UTC  ``` Unfortunately kernel-3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64 is also causing the exact same problems.  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1062](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1062)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c3)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2018-06-01 14:12:44 UTC  ``` Hi Giannis,   Thanks for the report; I've got some questions:      a) Can you describe the hardware you're running this on - eg a cat /proc/cpuinfo from the host; also what connection are you migrating over (1G or 10G? etc)     b) are there any errors in the host dmesg after the migrate?     c) Can you provide a copy of /var/log/libvirt/qemu/THEINSTANCE.log for the VM instances of both the openbsd and rhel5 VMs; preferably matching ones from a source and destination host  which show the migration     d) have you got matching versions of qemu-kvm installed on source and destination?     e) Are the host clocks synchronised (e.g. with ntp)     f) how often does the rhel5 migration fail - e.g. 1/5 or 1/10 etc?     g) how often does the openbsd migration fail?  We don't test OpenBSD much - but the fact it's a regression is interesting, so worth understanding; and rhel5 guest should work.  Thanks,  Dave   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c4)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-01 15:29:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1446729](attachment.cgi?id=1446729 "engine.log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1446729&action=edit "engine.log") engine.log   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c5)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-01 15:29:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1446730](attachment.cgi?id=1446730 "qemu from source host") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1446730&action=edit "qemu from source host") qemu from source host   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c6)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-01 15:30:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1446731](attachment.cgi?id=1446731 "qemu from dest host") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1446731&action=edit "qemu from dest host") qemu from dest host   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c7)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-01 15:30:30 UTC  ``` I have 2 kinds of machines but they behave the same:  1) nodes of Dell PowerEdge R730: 2 x E5-2680 v4 2) nodes of IBM System x3650 M4: -[7915LRN]-: 2 x E5-2640 v2 you want flags?

I'll have to check with libvirt/qemu  All software is the same on all hypervisors (kernel, libvirt, vdsm, qemu etc.)  Clocks are synced on hypervisors with chrony. VMs also sync time (ntp/chrony).  Migration is not failing. Problems/hungs occur after migration. It doesn't seem like a network problem cause a shell prior to migration continues to operate normally. New (console also) logins delay.  Funny staff with top/tcpdump.  On OpenBSD 100% every time.  On EL5 it's quite random. I've noticed this twice on the last 2 upgrades (from 7.4->7.5 and yesterday patching 7.5) that the EL5 machines got stack. I couldn't ping and I couldn't access the VM console. I did a power cycle on them However on later migrations I didn't -always- reproduce the problem.  Nevertheless I would also like to try revert some patches and see what happens. For instance I see this:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3411331> coming from [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1130](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1130) Previously, migrating a virtual machine (VM) using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) sometimes corrupted the ymm registers, leading to guest-visible register corruption. This happened because the kernel failed to preserve some vector registers when asked by QEMU. With this update, the kernel now preserves the correct registers, and the described problem no longer occurs. ([BZ#1542617](show_bug.cgi?id=1542617))  Don't know if it's related but I don't have access to that BZ/patch to test it out.  Also I'm willing to try kernel kernel-3.10.0-693.25.2.el7 to see if I can reproduced it there too. Don't have access there either.  About the qemu logs. They are in UTC. engine log is on UTC+3  You'll see @ 13:19:04 I requested ovirt to power-off the VM (EL5) because it was not responding.  I can see logs on the VM up to that time, so it was not crashed or something.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c8)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2018-06-01 15:59:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kapetanakis Giannis from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c7)) > I have 2 kinds of machines but they behave the same: >  > 1) nodes of Dell PowerEdge R730: 2 x E5-2680 v4 > 2) nodes of IBM System x3650 M4: -[7915LRN]-: 2 x E5-2640 v2 > you want flags? >  > Migration is over 10G. vlan on top of bond (mode=1) master 10G / slave 1G > Storage is also iSCSI over that 10G bond interface. > Migration network is same as storage network (same vlan). > VMs run of different vlans.  OK, thanks for the info; nothing too unusual there - I've got a couple of e5-2620 v2's I can easily test on so that should be similar to your second box.

Yes I'm on CentOS. Didn't know you produce 4.x kernel for EL7 versions... I could test but that would not help locating the bug I guess...  Anyway, since you say you'll try reproduce.

Have you tried a fresh install on a -8xx vm - i.e. is it more general than a migration problem?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c12)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-02 21:57:49 UTC  ``` Almost positive I did, cause I setup a test VM to debug the problem in order not to delay production machines. No problem in install. My setup at that time was with 3.10.0-862.3.2 kernel.  I will try again tomorrow when I get to office and report back.  Use virtio devices with OpenBSD.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c13)  Kapetanakis Giannis    2018-06-04 09:17:53 UTC  ``` I did today an OpenBSD-6.3 install on top of 3.10.0-862.3.2 kernel.  No problems on installation (booted/install from cd iso)  Problems appear 100% every time I migrate TO a 3.10.0-862. node. If I migrate to a 3.10.0-693.21.1 kernel problems are resolved.  I also did a fresh install of CentOS 5.11 I couldn't NOT reproduce my problems with EL5.  I also did a snapshot-clone of a EL5 that was failing before and I could not reproduce it...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1584775#c14)  Dr. David Alan Gilbert    2018-06-04 11:59:18 UTC  ``` Yeh, I can recreate this here with both rhel5 and openbsd6.3. My simplest test is to have the guest run:    while true    do      date      sleep 10    done and/or  top  one or both of them stop updating after the migrate, even if other bits of the guest are apparently working.. Working with a -693 kernel, broken with -862.

# USN-3676-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

11 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused

a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1092](/security/CVE-2018-1092),

[CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-8087](/security/CVE-2018-8087))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly initialize the crc32c checksum driver. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-1094](/security/CVE-2018-1094))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr sizes. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1095](/security/CVE-2018-1095))

Jann Horn discovered that the 32 bit adjtimex() syscall implementation for

64 bit Linux kernels did not properly initialize memory returned to user

space in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-11508](/security/CVE-2018-11508))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3676-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

11 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3676-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused

a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1092](/security/CVE-2018-1092),

[CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

It was discovered that the cdrom driver in the Linux kernel contained an

incorrect bounds check. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-10940](/security/CVE-2018-10940))

It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-8087](/security/CVE-2018-8087))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
