Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied integer parameters in SQL queries. Although the application uses `real_escape_string()` to escape quotes, it fails to adequately handle integer parameters, making them vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   The application attempts to filter out SQL keywords like `union`, `create`, and `insert`, but these checks can be bypassed by URL encoding the payload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. The lack of proper input sanitization of integer parameters is the main weakness.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize user input, especially integer values, before using them in SQL queries.
*   **Bypassable Keyword Filter:** The application's attempt to filter out SQL keywords is ineffective because URL encoding can be used to bypass those filters.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which can lead to a range of malicious activities. This includes:
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Accessing and stealing sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Modifying or deleting database records.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining higher privileges within the application, depending on the database configuration and the commands executed.
    *   **Complete System Compromise:** In the worst case, could lead to complete compromise of the application and/or the underlying system, if database access permissions are not properly restricted.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through web requests.
*   **GET parameters:** The attack vector uses manipulated GET parameters in HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Network access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable system to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Basic knowledge of SQL and HTTP requests:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL syntax and how to craft HTTP requests.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in Dolibarr version 7.0.0 and is fixed in version 7.0.2.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to retrieve the database version using a crafted SQL injection payload within the `statut` parameter in `adherents/list.php`
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" with a CVSS v3 score of 9.8.
*   The provided code snippets show the inadequate escaping method and the flawed keyword filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sysdream Labs.
*   The fix involved changing the way the `statut` parameter is handled in `htdocs/adherents/list.php` file

This information clearly shows that CVE-2018-10094 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability due to improper handling of integer parameters, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
