  "CVE-2018-10907": {
    "description": "The provided data reveals a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in GlusterFS, specifically within the server-rpc-fops.c file. This overflow occurs due to functions allocating fixed-size buffers using `alloca(3)`. A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer than the buffer's capacity. This can lead to a crash or the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the allocation of fixed-size buffers on the stack using `alloca(3)` in the `server-rpc-fops.c` file. This fixed-size allocation does not account for potentially larger input strings leading to a buffer overflow when processing those strings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to fixed-size buffer allocation.",
       "Lack of proper input validation of string length."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (crash) or the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system. The impact is rated as 'Important' by Red Hat. The flaw affects glusterfs-server which is not shipped in RHEL 6 and 7.  It affects Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor, but is only exposed to hypervisor administrators in recommended configurations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack via a crafted string sent to a GlusterFS server after mounting the volume."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Requires an authenticated GlusterFS client to mount a volume.",
        "Ability to send a string exceeding the fixed buffer size to trigger the overflow."
    ],
