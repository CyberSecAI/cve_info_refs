  "CVE-2018-10873": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-120",
      "Description": "Frediano Ziglio reported a missing check in the script to generate demarshalling code in the SPICE protocol client and server library. The generated demarshalling code is prone to multiple buffer overflows. An authenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute arbitrary code.",
      "ID": "CVE-2018-10873",
      "References": [
        "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-10873",
        "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1596008",
        "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-common/commit/bb15d4815ab586b4c4a20f4a565970a44824c42c",

       ]
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "A missing check in the `demarshal.py` script when generating demarshalling code leads to missing bounds checks during message processing.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Multiple buffer overflows in the generated demarshalling code.",
         "Integer underflow may also trigger overflows"
      ],
      "Impact": "An authenticated attacker could cause a denial of service (spice server crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack vector": "By sending specially crafted messages over the network using the SPICE protocol.",
      "Required capabilities": "An authenticated attacker is required. The attacker needs to be a legitimate user of the SPICE service, or an attacker that has compromised a legitimate account. "
