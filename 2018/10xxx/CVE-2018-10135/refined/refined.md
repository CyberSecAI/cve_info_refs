{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'catid' parameter of the 'catwiseproducts.php' script before embedding it into the HTML output.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the 'catid' parameter in a GET request to the 'catwiseproducts.php' script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the application."
