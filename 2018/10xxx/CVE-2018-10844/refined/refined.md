{
    "CVE-2018-10844": {
        "Root cause": "The GnuTLS implementation of HMAC-SHA-256 was vulnerable to a Lucky Thirteen style attack due to not enough dummy compression function calls.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Timing side-channel vulnerability",
            "Insufficient padding implementation"
        ],
        "Impact": "Remote attackers could conduct distinguishing attacks and plain text recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data using crafted packets.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Network-based attacks using crafted packets",
             "Timing analysis of network traffic"
         ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
            "Ability to send crafted packets to the vulnerable service",
            "Ability to measure timing differences of the target"
          ],
          "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is a result of insufficient dummy function calls, making the implementation vulnerable to timing analysis."
    }
