RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The previous counter-measures had certain issues and were insufficient when the attacker had access to the CPU cache and performed a chosen-plaintext attack (CPA). \* Disabled the legacy `HMAC-SHA384` cipher suites by default. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-10-30 07:56:55 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

We notified the GnuTLS team of our > concerns about this on June 13th 2018. Our understanding is that the > GnuTLS team does not plan to address the issues, but prefers to > promote the use of Encrypt-then-MAC (as specified in RFC 7366) when > legacy cipher suites are required.  I noticed that Red Hat issued the three CVEs associated with that paper... Does the Red Hat security team have any insight on the approach that should be taken to fix those problems correctly?  Thanks,  A.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1582571#c12)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2018-10-01 07:03:12 UTC  ``` I do not speak for the red hat product security, however the upstream log indicates the fix:  > ** Improved counter-measures for TLS CBC record padding. Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen >   and Adi Shamir reported that the existing counter-measures had certain issues and >   were insufficient when the attacker has additional access to the CPU cache and  >   performs a chosen-plaintext attack. This affected the legacy CBC ciphersuites. [CVSS: medium]  > ** The ciphers utilizing HMAC-SHA384 and SHA256 have been removed from the default >   priority strings. They are not necessary for compatibility or other purpose and >   provide no advantage over their SHA1 counter-parts, as they all depend on the legacy >   TLS CBC block mode.  That is, the existing counter-measures present were improved to protect against this attack. Indeed the paper authors mention that this may not be sufficient to counter other future attacks, and they are correct in that. How critical however would be such future attacks? For that one must note what is the actual impact of this attack. This type of attacks does only affect the legacy HMAC-based ciphersuites  and only when the gnutls peer does not implement the encrypt-then-mac construction. That's why the majority of HMAC ciphersuites are now disabled by default keeping HMAC-SHA1 for compatibility only.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1582571#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:24:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3050 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3050](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3050)   ``` |  |

# USN-3999-1: GnuTLS vulnerabilities

30 May 2019

Several security issues were fixed in GnuTLS.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [gnutls28](/security/cves?package=gnutls28) - GNU TLS library

## Details

Eyal Ronen, Kenneth G. Paterson, and Adi Shamir discovered that GnuTLS was

vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the "Lucky Thirteen"

issue. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform

plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-10844](/security/CVE-2018-10844),

[CVE-2018-10845](/security/CVE-2018-10845), [CVE-2018-10846](/security/CVE-2018-10846))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled memory when

verifying certain X.509 certificates. A remote attacker could use this

issue to cause GnuTLS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 18.10, and Ubuntu 19.04. ([CVE-2019-3829](/security/CVE-2019-3829))

It was discovered that GnuTLS incorrectly handled certain post-handshake

messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause GnuTLS to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu 19.04. ([CVE-2019-3836](/security/CVE-2019-3836))

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Thanks,  A.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1582571#c12)  Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos    2018-10-01 07:03:12 UTC  ``` I do not speak for the red hat product security, however the upstream log indicates the fix:  > ** Improved counter-measures for TLS CBC record padding. Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen >   and Adi Shamir reported that the existing counter-measures had certain issues and >   were insufficient when the attacker has additional access to the CPU cache and  >   performs a chosen-plaintext attack. This affected the legacy CBC ciphersuites. [CVSS: medium]  > ** The ciphers utilizing HMAC-SHA384 and SHA256 have been removed from the default >   priority strings. They are not necessary for compatibility or other purpose and >   provide no advantage over their SHA1 counter-parts, as they all depend on the legacy >   TLS CBC block mode.  That is, the existing counter-measures present were improved to protect against this attack. Indeed the paper authors mention that this may not be sufficient to counter other future attacks, and they are correct in that. How critical however would be such future attacks? For that one must note what is the actual impact of this attack. This type of attacks does only affect the legacy HMAC-based ciphersuites  and only when the gnutls peer does not implement the encrypt-then-mac construction. That's why the majority of HMAC ciphersuites are now disabled by default keeping HMAC-SHA1 for compatibility only.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1582571#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:24:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3050 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3050](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3050)   ``` |  |

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: gnutls (3.3.29). (BZ#1561481)

Security Fix(es):

* gnutls: HMAC-SHA-256 vulnerable to Lucky thirteen attack due to not enough dummy function calls (CVE-2018-10844)
* gnutls: HMAC-SHA-384 vulnerable to Lucky thirteen attack due to use of wrong constant (CVE-2018-10845)
* gnutls: "Just in Time" PRIME + PROBE cache-based side channel attack can lead to plaintext recovery (CVE-2018-10846)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

#### Paper 2018/747

### Pseudo Constant Time Implementations of TLS Are Only Pseudo Secure

Eyal Ronen, Kenneth G. Paterson, and Adi Shamir

##### Abstract

Today, about 10% of TLS connections are still using CBC-mode cipher suites, despite a long history of attacks and the availability of better options (e.g. AES-GCM). In this work, we present three new types of attack against four popular fully patched implementations
of TLS (Amazon's s2n, GnuTLS, mbed TLS and wolfSSL) which elected to use ``pseudo constant time'' countermeasures against the Lucky 13 attack on CBC-mode. Our attacks combine several variants of the PRIME+PROBE cache timing technique with a new extension of the original Lucky 13 attack. They apply in a cross-VM attack setting and are capable of recovering most of the plaintext whilst requiring only a moderate number of TLS connections. Along the way, we uncovered additional serious (but easy to patch) bugs in all four of the TLS implementations that we studied; in three cases, these bugs lead to Lucky 13 style attacks that can be mounted remotely with no access to a shared cache. Our work shows that adopting pseudo constant time countermeasures is not sufficient to attain real security in TLS implementations in CBC mode.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-08-21 05:44:53 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-08-21 05:44:59 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1582571,1619511  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:03:17 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-04-29 14:25:26 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-f90fb78f70 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-f90fb78f70>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-04-29 14:26:05 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-d14280a6e8 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d14280a6e8>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1619511#c5)  Fedora Update System    2020-04-30 04:13:40 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-f90fb78f70 has been pushed to the Fedora 32 testing repository.

Package        : gnutls28
Version        : 3.3.30-0+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10844 CVE-2018-10845 CVE-2018-10846

A set of vulnerabilities was discovered in GnuTLS which allowed
attackers to do plain text recovery on TLS connections with certain
cipher types.

CVE-2018-10844

    It was found that the GnuTLS implementation of HMAC-SHA-256 was
    vulnerable to a Lucky thirteen style attack. Remote attackers
    could use this flaw to conduct distinguishing attacks and
    plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data
    using crafted packets.

CVE-2018-10845

    It was found that the GnuTLS implementation of HMAC-SHA-384 was
    vulnerable to a Lucky thirteen style attack. Remote attackers
    could use this flaw to conduct distinguishing attacks and plain
    text recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data
    using crafted packets.

CVE-2018-10846

    A cache-based side channel in GnuTLS implementation that leads to
    plain text recovery in cross-VM attack setting was found. An
    attacker could use a combination of "Just in Time" Prime+probe
    attack in combination with Lucky-13 attack to recover plain text
    using crafted packets.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.3.30-0+deb8u1. It was found to be more practical to update to the
latest upstream version of the 3.3.x branch since upstream's fixes
were rather invasive and required cipher list changes anyways. This
will facilitate future LTS updates as well.

This change therefore also includes the following major policy
changes, as documented in the NEWS file:

   * ARCFOUR (RC4) and SSL 3.0 are no longer included in the default
     priorities list. Those have to be explicitly enabled, e.g., with
     a string like "NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128" or "NORMAL:+VERS-SSL3.0",
     respectively.

   * The ciphers utilizing HMAC-SHA384 and SHA256 have been removed
     from the default priority strings. They are not necessary for
     compatibility or other purpose and provide no advantage over
     their SHA1 counter-parts, as they all depend on the legacy TLS
     CBC block mode.

   * Follow closely RFC5280 recommendations and use UTCTime for dates
     prior to 2050.

   * Require strict DER encoding for certificates, OCSP requests,
     private keys, CRLs and certificate requests, in order to reduce
     issues due to the complexity of BER rules.

   * Refuse to import v1 or v2 certificates that contain extensions.

API and ABI compatibility is retained, however, although new symbols
have been added. Many bugfixes are also included in the upload. See
the provided upstream changelog for more details.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages and do not expect
significant breakage.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
