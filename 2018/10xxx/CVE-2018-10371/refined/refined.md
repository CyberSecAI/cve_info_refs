Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "WF Cookie Consent" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize the page title when it is retrieved from the database and displayed on the plugin's settings page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to persistent XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page title, which is then stored in the WordPress database. When an administrator navigates to the plugin's settings page, this stored code is executed in the administrator's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser, which can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies, session tokens, and credentials
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious actions by impersonating the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated attacker with the capability to create or edit pages in the WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least the ability to create/edit pages (e.g. contributor role or higher).
- The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details:**

1.  **Injection Point:** The vulnerable code is injected into the title field of a WordPress page.
2.  **Persistence:** The injected code is stored in the WordPress database with the page information.
3.  **Execution:** The stored malicious script is executed when an administrator views the settings page for the "WF Cookie Consent" plugin. The plugin retrieves the page title from the database and includes it in the HTML output without proper sanitization, causing the browser to execute the embedded Javascript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that version 1.1.3 of the WF Cookie Consent plugin is vulnerable, and older versions might also be affected.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the developer but there was no response.
*   The recommended remediation is to use a web application firewall or uninstall the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is in the plugin's settings page.
