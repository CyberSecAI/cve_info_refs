# USN-3678-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

12 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused

a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1092](/security/CVE-2018-1092))

It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-8087](/security/CVE-2018-8087))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1009-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.15.0-1009.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.15.0-1009.9)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-1010-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1010.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1010.10)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-1011-kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-kvm)
  -
  [4.15.0-1011.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-kvm/4.15.0-1011.11)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-23-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-23.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-23.25)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-23-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-23.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-23.25)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-23-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-23.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-23.25)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-23-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-23.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-23.25)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

When ata device doing EH, some commands still attached with tasks are
not passed to libata when abort failed or recover failed, so libata did
not handle these commands. After these commands done, sas task is freed,
but ata qc is not freed. This will cause ata qc leak and trigger a
warning like below:

If ata qc leaked too many, ata tag allocation will fail and io blocked
for ever.

As suggested by Dan Williams, defer ata device commands to libata and
merge sas_eh_finish_cmd() with sas_eh_defer_cmd(). libata will handle
ata qcs correctly after this.

# USN-3678-2: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

12 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused

a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1092](/security/CVE-2018-1092))

It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-8087](/security/CVE-2018-8087))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

# USN-3678-3: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

12 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 file system that caused

a denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1092](/security/CVE-2018-1092))

It was discovered that the 802.11 software simulator implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a memory leak when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2018-8087](/security/CVE-2018-8087))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

  [4.15.0-1012.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.15.0-1012.13)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the perf subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18255](/security/CVE-2017-18255))

Wei Fang discovered an integer overflow in the F2FS filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18257](/security/CVE-2017-18257))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that the wait4() system call in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10087](/security/CVE-2018-10087))

It was discovered that the kill() system call implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2018-10124](/security/CVE-2018-10124))

Julian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states

(such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are

potentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-3665](/security/CVE-2018-3665))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in

the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address

locations). ([CVE-2017-13695](/security/CVE-2017-13695))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3696-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the perf subsystem of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18255](/security/CVE-2017-18255))

Wei Fang discovered an integer overflow in the F2FS filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18257](/security/CVE-2017-18257))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that the wait4() system call in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10087](/security/CVE-2018-10087))

It was discovered that the kill() system call implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate its arguments in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2018-10124](/security/CVE-2018-10124))

Julian Stecklina and Thomas Prescher discovered that FPU register states

(such as MMX, SSE, and AVX registers) which are lazily restored are

potentially vulnerable to a side channel attack. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-3665](/security/CVE-2018-3665))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-7755](/security/CVE-2018-7755))

Seunghun Han discovered an information leak in the ACPI handling code in

the Linux kernel when handling early termination of ACPI table loading. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive informal (kernel address

locations). ([CVE-2017-13695](/security/CVE-2017-13695))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1024-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 860900 872907 892057 896775 897590 898137

Linux 4.9 has been packaged for Debian 8 as linux-4.9.  This provides
a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use kernel
packages from the "jessie-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 3.16, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    hyperv-daemons libcpupower1 libcpupower-dev libusbip-dev
    linux-compiler-gcc-4.9-x86 linux-cpupower linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from other source packages
in Debian 8.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-18255

    It was discovered that the performance events subsystem did not
    properly validate the value of the
    kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent sysctl.  Setting a large value
    could have an unspecified security impact.  However, only a
    privileged user can set this sysctl.

CVE-2018-1118

    The syzbot software found that the vhost driver did not initialise
    message buffers which would later be read by user processes.  A
    user with access to the /dev/vhost-net device could use this to
    read sensitive information from the kernel or other users'
    processes.

CVE-2018-1120

    Qualys reported that a user able to mount FUSE filesystems can
    create a process such that when another process attempting to read
    its command line will be blocked for an arbitrarily long time.
    This could be used for denial of service, or to aid in exploiting
    a race condition in the other program.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3639

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context.  In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox.  This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update allows the issue to be mitigated on some x86
    processors by disabling SSB.  This requires an update to the
    processor's microcode, which is non-free.  It may be included in
    an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a future
    update to the intel-microcode or amd64-microcode packages.

    Disabling SSB can reduce performance significantly, so by default
    it is only done in tasks that use the seccomp feature.
    Applications that require this mitigation should request it
    explicitly through the prctl() system call.  Users can control
    where the mitigation is enabled with the spec_store_bypass_disable
    kernel parameter.

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-10021

    A physically present attacker who unplugs a SAS cable can cause a
    denial of service (memory leak and WARN).

CVE-2018-10087, CVE-2018-10124

    zhongjiang found that the wait4() and kill() system call
    implementations did not check for the invalid pid value of
    INT_MIN.  If a user passed this value, the behaviour of the code
    was formally undefined and might have had a security impact.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10876, CVE-2018-10877, CVE-2018-10878, CVE-2018-10879,
CVE-2018-10880, CVE-2018-10881, CVE-2018-10882, CVE-2018-10883

    Wen Xu at SSLab, Gatech, reported that crafted ext4 filesystem
    images could trigger a crash or memory corruption.  A local user
    able to mount arbitrary filesystems, or an attacker providing
    filesystems to be mounted, could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-1~deb8u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#860900, #872907, #892057, #896775, #897590, and #898137; and
includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.89-4.9.110
inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.
