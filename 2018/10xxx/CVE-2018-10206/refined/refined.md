  "CVE-2018-10206": {
    "Description": "Security issue affecting the product Vaultize. There is Stored XSS via the optional message field of a file request.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization on the message field of a file request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the message field. When other users view this message, the injected scripts execute in their browser, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
     "Attack vector": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create a file request with a malicious payload within the message field. This likely means the attacker needs a valid, although potentially low-privileged, account on the affected Vaultize system."
