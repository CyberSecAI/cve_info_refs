{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GnuTLS implementation of HMAC-SHA-384 used an incorrect constant during the length encoding process, making it vulnerable to a Lucky Thirteen style attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from a timing side-channel vulnerability related to the use of CBC mode with HMAC-SHA-384 where an incorrect constant made the padding process predictable",
     "The core issue is that the implementation didn't properly mask the timing differences during the MAC verification step, which is exploited by the Lucky 13 attack."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform distinguishing attacks and recover plaintext by statistically analyzing timing data from crafted packets.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via crafted TLS packets",
      "Timing analysis of the TLS connection to reveal information"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send crafted TLS packets to a vulnerable server.",
      "Capability to measure timing differences in network traffic."
