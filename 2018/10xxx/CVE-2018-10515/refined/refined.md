{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'file unpack' operation in the admin dashboard of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) <= 2.2.7 does not validate the contents of the uploaded zip archive. It directly extracts files from the archive without any checks, allowing an attacker to include malicious files, such as a .php file, which could be executed after extraction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of file type validation during zip archive extraction.",
      "Direct extraction of files from archive to server directory."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution by uploading a zip file containing a malicious php file which gets executed once extracted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Admin user uploads a specially crafted zip file containing malicious .php file using the 'file unpack' functionality within the CMSMS admin dashboard."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be logged in as an admin user on the CMSMS admin dashboard in order to exploit this vulnerability."
