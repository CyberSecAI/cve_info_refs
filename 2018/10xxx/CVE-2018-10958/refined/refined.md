      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "A large size value may lead to a SIGABRT during an attempt at memory allocation within the `Exiv2::DataBuf::alloc` function, specifically when `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::zlibUncompress` is called.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Memory exhaustion",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "Impact": "The vulnerability results in a program crash (SIGABRT) due to a `std::bad_alloc` exception, leading to a denial of service.",
      "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted image file (PNG).",
       "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious PNG file that causes a large memory allocation request."
