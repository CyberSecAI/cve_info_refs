Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an untrusted search path issue (CWE-426).  ALZip, prior to version 10.76, searches for and loads DLL files from predictable locations without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Untrusted Search Path:** The application loads DLL files from specific directories (`%PROGRAMFILES%\ESTsoft\ALZip\Formats`, `%PROGRAMFILES%\ESTsoft\ALZip\Coders`, `%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\ESTsoft\ALZip\Formats`, or `%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\ESTsoft\ALZip\Coders`) without verifying their legitimacy. This allows an attacker to introduce malicious DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a specially crafted malicious DLL file in one of the vulnerable directories, a local attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running ALZip.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where ALZip is installed.
- **Malicious DLL Placement:** The attacker must create a malicious DLL and place it in one of the specified directories:
    -  `C:\Program Files\ESTsoft\ALZip\Formats\`
    - `C:\Program Files\ESTsoft\ALZip\Coders\`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\ESTsoft\ALZip\Formats\`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)\ESTsoft\ALZip\Coders\`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the ALZip installation directory.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Additional Information:**

- The affected versions of ALZip are 10.75.0.0 and below.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) is available at `https://srvlin.kr/poc/mal_x86.zip`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by KwangHyung Lee of EQST Lab, SKinfosec.
- There is a reference to a related notice on the ALTools website: `https://www.altools.co.kr/Support/Notice_Contents.aspx?idx=1640&page=1&t=2`
