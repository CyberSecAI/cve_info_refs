The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MiniCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because user-supplied input for the `site_link` parameter within the `/mc-admin/conf.php` page is not properly sanitized before being stored and later displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when the page containing the vulnerable input is accessed.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `site_link` parameter before saving it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page.
- Session hijacking: The attacker could steal cookies or other sensitive information, potentially gaining control of the victim's session.
- Redirect to malicious sites, or perform other client-side attacks.
- Execute arbitrary commands on the client system using the ActiveXObject.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/MiniCMS-master/MiniCMS-master/mc-admin/conf.php` with malicious code injected into the `site_link` parameter.
- Requires the user to access the vulnerable page where the injected code is displayed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the admin configuration page at `/mc-admin/conf.php`.
- Ability to manipulate the `site_link` parameter within the POST request.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the configuration.
