{
  "CVE-2018-10728": {
    "Root cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when handling crafted cookies within GET requests to menu_pxc.cgi or index.cgi.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-119, CWE-121)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service (disabling Web and Telnet services) and arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted cookie within a GET request to the affected CGI scripts (menu_pxc.cgi or index.cgi) of the web interface.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication and can trigger the vulnerability remotely.  Originally reported as high attack complexity, the complexity was later changed to low due to the way the vulnerability was discovered."
