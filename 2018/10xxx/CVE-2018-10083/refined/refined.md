The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple, including CVE-2018-10083. Here's the breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2018-10083:

**CVE-2018-10083: Any file deletion in the admin dashboard (<=2.2.7)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `cwd` and `val` parameters, within the FilePicker module's AJAX command handler.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The `cwd` parameter, intended to represent the current working directory, is only sanitized to remove `<>` characters. It does not prevent path traversal sequences like `../`.
    *   **Insufficient Directory Validation:** The `is_relative_to` function compares the provided `cwd` against the default uploads directory. However, by using `../` in the `val` parameter, attackers can specify paths outside the intended directory to be deleted.
    *   **Unprotected File Deletion:** The `del` command within the AJAX handler directly calls the unlink function with a user controlled path to delete a file.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary file deletion on the server. An attacker can delete any file accessible to the web server user, potentially leading to website malfunction, data loss, and denial of service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in `/modules/FilePicker/action.ajax_cmd.php`, which is accessible to authenticated administrative users.
    *   Attackers can send a crafted POST request with the `cmd` parameter set to `del`, the `cwd` parameter to specify a starting directory (usually /uploads/), and the `val` parameter containing the path of the file to delete, including path traversal sequences like `../`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have a valid administrator account on the CMS Made Simple application.
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Summary:** The core issue is that the FilePicker module doesn't properly validate user supplied path information, allowing an attacker to use `../` sequences to traverse out of the intended directories and delete arbitrary files. This can be done through an authenticated admin user account.
