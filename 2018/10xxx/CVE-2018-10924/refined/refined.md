Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the GlusterFS client code when the `fsync(2)` system call is invoked. Specifically, the functions `gf_common_mt_memdup` and `gf_common_mt_char` are implicated in the leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak that occurs with each `fsync(2)` call. This means that memory is allocated but not freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to exhaust the memory of the host machine running a GlusterFS client, leading to a denial of service. By repeatedly calling `fsync(2)`, the attacker can force the GlusterFS client to consume all available memory, thus rendering the system unresponsive or causing it to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be launched remotely over the network, likely by making requests that trigger the `fsync(2)` system call within the GlusterFS client.
- **GlusterFS FUSE Client:** The vulnerability is located in the GlusterFS FUSE client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to interact with the GlusterFS system. Specifically, they require the ability to trigger `fsync(2)` calls on the client.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the GlusterFS server and client in order to make the necessary requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in GlusterFS versions 3.12.11 and 3.12.12.
- The issue was not reproducible in GlusterFS version 3.8.x, indicating the problem was introduced in later versions.
- Patches for this vulnerability have been released in glusterfs versions 3.12.14 and 4.1.4.
- The vulnerability does not affect versions of glusterfs shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.
-  The openSUSE security update `openSUSE-SU-2020:0079-1` addresses this issue.
- The fix was applied upstream in commit `https://review.gluster.org/20723`.
