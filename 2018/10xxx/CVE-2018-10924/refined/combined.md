| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-02 17:58:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Gluster 3.12.11 and 3.12.12 FUSE client. The fsync(2) system call appears to directly or indirectly leak memory in "gf_common_mt_memdup" and "gf_common_mt_char" functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerablity to perform a Denial of Service attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-02 17:59:04 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-16 02:06:21 UTC  ``` This memory leak does not appear to be reproducible on glusterfs-3.8.x.  The FUSE interface changed significantly between 3.8 and 3.12.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c4)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-04 05:43:53 UTC  ``` Created glusterfs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1625078](show_bug.cgi?id=1625078 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-10924 glusterfs: Denial-of-service via fsync(2) in Gluster FUSE client [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c6)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-04 09:07:08 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <https://review.gluster.org/20723>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1611785#c7)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-04 13:34:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of glusterfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.   ``` |  |
