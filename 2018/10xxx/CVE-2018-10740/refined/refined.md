The provided content describes a vulnerability in axublogcms version 1.1.0, specifically a code execution vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `setconfig.php` file within the administrative panel of axublogcms. The application directly uses the submitted `webkeywords` parameter to overwrite the corresponding variable in the `cmsconfig.php` file without any sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or escape the user-supplied `webkeywords` parameter.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By injecting malicious PHP code into the `webkeywords` parameter, an attacker can overwrite the contents of the `cmsconfig.php` file.
- **Code Injection:** The overwritten `cmsconfig.php` file is then included directly in the application, leading to the execution of the injected code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting axublogcms.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control over the web server, including data access, modification, and further attacks on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/ad/setconfig.php` with malicious PHP code injected into the `webkeywords` parameter.
- **Backstage (Admin Panel):** The vulnerability exists in the administrative area, requiring the attacker to access the backend of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Admin Access or Ability to Reach the setconfig.php:** The attacker must either have valid admin credentials or be able to somehow bypass authentication and reach `setconfig.php`
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability in `setconfig.php`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `./ad/setconfig.php`.
- The `webkeywords` parameter is directly inserted into the `cmsconfig.php` file without any validation.
- The `cmsconfig.php` file is included directly in the application.
- An example payload provided is `123456 "; @eval($_POST['a']); $a="`, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code through a POST parameter 'a'.
