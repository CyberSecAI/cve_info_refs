Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10091:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the CGI interface of AudioCodes 400HD series IP phones, specifically in the `mainform.cgi` script. User inputs in various fields are not protected against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS (CWE-79):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into user input fields is stored and executed when the page is loaded by other users, or by the same user at a later time.
- Specifically, the fields `Name`, `Office`, `Home`, and `Mobile` on the `Directory` page are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This allows an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Modify the displayed content
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, requiring network access to the web interface of the affected IP phone.
- An attacker injects a malicious script, such as `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`, into a vulnerable input field through the web interface.
- When the page is displayed, the injected script executes in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the IP phone's web interface.
- The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to access the vulnerable `Directory` page where the contact details are stored.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on the AudioCodes 420HD phone with firmware version 2.2.12.126.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 17/04/2018 and was publicly disclosed on 10/01/2019.
- AudioCodes allegedly fixed the issue in version 2.2.16.128, but testing performed by the researchers found that this release did not mitigate the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 5.5, with vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:H/RC:C
