Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of data over a WebSocket.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for client-side code execution with the target user's privileges. While the confidentiality and availability impacts are none, the integrity impact is high because an attacker could potentially modify the behavior of the user's interaction with the application.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N) with low complexity (AC:L). No privileges are required (PR:N) but the user must interact with the malicious input (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to inject malicious data via the WebSocket interface. No special position within the network is required, just network access to the vulnerable system. The attacker needs to rely on user interaction.
