## 5. MITIGATIONS

Martem has provided updated information within the “Security Considerations” section of their Configuration Manual which can be accessed at following link:

<http://phobos.martem.ee/shr/dsum/Telem-GWS_usermanual.pdf>

Martem recommends the following mitigations for CVE-2018-10603 and CVE-2018-10607:

In most cases, these vulnerabilities can be resolved by proper configuration:

* Using "other side IP" field in RTU configuration for every TCP/IP channel. This will minimize the risk of allowing unauthorized access and control over the communication channels (i.e., only trusted partners are allowed);
* Using secure VPN channels;
* Proper packet filtering by enabling firewall in RTU configuration. Note that the "interface" field of every communication channel must be properly set in RTU configuration when firewall is enabled.

See Martem Security Advisory SA1805182 and SA1805184:

<http://martem.eu/csa/Martem_CSA_Telem_1805182.pdf>

<http://martem.eu/csa/Martem_CSA_Telem_1805184.pdf>

**--------- Begin Update B Part 5 of 5 --------**

Martem recommends the following mitigations for CVE-2018-10605:

* Upgrade to new firmware release 2.0.87-4018403- k4 or newer
* Change default passwords to reasonably strong ones.
* Implement firewall rules to limit unsanctioned SSH access for IPv4 and IPv6.
* Use SSH public key authorization.
* Ensure GWS.exe is up to date.

See Martem Security Advisory SA1805183:

<https://martem.eu/csa/Martem_CSA_Telem_1805183.pdf>

Martem recommends the following mitigations for CVE-2018-10609:

* Upgrade to firmware 2.0.72-cb42e64-k4 or newer. Contact Martem for more information.

**--------- End Update B Part 5 of 5 --------**

* WebServer should be turned on according to need of the configurator. If the WebServer is not needed anymore, then it should be removed from the configuration.
* WebServer access should be protected by strong password to avoid unauthorized access. Other side IP should be defined in configuration. Use firewall to avoid untrusted connections and to restrict the number of parallel connections to the WebServer.

See Martem Security Advisory SA1805181:

<http://martem.eu/csa/Martem_CSA_Telem_1805181.pdf>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
