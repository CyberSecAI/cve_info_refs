- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application logs not found URLs to a file (`logs/note_found.log`). This file is loaded into RAM each time an invalid URL is accessed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unbounded logging of unique invalid URLs to a file.
    - Loading the entire log file into RAM on every request for a non-existing URL.
    - Lack of input validation/rate limiting for logging.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can send numerous unique invalid URLs to the application, causing the log file to grow excessively.
    - Increased memory consumption: Loading this large file into RAM on each request exhausts server resources.
    - Increased I/O load: Reading the large log file from disk.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending multiple requests with unique invalid URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
