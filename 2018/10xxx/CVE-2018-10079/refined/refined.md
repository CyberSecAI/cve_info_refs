Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-10079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure file permissions on the configuration data directory of the Geist WatchDog Console application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The WatchDog Console 3.2.2 installs configuration data at `C:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console` and grants the "Authenticated Users" group "Modify" permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local users can modify configuration files, such as `config.xml` and `servers.xml`.
-  This allows attackers to:
    - Reset the application admin password by generating a password using the PHP md5() function and updating the `config.xml` file.
    - Add data to `servers.xml`, which can facilitate other attacks like XSS (CVE-2018-10078) and potentially XXE (CVE-2018-10077) by adding malicious server entries.
    - Add/modify server configurations for monitoring

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the system with a low-privileged user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to a system where WatchDog Console is installed and running.
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the application granting excessive permissions to the "Authenticated Users" group on its configuration directory.
- This allows any local user to modify critical configuration files.
