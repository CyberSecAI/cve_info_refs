# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c0)  Scott Gayou    2018-07-31 21:17:17 UTC  ``` ttembed fails to validate file bounds before reading and seeking in the input file. This can lead to an integer overflow and the corruption of the input file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c1)  Scott Gayou    2018-07-31 21:18:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Scott Gayou (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c4)  Scott Gayou    2018-08-02 15:45:15 UTC  ``` Unembargoed due to very low impact. Upstream notified.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c5)  Scott Gayou    2018-08-02 15:48:56 UTC  ``` Created ttembed tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1611686](show_bug.cgi?id=1611686 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2018-10921 ttembed: failure to check file bounds may lead to input file corruption [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c7)  Scott Gayou    2018-08-02 16:15:06 UTC  ``` Upstream Issue:  <https://github.com/hisdeedsaredust/ttembed/issues/3>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1610539#c8)  Scott Gayou    2018-08-02 16:26:46 UTC  ``` Note the following:  unsigned long readbe32(FILE *f) {     unsigned long v;     v  = fgetc(f) << 24;     v |= fgetc(f) << 16;     v |= fgetc(f) << 8;     v |= fgetc(f);     return v; }  readbe32 should be checking for EOF. The application fails to verify that reads will succeed via ensuring minimum file-lengths. Instead, it blindly reads and fails to check that EOF is not returned. As such, large negative values are returned by readbe32.  One obvious case occurs on line 49 where fstype is set to the output of readbe32. If no more bytes can be read from the file handle, readbe32 will return -1. A fseek on line 51 adds 8 to -1, which wraps around to an fseek of 7, which is valid. This later leads to incorrect writes and "corruption" of the input file.  All usages of fgetc should be checked else file bounds should be verified before fseeks/fgetcs are called.   ``` |  |

# CVE-2018-10921 Failure to Check File Bounds May Lead to Input File Corruption #3

## Description

[![@sgayou](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20627117?u=458703ca235114e71d8243ee30bd63f524cfc33f&v=4&size=48)](/sgayou)[sgayou](https://github.com/sgayou)opened [on Aug 2, 2018](https://github.com/hisdeedsaredust/ttembed/issues/3#issue-347067436)

Certain input files may trigger an integer overflow in ttembed input file processing. This overflow could potentially lead to corruption of the input file due to a lack of checking return codes of fgetc/fputc function calls.

ttembed fails to check the return of fgetc for failures which can lead to output file corruption.

Note the following:

```
unsigned long readbe32(FILE *f)
{
    unsigned long v;
    v  = fgetc(f) << 24;
    v |= fgetc(f) << 16;
    v |= fgetc(f) << 8;
    v |= fgetc(f);
    return v;
}
```

readbe32 should be checking for EOF. The application fails to verify that reads will succeed via ensuring minimum file-lengths.

Instead, it blindly reads and fails to check that EOF is not returned. As such, large negative values are returned by readbe32.

One obvious case occurs on line 49 where fstype is set to the output of readbe32. If no more bytes can be read from the file handle,

readbe32 will return -1. A fseek on line 51 adds 8 to -1, which wraps around to an fseek of 7, which is valid. This later leads to incorrect writes and "corruption" of the input file.

All usages of fgetc should be checked else file bounds should be verified before fseeks/fgetcs are called.

The security implications of this seem rather unimportant as an attacker submitting a corrupted file and the application further corrupting it seems rather obtuse, but perhaps some consumer downstream of ttembed may rely on correct files being output. Nevertheless, ttembed should still terminate early in this case before writing.

Reproducer attached. Copy modify.ttf to modify.bak, run ttembed on modify.ttf, then diff the file and the bak. They will be different.
