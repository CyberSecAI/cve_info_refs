{
  "CVE-2018-10880": {
    "vulnerability": "A stack-out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem code in the `ext4_update_inline_data()` function.",
    "root cause": "When expanding the extra isize space of an inode, the `system.data` extended attribute (xattr) could be moved out of the inode body, which is not expected by the inline data implementation. This leads to the stack-out-of-bounds write when the code attempts to access the `system.data` xattr.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of extended attributes.",
        "Lack of sufficient bounds checking when updating inline data."
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can mount and write to a crafted ext4 image could cause a system crash and a denial of service.",
    "attack vector": "Mounting and writing to a specially crafted ext4 image.",
    "attacker capabilities": "Requires the ability to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem image, typically requiring privileged access (root or similar capabilities), though a regular user might be tricked into doing so on a desktop system by inserting a malicious USB drive.",
    "additional details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by enabling the `inline_data` feature on an ext4 filesystem, which is not enabled by default. A malicious filesystem image can cause a crash, and a fix was implemented to prevent the `system.data` xattr from being moved out of the inode."
