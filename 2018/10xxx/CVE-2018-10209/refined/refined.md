{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization when handling file or folder names, specifically within the context of the file/folder download pop-up in Vaultize.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the file or folder names, which is then stored by the system. When a user interacts with a file/folder download pop-up, this stored XSS payload gets executed in their browser. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of the user, leading to data theft or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious file or folder name containing XSS payload." ,
      "The attacker uploads a file/folder with the malicious name.",
      "A user triggers the download pop-up (by attempting a download of the file or folder)",
      "The stored XSS payload in the file/folder name gets executed within the victim's browser."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to upload or create files or folders with custom names on the Vaultize platform, which requires a valid user account with write access.",
   "cvss": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
