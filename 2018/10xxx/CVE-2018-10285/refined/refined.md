Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Ericsson-LG iPECS NMS A.1Ac web application has incorrect access control mechanisms. It does not implement proper session management, lacking any session IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application fails to properly authenticate and authorize users, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functionality. Specifically, the lack of session IDs allows for bypassing authentication.
*   **Cleartext Credential Storage:** Although not the primary focus of CVE-2018-10285, the associated exploit reveals that the application stores database and NMS login credentials in cleartext, which can be extracted due to the access control issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information, including database credentials and NMS admin credentials, due to the combination of lack of access controls and cleartext storage.
*   **System Compromise:**  With the extracted credentials, attackers can potentially gain full control over the iPECS NMS system and, potentially, the managed iPECS network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses HTTP POST requests to interact with the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the iPECS NMS server.
*   **Basic HTTP Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
*   **No Authentication:**  The primary weakness allows the attacker to bypass authentication, so no valid credentials are needed initially.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates a sequence of actions: It first performs an SQL injection to bypass the login, then uses the access control vulnerability to extract database credentials, and then uses the database credentials to retrieve admin credentials for the NMS system. The SQLi is not the main vulnerability covered by this CVE, but it is a prerequisite for the credential dump in the exploit script.
*   The vulnerability impacts iPECS NMS version A.1Ac and possibly earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Berk Cem Goksel.

In summary, CVE-2018-10285 describes a significant vulnerability in the Ericsson-LG iPECS NMS application stemming from a lack of proper access controls. This, combined with cleartext credential storage, creates a severe risk of unauthorized access and potential compromise of managed systems.
