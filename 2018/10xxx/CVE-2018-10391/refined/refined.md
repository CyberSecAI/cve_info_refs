The provided content relates to CVE-2018-10391.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `email` parameter during the member registration process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the system through the email parameter during registration. When an administrator views the personal information of the affected user in the backend, the malicious script executes. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
* Stealing administrator session cookies.
* Defacing the administrative interface.
* Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a POST request to the `index.php?m=member&v=register` endpoint, with a specially crafted email parameter containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the server.
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
* The attacker exploits this during the registration process of a new user account.
* An administrator must later view the profile of the compromised user to trigger the injected JavaScript.
