> A xss vulnerability was discovered in WUZHI CMS 4.1.0
>
> There is a persistent XSS attacks vulnerability which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the **`email`** parameter post to the **`index.php?m=member&v=register`**
>
> When the background administrator inquires about the personal information of this ordinary member, XSS triggers successfully.

**`POC`**
