# Exploit Title: Wordpress Responsive Cookie Consent 1.7 / 1.6 / 1.5 - Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
# Date: 2018-04-20
# Exploit Author: B0UG
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.jameskoussertari.co.uk/
# Software Link: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-cookie-consent/
# Version: Tested on version 1.5 / 1.6 /1.7 (older versions may also be affected)
# Tested on: WordPress
# Category : Webapps
# CVE: CVE-2018-10309

#I. VULNERABILITY

Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

#II. BACKGROUND
Responsive Cookie Consent is open source software kindly developed by James Koussertari to display cookie consent notifications on a WordPress website.

#III. DESCRIPTION
A authenticated persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability has been found in the web interface of the plugin that allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code to be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the web site.

#IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
1) Access WordPress control panel.
2) Navigate to the Responsive Cookie Consent plugin page.
3) Select one of the input fields. For example, "Cookie Bar Border Bottom Size".
4) Insert the script you wish to inject.
5) Save the plugin settings.
6) Injected script will run in the victim's browser. Depending on which input field you inserted the script, the script may also run everytime you load the Responsive Cookie Consent plugin page.

#V. IMPACT
An attacker can execute malicious code in a victim's browser to perform various activities such as stealing cookies, session tokens, credentials and personal data amongst others.

#VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
WordPress websites running "Responsive Cookie Consent" plugin version 1.5 (older versions may also be affected).

#VII. REMEDIATION
Update to the latest version available. Implement a web application such as Wordfence.

#VIII. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE
#February 8, 2018 1: Vulnerability identified.
#February 8, 2018 2: Informed developer of the vulnerability.
#February 8, 2018 2: Developer acknowledged the vulnerability.
#February 10, 2018 2: Developer issued a security patch.
#February 12, 2018 2: Informed developer of further vulnerabilities.
#February 13, 2018 2: Developer issued a further two security patches.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
