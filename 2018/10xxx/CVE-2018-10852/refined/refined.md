{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UNIX pipe used by sudo to communicate with SSSD had overly permissive access controls, allowing any local user to send messages using the same protocol and read sudo rules.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak due to insecure permissions on the communication pipe between sudo and sssd.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could read sudo rules for any user, gaining knowledge of which commands they have sudo privileges for, potentially enabling privilege escalation attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is needed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to send a message using the raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system and have the ability to communicate with the sssd-sudo responder via the exposed pipe."
