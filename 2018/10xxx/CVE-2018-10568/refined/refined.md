```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the URL, leading to the injection of malicious script code.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to theft of confidential information (e.g., session cookies, credentials, personal data) or loss of control of the PC.
- Attack vectors:  The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL, specifically by injecting malicious javascript in the URL parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a user to visit this URL. This attack can be performed remotely.
