Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Little Snitch versions 4.0 to 4.0.6 not properly verifying cryptographic signatures of executables, specifically fat/universal binaries.
- These versions fail to pass the `kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures` flag to the `SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors()` function provided by macOS's Security.framework.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature:** Little Snitch incorrectly assesses the validity of code signatures in fat/universal binaries.
- **Incomplete Architecture Checks:** The lack of the `kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures` flag means that not all architectures within a fat binary are checked for valid signatures, leading to potential bypasses.
- **Misleading UI:** The Little Snitch Configuration and Network Monitor would erroneously display that the on-disk code signature is valid even when it was not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Misleading Information:** The primary impact is that Little Snitch can be tricked into displaying a code signature as valid when it is not, due to the incomplete checks.
- **Bypass Security Tools**: This vulnerability could be leveraged to bypass other security tools that rely on code-signing checks. (See okta.com blog post)
- **Confusion:** Users may be confused by the inaccurate validation results displayed by Little Snitch.
- **Potential for further compromise** Although the Little Snitch kernel extension correctly treats the running processâ€™ code signature as not valid, other security tools that rely on the code signing APIs for malware detection can be bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Fat Binary:** An attacker crafts a fat/universal binary containing both a valid Apple-signed binary and a malicious, ad-hoc signed binary.
- **Exploiting API Weakness:** The vulnerability leverages the fact that the code signing API, when used improperly, only checks the first architecture in the binary and doesn't enforce root-of-trust checks on subsequent architectures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Fat Binaries:** The attacker must be able to create fat/universal binaries, which involves combining multiple Mach-O executables for different architectures into one file.
- **Ad-Hoc Signing:** The attacker needs to be able to ad-hoc sign the malicious code within the fat binary. This can be done using the `codesign` tool.
- **No Elevated Privileges Required:** This vulnerability does not require any admin privileges or memory corruption.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Josh Pitts of Okta, Inc.
- The core issue lies in how the Mach-O loader loads code versus how the code signing APIs are sometimes used by third-party applications and security tools.
- A proof of concept (POC) is provided using `ncat.frankenstein` which includes a valid Apple-signed Python binary and a malicious ad-hoc signed ncat binary.
- This vulnerability is specific to macOS and older versions of OSX.

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability is resolved in Little Snitch version 4.1 and later. Users should upgrade to this version.
- Developers should use `SecStaticCodeCheckValidityWithErrors()` or `SecStaticCodeCheckValidity()` with `kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures` flag to ensure all architectures in fat binaries are checked. Also, must perform root of trust checks, as described in the Okta blog post.
- Furthermore, a "anchor apple" requirement should be used when calling SecRequirementCreateWithString, requiring the Apple Software Signing chain of trust across all nested binaries in the Fat/Universal file.
