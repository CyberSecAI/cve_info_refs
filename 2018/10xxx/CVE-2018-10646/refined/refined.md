- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `CG6Service` service in CyberGhost for Windows exposes a `NetNamedPipe` endpoint that allows any installed application to call its methods. The `ConnectToVpnServer` method allows attacker control over the OpenVPN command line via the `connectionParams` argument.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure Named Pipe endpoint with publicly exposed methods
    - Lack of proper input validation on the `connectionParams` argument.
    - Ability to specify an arbitrary dynamic library plugin via OpenVPN command line options.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with `SYSTEM` privileges.

- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker can connect to the `NetNamedPipe` endpoint and use the `ConnectToVpnServer` method to inject malicious OpenVPN plugin configuration.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine where the vulnerable CyberGhost version is installed.
    - The attacker does not need any privileges.
