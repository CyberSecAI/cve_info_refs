Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input in the `order` parameter within the `pie-register/classes/invitation_code_pagination.php` file. Specifically, the plugin directly uses the `$_GET['order']` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `order` parameter allows for SQL injection attacks, specifically time-based blind SQL injection. The `esc_sql` function is used on the parameter, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   Through time-based blind SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials and other confidential information.
*   Depending on the database permissions, it might be possible to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the WordPress admin panel, specifically the `admin.php` page with the `page=pie-invitation-codes` parameter.
*   The malicious SQL code is injected through the `order` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site's admin panel.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially, as the vulnerability exists in a publicly accessible part of the plugin's code. However, exploitation may lead to gaining administrative or other privileged access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db content provides more details than the initial CVE description placeholder by giving the vulnerable file path and an example of a successful attack through time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The exploit-db content states the vulnerability affects Pie Register versions `<= 3.0.9`.
*   The provided wordpress.org content confirms that the plugin is "Registration Forms â€“ User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction" and is maintained by "Pie Register"
*   The wordpress.org content shows that the vulnerable plugin version is old, and the latest is 3.8.3.9, indicating that this vulnerability was fixed in later versions.
