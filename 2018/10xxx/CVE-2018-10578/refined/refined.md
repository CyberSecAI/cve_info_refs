- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The password change functionality in the web interface verifies the old password using AJAX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The old password verification is performed client-side via AJAX, allowing an attacker to bypass it by modifying the JavaScript or by crafting a manual POST request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the administrator password without knowing the current password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker interacts with the web interface of the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the web interface of the affected WatchGuard AP device. They also need to be able to manipulate web requests and responses, such as by intercepting the AJAX requests or crafting their own.
