Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `/uploads/results` page in the `redhat-certification` package does not properly restrict file access. Specifically, the `uploadResults` view does not properly check the `resultsPath`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application allows direct access to files based on a user-controlled path (`resultsPath`) without proper authorization checks.
- **File Deletion Vulnerability:**  A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to remove any file accessible by the user that runs the `httpd` service.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `resultsPath` parameter, allowing attackers to manipulate it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can remove any file on the system accessible to the `httpd` user. This could lead to denial of service, data loss, or other system malfunctions.
- **Potential Data Breach:** While this vulnerability is focused on deletion, depending on the files deleted, it could lead to a leak of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network through the `/uploads/results` page of the `redhat-certification` package.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, manipulating the `resultsPath` parameter to point to files that they want to delete.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable `redhat-certification` package.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information doesn't specify an authentication requirement to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the paths of files that they want to delete.

**Mitigation:**

- **SELinux:** Enabling SELinux can restrict the number of files accessible by the `httpd` process, mitigating the impact of this vulnerability. However, SELinux is not a complete fix and further fixes on the code base are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Riccardo Schirone from Red Hat Product Security.
- The bug was initially reported on 2018-06-21 and closed on 2021-10-25.
- The vulnerability is related to the `redhat-certification` package.
- The severity was medium.
-  The vulnerability allows a user to download existing files.
