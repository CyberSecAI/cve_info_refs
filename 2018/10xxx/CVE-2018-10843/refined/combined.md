| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1572786#c0)  Scott Dodson    2018-04-27 20:55:57 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1559143](show_bug.cgi?id=1559143 "CLOSED ERRATA - RFE - Need a way to upgrade OS during upgrade") +++  Description of problem:  Since the upgrade does an in-place upgrade, we would really like to be able to upgrade the base os (operating system, RHEL) while the node is drained and not running.  As it current stands, we need to drain a node 2x during an upgrade to get Openshift and then RHEL upgraded.  If we don't have an option, we'd like to have a hook that we can plug in to and run while openshift node is not running and the node is drained.  --- Additional comment from Scott Dodson on 2018-04-26 14:55:21 EDT ---  For master / 3.10  <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7743> <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/7736>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1572786#c1)  Scott Dodson    2018-04-27 20:57:31 UTC  ``` community provided backport pr <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/pull/8095>  Should be in openshift-ansible-3.9.27-1 and later   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1572786#c2)  Scott Dodson    2018-05-02 17:56:15 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1493921](show_bug.cgi?id=1493921 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - OpenShift upgrade: upgrade of atomic components and kernel on RHEL nodes") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1572786#c3)  Gaoyun Pei    2018-05-07 08:27:58 UTC  ``` Verify this bug with openshift-ansible-3.9.28-1.git.0.4fc2ce4.el7.noarch  With node pre-upgrade hook, we could do OS upgrade after node is unschedulable and drained, also with upgrade hook which would run after node is upgraded and before being schedulable again, we could also finished a server reboot.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.9.31 is now available with updates to packages and images that address security issues, fix several bugs, and add enhancements.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is the company's cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.31. See the following advisory for the container images for this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018:2014](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A2014)

Security Fix(es):

* routing: Malicious Service configuration can bring down routing for an entire shard (CVE-2018-1070)
* openshift-ansible: Incorrectly quoted values in etcd.conf causes disabling of SSL client certificate authentication (CVE-2018-1085)
* source-to-image: Builder images with assembler-user LABEL set to root allows attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10843)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank David Hocky (Comcast) for reporting CVE-2018-1085. The CVE-2018-1070 issue was discovered by Mark Chappell (Red Hat) and the CVE-2018-10843 issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat).

Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements in this advisory. See the following Release Notes documentation, which will be updated shortly for this release, for details about these changes:

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html>

All OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages and images.

## Solution

For OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 see the following documentation, which will be updated shortly for release 3.9.31, for important instructions on how to upgrade your cluster and fully apply this asynchronous errata update:

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/release_notes/ocp_3_9_release_notes.html>

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258.>

An attacker that can create images with the 'io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user' LABEL set to 'root' can execute arbitrary code with full privileges in the builder pod during S2I build.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2018-05-28 03:54:07 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jeremy Choi (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 18:01:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9  Via RHSA-2018:2013 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2013](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2013)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c12)  Scott Gayou    2018-11-14 16:18:02 UTC  ``` RHSCL release was packaged before io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user functionality was added to source-to-image.   ``` |  |

## Overview

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides developers and IT organizations with a cloud
application platform for deploying new applications on secure, scalable
resources with minimal configuration and management overhead. OpenShift Container Platform
supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java,
Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Kubernetes, OpenShift Container Platform provides a
secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for today’s enterprise-class
applications, while providing integrated application runtimes and libraries.
OpenShift Container Platform enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and
governance requirements.

## About This Release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 3.9
([RHBA-2018:0489](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A0489)) is now
available. This release is based on
[OpenShift
Origin 3.9](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v3.9.0). New features, changes, bug fixes, and known issues that pertain to
OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 are included in this topic.

To better synchronize versions of OpenShift Container Platform with Kubernetes, Red Hat did
not publicly release OpenShift Container Platform 3.8 and, instead, is releasing
OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 directly after version 3.7. See
[Installation](#ocp-39-installation) for information on how this impacts
installation and upgrade processes.

OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 is supported on RHEL 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 with the latest packages
from Extras, including Docker 1.13. It is also supported on Atomic Host 7.4.5
and newer. The **docker-latest** package is now deprecated.

TLSV1.2 is the only supported security version in OpenShift Container Platform version 3.4
and later. You must update if you are using TLSV1.0 or TLSV1.1.

For initial installations, see the
[Installing
a Cluster](../install_config/install/planning.html#install-config-install-planning) topics in the
[Installation and
Configuration](../install_config/index.html#install-config-index) documentation.

To upgrade to this release from a previous version, see the
[Upgrading Clusters](../upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index)
topic.

## New Features and Enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

### Container Orchestration

#### Soft Image Pruning

Now, when pruning images, you do not have to remove the actual image, just
update etcd storage.

It is safer to run `--keep-tag-revisions` and `--keep-younger-than`. After this
is run, administrators can choose to run hard prune (which is safe to run as
long as the registry is put in read-only mode).

#### Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 4.6 Container Management

The installation playbooks in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 have been updated to support
Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) 4.6, which is now currently
available. See the new
[Deploying Red Hat CloudForms on OpenShift Container Platform](../install_config/cfme/index.html#install-config-cfme-intro) topics for further information.

In addition, this release includes the following new features and updates:

* OpenShift Container Platform template provisioning
* Offline OpenScapScans
* Alert management: You can choose Prometheus (currently in Technology Preview) and use it in CloudForms.

#### CRI-O v1.9

CRI-O is a lightweight, native Kubernetes container runtime interface. By
design, it provides only the runtime capabilities needed by the kubelet. CRI-O is
designed to be part of Kubernetes and evolve in lock-step with the platform.

CRI-O brings:

* A minimal and secure architecture.
* Excellent scale and performance.
* The ability to run any Open Container Initiative (OCI) or docker image.
* Familiar operational tooling and commands.

![CRI-O](data:image/png;base64...)

To install and run CRI-O alongside `docker`, set the following in the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section
[Ansible inventory file](../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-ansible) during cluster installation:

```
openshift_use_crio=true
openshift_crio_use_rpm=true (1)
```

| **1** | CRI-O can only be installed as an RPM. The previously-available system container for CRI-O has been dropped from [Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) as of OpenShift Container Platform 3.9. |
| --- | --- |

|  | The `atomic-openshift-node` service must be RPM- or system container-based when using CRI-O; it cannot be `docker` container-based. The installer protects against using CRI-O with `docker` container nodes and will halt installation if detected. |
| --- | --- |

When CRI-O use is enabled, it is installed alongside `docker`, which currently
is required to perform build and push operations to the registry. Over time,
temporary `docker` builds can accumulate on nodes. You can optionally set the
following parameter to enable garbage collection. You must configure the node
selector so that the garbage collector runs only on nodes where `docker` is
configured for `overlay2` storage.

```
openshift_crio_enable_docker_gc=true
openshift_crio_docker_gc_node_selector={'runtime': 'cri-o'}
```

For example, the above would ensure it is only run on nodes with the `runtime:
cri-o` label. This can be helpful if you are running CRI-O only on
[some
nodes](../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.html#ansible-setting-global-build-defaults), and others are only running `docker`.

See the [upstream documentation](http://cri-o.io/) for more information on
CRI-O.

### Storage

#### PV Resize

You can expand persistent volume claims online from OpenShift Container Platform for CNS
glusterFS, Cinder, and GCE PD.

1. Create a storage class with `allowVolumeExpansion=true`.
2. The PVC uses the storage class and submits a claim.
3. The PVC specifies a new increased size.
4. The underlying PV is resized.

#### End-to-end Online Expansion and Resize for Containerized GlusterFS PV

You can expand persistent volume claims online from OpenShift Container Platform for CNS
glusterFS volumes.

This can be done online from OpenShift Container Platform. Previously, this was only
available from the Heketi CLI. You edit the PVC with the new size, triggering a
PV resize. This is fully qualified for glusterFs backed PVs. Gluster-block PV
resize was added with RHEL 7.5.

1. Add `allowVolumeExpansion=true` to the storage class.
2. Run:

   ```
   $ oc edit pvc claim-name
   ```
3. Edit the `spec.resources.requests.storage` field with the new value.

#### Container Native Storage GlusterFS PV Consumption Metrics Available from OpenShift Container Platform

Container Native Storage GlusterFS is extended to provide volume metrics
(including consumption) through Prometheus or Query.

Metrics are available from the PVC endpoint. This adds visibility to what is
being allocated and what is being consumed. Previously, you could only see
allocated size of the PVs. Now, you know how much is really consumed so, if
needed, you can expand it before it runs out of space. This also allows
administrators to do billing based on consumption, if needed.

Examples of added metrics include:

* `kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes`
* `kubelet_volume_stats_inodes`
* `kubelet_volume_stats_inodes_free`
* `kubelet_volume_stats_inodes_used`
* `kubelet_volume_stats_used_bytes`

#### Automated CNS Deployment with OpenShift Container Platform Advanced Installation

In the OpenShift Container Platform advanced installer, the CNS block provisioner deployment
is fixed and the CNS Un-install Playbook is added. This resolves the issue of CNS
block deployment with OpenShift Container Platform and also provides a way to uninstall a failed
installation of CNS.

CNS storage device details are added to the installer’s inventory file. The
advanced installer manages configuration and deployment of CNS, file and block
provisioners, registry, and ready-to-use PVs.

#### Tenant-driven Storage Snapshotting (Technology Preview)

Tenant-driven storage snapshotting is currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production
workloads.

Tenants now have the ability to leverage the underlying storage technology
backing the persistent volume (PV) assigned to them to make a snapshot of their
application data. Tenants can also now restore a given snapshot from the past to
their current application.

An external provisioner is used to access the EBS, GCE pDisk, and HostPath, and
Cinder snapshotting API. This Technology Preview feature has tested EBS and
HostPath. The tenant must stop the pods and start them manually.

1. The administrator runs an external provisioner for the cluster. These are images
   from the Red Hat Container Catalog.
2. The tenant made a PVC and owns a PV from one of the supported storage
   solutions.The administrator must create a new `StorageClass` in the cluster with:

   ```
   kind: StorageClass
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: snapshot-promoter
   provisioner: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/snapshot-promoter
   ```
3. The tenant can create a snapshot of a PVC named `gce-pvc` and the resulting
   snapshot will be called `snapshot-demo`.

   ```
   $ oc create -f snapshot.yaml

   apiVersion: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: VolumeSnapshot
   metadata:
     name: snapshot-demo
     namespace: myns
   spec:
     persistentVolumeClaimName: gce-pvc
   ```
4. Now, they can restore their pod to that snapshot.

   ```
   $ oc create -f restore.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: snapshot-pv-provisioning-demo
     annotations:
       snapshot.alpha.kubernetes.io/snapshot: snapshot-demo
   spec:
     storageClassName: snapshot-promoter
   ```

### Scale

#### Cluster Limits

Updated guidance around
[Cluster
Limits](../scaling_performance/cluster_limits.html#scaling-performance-cluster-limits) for OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 is now available.

#### Device Plug-ins (Technology Preview)

This is a feature currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production
workloads.

Device plug-ins allow you to use a particular device type (GPU, InfiniBand,
or other similar computing resources that require vendor-specific initialization
and setup) in your OpenShift Container Platform pod without needing to write custom code. The
device plug-in provides a consistent and portable solution to consume hardware
devices across clusters. The device plug-in provides support for these devices
through an extension mechanism, which makes these devices available to
containers, provides health checks of these devices, and securely shares them.

A device plug-in is a gRPC service running on the nodes (external to
`atomic-openshift-node.service`) that is responsible for managing specific
hardware resources.

See the [Developer
Guide](../dev_guide/device_plugins.html#using-device-plugins) for further conceptual information about Device Plug-ins.

#### CPU Manager (Technology Preview)

CPU Manager is a feature currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production
workloads.

CPU Manager manages groups of CPUs and constrains workloads to specific CPUs.

CPU Manager is useful for workloads that have some of these attributes:

* Require as much CPU time as possible.
* Are sensitive to processor cache misses.
* Are low-latency network applications.
* Coordinate with other processes and benefit from sharing a single processor
  cache.

See
[Using
CPU Manager](../scaling_performance/using_cpu_manager.html#scaling-performance-using-cpu-manager) for more information.

#### Device Manager (Technology Preview)

Device Manager is a feature currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production
workloads.

Some users want to set resource limits for hardware devices within their pod
definition and have the scheduler find the node in the cluster with those
resources. While at the same time, Kubernetes needed a way for hardware
vendors to advertise their resources to the kubelet without forcing them to
change core code within Kubernetes

The kubelet now houses a device manager that is extensible through plug-ins. You
load the driver support at the node level. Then, you or the vendor writes a
plug-in that listens for requests to stop/start/attach/assign the requested
hardware resources seen by the drivers. This plug-in is deployed to all the
nodes via a daemonSet.

See [Using Device
Manager](../dev_guide/device_manager.html#using-device-manager) for more information.

#### Huge Pages (Technology Preview)

Huge pages is a feature currently in [Technology
Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production workloads.

Memory is managed in blocks known as pages. On most systems, a page is 4Ki. 1Mi
of memory is equal to 256 pages; 1Gi of memory is 256,000 pages, and so on. CPUs
have a built-in memory management unit that manages a list of these pages in
hardware. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a small hardware cache of
virtual-to-physical page mappings. If the virtual address passed in a hardware
instruction can be found in the TLB, the mapping can be determined quickly. If
not, a TLB miss occurs, and the system falls back to slower, software-based
address translation, resulting in performance issues. Since the size of the
TLB is fixed, the only way to reduce the chance of a TLB miss is to increase the
page size.

A huge page is a memory page that is larger than 4Ki. On x86\_64 architectures,
there are two common huge page sizes: 2Mi and 1Gi. Sizes vary on other
architectures. In order to use huge pages, code must be written so that
applications are aware of them. Transparent Huge Pages (THP) attempt to automate
the management of huge pages without application knowledge, but they have
limitations. In particular, they are limited to 2Mi page sizes. THP can lead to
performance degradation on nodes with high memory utilization or fragmentation
due to defragmenting efforts of THP, which can lock memory pages. For this
reason, some applications may be designed to (or recommend) usage of
pre-allocated huge pages instead of THP.

In OpenShift Container Platform, applications in a pod can allocate and consume pre-allocated
huge pages.

See [Managing
Huge Pages](../scaling_performance/managing_hugepages.html#scaling-performance-managing-huge-pages) for more information.

### Networking

#### Semi-automatic Namespace-wide Egress IP

All outgoing external connections from a project share a single, fixed source IP
address and send all traffic via that IP, so that external firewalls can
recognize the application associated with a packet.

It is *semi-automatic* in that in the first half of implementing the automatic
namespace-wide egress IP feature, it implements the "traffic" side. Namespaces
with automatic egress IPs will send all traffic via that IP. However, it does
not implement the "management" side. Nothing automatically assigns egress IPs to
nodes yet. The administrator must do that manually.

See
[Managing
Networking](../admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-manage-networking) for more information.

#### Support Our Own HAProxy RPM for Consumption by the Router

Route configuration changes and process upgrades performed under heaving load
have typically required a stop and start sequence of certain services, causing
temporary outages.

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, HAProxy 1.8 sees no difference between updates and
upgrades; a new process is used with a new configuration, and the listening
socket’s file descriptor is transferred from the old to the new process so the
connection is never closed. The change is seamless, and enables our ability to
do things, like HTTP/2, in the future.

### Master

#### StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Deployments Now Supported

In OpenShift Container Platform, statefulsets, daemonsets, and deployments are now stable,
supported, and out of Technology Preview.

#### Central Audit Capability

Provides auditing of items that administrators would like to see, including:

* The event timestamp.
* The activity that generated the entry.
* The API endpoint that was called.
* The HTTP output.
* The item changed due to an activity, with details of the change.
* The user name of the user that initiated an activity.
* The name of the namespace the event occurred in, where possible.
* The status of the event, either success or failure.

Provides auditing of items that administrators would like to trace, including:

* User login and logout from (including session timeout) the web interface,
  including unauthorized access attempts.
* Account creation, modification, or removal.
* Account role or policy assignment or de-assignment.
* Scaling of pods.
* Creation of new project or application.
* Creation of routes and services.
* Triggers of builds and/or pipelines.
* Addition or removal or claim of persistent volumes.

Set up auditing in the ***master-config file***, and restart the **master-config**
service:

```
auditConfig:
  auditFilePath: "/var/log/audit-ocp.log"
  enabled: true
  maximumFileRetentionDays: 10
  maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 10
  maximumRetainedFiles: 10
  logFormat: json
  policyConfiguration: null
  policyFile: /etc/origin/master/audit-policy.yaml
  webHookKubeConfig: ""
  webHookMode:
```

Example log output:

```
{"kind":"Event","apiVersion":"audit.k8s.io/v1beta1","metadata":{"creationTimestamp":"2017-09-29T09:46:39Z"},"level":"Metadata","timestamp":"2017-09-29T09:46:39Z","auditID":"72e66a64-c3e5-4201-9a62-6512a220365e","stage":"ResponseComplete","requestURI":"/api/v1/securitycontextconstraints","verb":"create","user":{"username":"system:admin","groups":["system:cluster-admins","system:authenticated"]},"sourceIPs":["10.8.241.75"],"objectRef":{"resource":"securitycontextconstraints","name":"scc-lg","apiVersion":"/v1"},"responseStatus":{"metadata":{},"code":201}}
```

#### Add Support for Deployments to oc status

The `oc status` command provides an overview of the current project. This
provides similar output for upstream deployments as can be seen for downstream
DeploymentConfigs, with a nested deployment set:

```
$ oc status
In project My Project (myproject) on server https://127.0.0.1:8443

svc/ruby-deploy - 172.30.174.234:8080
  deployment/ruby-deploy deploys istag/ruby-deploy:latest <-
    bc/ruby-deploy source builds https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git on istag/ruby-22-centos7:latest
      build #1 failed 5 hours ago - bbb6701: Merge pull request #18 from durandom/master (Joe User <joeuser@users.noreply.github.com>)
    deployment #2 running for 4 hours - 0/1 pods (warning: 53 restarts)
    deployment #1 deployed 5 hours ago
```

Compare this to the output from OpenShift Container Platform 3.7:

```
$ oc status
In project dc-test on server https://127.0.0.1:8443

svc/ruby-deploy - 172.30.231.16:8080
  pod/ruby-deploy-5c7cc559cc-pvq9l runs test
```

#### Dynamic Admission Controller Follow-up (Technology Preview)

Dynamic Admission Controller Follow-up is a feature currently in
[Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and not for production
workloads.

An admission controller is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the
Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request
is authenticated and authorized. Example use cases include mutation of pod
resources and security response.

See
[Custom
Admission Controllers](../architecture/additional_concepts/dynamic_admission_controllers.html#architecture-additional-concepts-dynamic-admission-controllers) for more information.

#### Feature Gates

Platform administrators now have the ability to turn off specific features to the
entire platform. This assists in the control of access to alpha, beta, or
Technology Preview features in production clusters.

[Feature gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/feature-gates/) use a
key=value pair in the master and kubelet configuration files that describe the
feature you want to block.

Control Plane: master-config.yaml
```
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    feature-gates:
    - CPUManager=true
```

kubelet: node-config.yaml
```
kubeletArguments:
  feature-gates:
  - DevicePlugin=true
```

### Installation

#### Improved Playbook Performance

OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 introduces significant refactoring and restructuring of the
playbooks to improve performance. This includes:

* Restructured playbooks to push all fact-gathering and common dependencies up
  into the initialization plays so they are only called once rather than each time
  a role needs access to their computed values.
* Refactored playbooks to limit the hosts they touch to only those that are truly
  relevant to the playbook.

#### Quick Installation (Deprecated)

Quick Installation is now deprecated in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and will be
completely removed in a future release.

Quick installation will only be capable of installing 3.9. It will not be able
to upgrade from 3.7 or 3.8 to 3.9.

#### Automated 3.7 to 3.9 Control Plane Upgrade

The installer automatically handles stepping the control plane from 3.7 to 3.8
to 3.9 and node upgrade from 3.7 to 3.9.

Control plane components (API, controllers, and nodes on control plane hosts)
are upgraded seamlessly from 3.7 to 3.8 to 3.9. Data migration happens pre- and
post- OpenShift Container Platform 3.8 and 3.9 control plane upgrades. Other control plane
components (router, registry, service catalog, and brokers) are upgraded from
OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 to 3.9. Nodes (node, docker, ovs) are upgraded directly from
OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 to 3.9 with only one drain of nodes. OpenShift Container Platform 3.7
nodes operate indefinitely against 3.8 masters should the upgrade process need
to pause in this state. Logging and metrics are updated from OpenShift Container Platform 3.7
to 3.9.

It is recommended that you upgrade the control plane and nodes independently.
You can still perform the upgrade through an all-in-one playbook, but rollback
is more difficult. Playbooks do not allow for a clean installation of
OpenShift Container Platform 3.8.

See [Upgrading
Clusters](../upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index) for more information.

### Metrics and Logging

#### Journald for System Logs and JSON File for Container Logs

Docker log driver is set to `json-file` as the default for all nodes. Docker
`log-driver` can be set to `journal`, but there is no log rate throttling with
journal driver. So, there is always a risk for denial-of-service attacks from
rogue containers.

Fluentd will automatically determine which log driver (`journald` or
`json-file`) the container runtime is using. Fluentd will now always read logs
from journald and also ***/var/log/containers*** (if `log-driver` is set to
`json-file`). Fluentd will no longer read from ***/var/log/messages***.

See
[Aggregating
Container Logs](../install_config/aggregate_logging.html#install-config-aggregate-logging) for more information.

#### Prometheus (Technology Preview)

Prometheus remains in [Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview) and is
not for production workloads. Prometheus, AlertManager, and AlertBuffer versions
are now updated and node-exporter is now included:

* prometheus 2.1.0
* Alertmanager 0.14.0
* AlertBuffer 0.2
* node\_exporter 0.15.2

You can deploy Prometheus on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, collect Kubernetes and
infrastructure metrics, and get alerts. You can see and query metrics and alerts
on the Prometheus web dashboard. Alternatively, you can bring your own Grafana
and hook it up to Prometheus.

See [Prometheus
on OpenShift](../install_config/cluster_metrics.html#openshift-prometheus) for more information.

### Developer Experience

#### Jenkins Memory Usage Improvements

Previously, Jenkins worker pods would often consume too much or too little
memory. Now, a startup script intelligently looks at pod limits and environment
variables are appropriately set to ensure limits are respected for spawned JVMs.

#### CLI Plug-ins (Technology Preview)

CLI plug-ins are currently in [Technology Preview](#ocp-39-technology-preview)
and not for production workloads.

Usually called *plug-ins* or *binary extensions*, this feature allows you to
extend the default set of `oc` commands available and, therefore, allows you to
perform new tasks.

See [Extending the
CLI](../cli_reference/extend_cli.html#cli-reference-extend-cli) for information on how to install and write extensions for the CLI.

#### Ability to Specify Default Tolerations via the buildconfig Defaulter

Previously, there was not a way to set a default toleration on build pods so
they could be placed on build-specific nodes. The build defaulter is now updated
to allow the specification of a toleration value, which is applied to the build
pod upon creation.

See
[Configuring
Global Build Defaults and Overrides](../install_config/build_defaults_overrides.html#install-config-build-defaults-overrides) for more information.

#### Default Hard Eviction Thresholds

OpenShift Container Platform uses the following default configuration for `eviction-hard`.

```
...
kubeletArguments:
  eviction-hard:
  - memory.available<100Mi
  - nodefs.available<10%
  - nodefs.inodesFree<5%
  - imagefs.available<15%
...
```

See
[Handling
Out of Resource Errors](../admin_guide/out_of_resource_handling.html#admin-guide-handling-out-of-resource-errors) for more information.

### Web Console

#### Catalog from within Project View

Quickly get to the catalog from within a project by clicking **Catalog** in the
left navigation.

![Catalog tab](data:image/png;base64...)

#### Quickly Search the Catalog from within Project View

To quickly find services from within project view, type in your search criteria.

![Search the catalog](data:image/png;base64...)

#### Select Preferred Home Page

You can now jump straight to certain pages after login. Access the menu from
the account dropdown, choose your option, then log out, then log back in.

![Set preferred home page](data:image/gif;base64...)

#### Configurable Inactivity Timeout

You can now configure the web console to log users out after a set timeout. The
default is `0` (never).
[Set
the Ansible variable](../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-web-console-customization) to the number of minutes:

```
openshift_web_console_inactivity_timeout_minutes=n
```

#### Web Console as a Separate Pod

The web console is now separated out of the API server. The web console is
packaged as a container image and deployed as a pod. Configure via the
ConfigMap. Changes are auto-detected.

Masters are now schedulable and required to be schedulable for the web consoles
deployments to work.

## Notable Technical Changes

OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 introduces the following notable technical changes.

### Manual Upgrade Process Now Unsupported

As of OpenShift Container Platform 3.9,
[manual
upgrades](../upgrading/manual_upgrades.html#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades) are not supported. In a future release, this process will be removed.

### Masters Marked as Schedulable Nodes by Default

In previous versions of OpenShift Container Platform, master hosts were marked as
unschedulable nodes by default by the installer, meaning that new pods could not
be placed on the hosts. Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, however, masters are
marked schedulable automatically during installation and upgrade. This change is
mainly so that the web console, which used to run as part of the master itself,
can instead be run as a pod deployed to the master.

### Default Node Selector Set By Default and Automatic Node Labeling

Starting in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, masters are now marked as schedulable nodes by
default. As a result, the default node selector (defined in the master
configuration file’s `projectConfig.defaultNodeSelector` field to determine
which node that projects will use by default when placing pods, and previously
left blank by default) is now set by default during cluster installations and
upgrades. It is set to `node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true` unless overridden
using the `osm_default_node_selector` Ansible variable.

In addition, whether `osm_default_node_selector` is set or not, the following
automatic labeling occurs for hosts defined in your inventory file during
installations and upgrades:

* non-master, non-dedicated infrastructure nodes hosts (by default, this means
  nodes with a `region=infra` label) are labeled with
  `node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true`, which assigns the `compute` node role.
* master nodes are labeled with `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true`, which
  assigns the `master` node role.

This ensures that the default node selector has available nodes to choose from
when determining pod placement. See
[Configuring Node Host Labels](../install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-node-host-labels) for more details.

### Ansible Must Be Installed via the rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms Channel

Starting in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, Ansible must be installed via the
`rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms` channel, which is included in RHEL
subscriptions.

### Several oc secrets Subcommands Now Deprecated

OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 deprecates the following `oc secrets` subcommands in favor
of `oc create secret`:

* `new`
* `new-basicauth`
* `new-dockercfg`
* `new-sshauth`
### Updated Default Values for template\_service\_broker\_prefix and template\_service\_broker\_image\_name in the Installer

Default values for `template_service_broker_prefix` and
`template_service_broker_image_name` in installer have been updated to be
consistent with other settings.

Previous values are:

* `template_service_broker_prefix="registry.example.com/openshift3/"`
* `template_service_broker_image_name="ose-template-service-broker"`

New values are:

* `template_service_broker_prefix="registry.example.com/openshift3/ose-"`
* `template_service_broker_image_name="template-service-broker"`
### Removed Several Instances of 'become: no' on Certain Tasks and Playbooks Inside of openshift-anisble

In an effort to provide greater flexibility for users, several instances of
`become: no` on certain tasks and playbooks inside of `openshift-anisble` are
now removed. These statements were primarily applied on `local_action` and
`delegate_to: localhost` commands for creating temporary files on the host
running Ansible.

If a user is running Ansible from a host that does not allow password-less
`sudo`, some of these commands may fail if you run the `ansible-playbook` with
the `-b` (`become`) command line switch, or if it has `ansible_become=True`
applied to the local host in the inventory or `group_vars`.

Elevated permissions are not required on the local host when running
`openshift-ansible` plays.

If target hosts (where OpenShift Container Platform is being deployed) require the use of
`become`, it is recommended that you add `ansible_become=True` for those hosts
or groups in inventory or `group_vars`/`host_vars`.

If the user is running as root on the local host or connection to the root user
on the remote hosts instead of using become, then you should not notice a change.

### Unqualified Image Specifications

Unqualified image specifications now default to `docker.io` and require API
server configuration to resolve to different registries.

### batch/v2alpha1 ScheduledJob Objects Are No Longer Supported

The `batch/v2alpha1 ScheduledJob` objects are no longer supported. Use CronJobs
instead.

### The autoscaling/v2alpha1 API Group Is Removed

The `autoscaling/v2alpha1` API group has been removed

### Start Node Requires Swap to be Disabled

For new installations of OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 , disabling swap is a strong
recommendation. For OpenShift Container Platform 3.8, the OpenShift Container Platform start node requires
swap to be disabled. This is already done as part of the Ansible node
installation.

### oadm Command Is Deprecated

The `oadm` command is now deprecated. Use `oc adm` instead.

### StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Deployments Now Fully Supported

The core workloads API, which is composed of the `DaemonSet`, `Deployment`,
`ReplicaSet`, and `StatefulSet kinds`, has been promoted to GA stability in the
`apps/v1` group version. As such, the `apps/v1beta2` group version is
deprecated, and all new code should use the kinds in the apps/v1 group version.
For OpenShift Container Platform this means the statefulsets, daemonsets, and deployments are
now stable and supported.

### Administrator Solutions Guide Removed

In OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, the Administrator Solutions guide is removed from the
OpenShift Container Platform documentation. See the
[Day Two Operations Guide](../day_two_guide/index.html#day-two-guide-index)
instead.

## Bug Fixes

This release fixes bugs for the following components:

**Builds**

* Previously, builds selected the secret to be used for pushing the output image
  at the time they were started. When a build started before the default service
  account secrets for a project were created, the build may not have found a
  suitable secret for pushing the image, resulting in the build failing when it
  went to push the image. With this fix, the build is held until the default
  service account secrets exist, ensuring that if the default secret is suitable
  for pushing the image, it can and will be used. As a result, initial builds in a
  newly created project are no longer at risk of failing if the build is created
  before the default secrets are populated.
  ([**BZ#1333030**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1333030))

**Command Line Interface**

* The `systemd` units for masters changed without the diagnostics being updated.
  This caused the diagnostics to silently check for master `systemd` units that
  did not exist, and problems were not reported. With this fix, diagnostics check
  for correct master unit names and problems with master `systemd` units and logs
  may be found.
  ([**BZ#1378883**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1378883))

**Containers**

* If a container shares namespace with another container, then they would share
  the namespace path. If you run the `exec` command in the first container, it
  only reads the namespace paths stored in the file and joins those namespaces.
  So, if the second container has already been stopped, the `exec` command in the
  first container will fail. As a result, this fix saves namespace paths no matter
  if containers share namespaces.
  ([**BZ#1510573**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510573))

**Images**

* Docker has a known "zombie process" phenomenon that impacted the OpenShift
  Jenkins image, causing operating system-level resources to be exhausted as these
  “zombie processes” accumulated. With this fix, the OpenShift Jenkins image now
  leverages one of the Docker image `init` implementations to launch Jenkins,
  monitor, and handle any “zombie child processes”. As a result, “zombie
  processes” no longer accumulate.
  ([**BZ#1528548**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1528548))
* Due to a fault in the scheduler implementation, the
  `ScheduledImageImportMinimumIntervalSeconds` setting was not correctly observed,
  causing OpenShift Container Platform to attempt to import scheduled images at the wrong
  intervals. This is now resolved.
  ([**BZ#1543446**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543446))
* Previously, OpenShift would erroneously re-import all tags on an image stream,
  regardless if marked as scheduled or not, if any tag on the image stream was
  marked as scheduled. This behavior is now resolved.
  ([**BZ#1515060**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515060))

**Image Registry**

* The signature importer tried to import signatures from the internal registry
  without credentials, causing the registry to check if the anonymous user could
  get signatures using SAR requests. With this bug fix, the signature importer skips
  the internal registry because the internal registry and the signature importer
  work with the same storage, resulting in no SAR requests.
  ([**BZ#1543122**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543122))
* There was no check of the number of components in the path, causing the data to
  be placed in the storage but not be written to the database. With this bug fix, an
  early check of the path was added.
  ([**BZ#1528613**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1528613))

**Installer**

* The Kubernetes service IP address was not added to `no_proxy` list for the
  docker-registry during installation. As a result, internal registry requests
  would be forced to use the proxy, preventing logins and pushes to the internal
  registry. The installer was changed to add the Kubernetes service IP to the
  `no_proxy` list.
  ([**BZ#1504464**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504464))
* The installer was pulling the incorrect efs-provisioner image, which caused the
  installation of the provisioner pod to fail to deploy. The installer was changed
  to pull the correct image.
  ([**BZ#1523534**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523534))
* When installing OpenShift Container Platform with a custom registry, the installer was using
  the default registry. The registry console default image is now defined as a
  fully qualified image `registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/registry-console`
  which means that when a custom registry is specified via `oreg_url` and image
  streams are modified to use that custom registry the registry console will also
  utilize the custom registry.
  ([**BZ#1523638**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523638))
* Running the ***redeploy-etcd-ca.yml*** playbook did not update the `ca.crt` used
  by etcd system container. The code was changed so that the playbook properly
  updates the etcd ca.crt in ***/etc/etcd/ca.crt*** as expected.
  ([**BZ#1466216**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466216))
* Following a successful deployment of CNS/CRS with glusterblock, OpenShift Container Platform
  logging and metrics can be deployed using glusterblock as their backend storage
  for fault-tolerant, distributed persistent storage.
  ([**BZ#1480835**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1480835))
* When upgrading from 3.6 to 3.7, the user wanted the Hawkular OpenShift Agent
  pods deactivated. But, after upgrade, the HOSA pods are still being deployed. A
  new playbook, **uninstall\_hosa.yaml**, has been created to remove HOSA from a
  OpenShift Container Platform cluster when `openshift_metrics_install_hawkular_agent=false` in
  the Ansible inventory file.
  ([**BZ#1497408**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497408))
* Because registry credentials for the broker were stored in a ConfigMap,
  sensitive credentials could be exposed in plain text. A secret is now created to
  store the credentials Registry credentials are no longer visible in plaintext.
  ([**BZ#1509082**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509082))
* Because of incorrect naming, the uninstall playbook did not remove the
  **tuned-profiles-atomic-openshift-node** package. The playbook is now corrected
  and the package is removed upon uninstallation of OpenShift Container Platform.
  ([**BZ#1509129**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509129))
* When running the installer with the
  `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_volume_size` parameter configured with Jnja
  code, the installation failed during persistent volume creation. The code is now
  fixed to properly interpret the Jinja code.
  ([**BZ#1518386**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518386))
* During disconnected installations, the service catalog was attempting to pull
  down images from the configured registry. This caused the installation to fail
  as the registry is not available during a disconnected installation. The
  `imagePullPolicy` in the installer was changed to `ifNotPresent`. If the image
  is present, the service catalog will not attempt to pull it again, and the
  disconnected installation of the service catalog will proceed.
  ([**BZ#1524805**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1524805))
* When provisioning hosts with an SSH proxy configured, the masters would never
  appear marked as up. With this bug fix, the task is changed to use an Ansible
  module that respects SSH proxy configuration. As a result, Ansible is able to
  connect to the hosts and they are marked as up.
  ([**BZ#1541946**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1541946))
* In an HTTPS environment, the service catalog installation was failing because
  the playbook attempted to contact the API server using cURL without the
  `--noproxy` option specified. The command in the playbook was changed to include
  `--noproxy` and the installer performs as expected.
  ([**BZ#1544645**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544645))
* Previously, the storage type for Elasticsearch data centers was not preserved
  when upgrading/rerunning. This caused the existing storage type to be
  overwritten. This bug fix preserves the storage type as the default (using an
  inventory variable if specified).
  ([**BZ#1496758**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1496758))
* Previously, the docker daemon was incorrectly restarted when redeploying node
  certificates. This caused unnecessary downtime in nodes since
  `atomic-openshift-node` was the only component loading the kubeconfig. This bug
  fix adds a flag to check if a new Certificate Authority (CA) is being deployed.
  If not, then restarting Docker is skipped.
  ([**BZ#1537726**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537726))
* Previously, the `docker_image_availability` check did not take into account
  variables that override specific container images used for containerized
  components. This caused the check to incorrectly report failures when looking
  for the default images when the overridden images were actually available. As a
  result of this bug fix, the check should accurately report whether the necessary
  images are available.
  ([**BZ#1538806**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538806))
* When determining if a persistent volume claim (PVC) should be created for
  Elasticsearch, we used a legacy variable, which did not correctly evaluate if a
  PVC was necessary when creating a Network File System (NFS)-backed persistent
  volume (PV). This bug fix correctly evaluates if a PVC is necessary for the
  deployment configuration.
  ([**BZ#1538995**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1538995))
* Previously, when configuring the registry for Azure Blob storage, the realm of
  `core.windows.net` was specified by default. This bug fix allows you to change
  `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_azure_blob_realm` to the value that you want
  to use. ([**BZ#1491100**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491100))
* A new playbook has been introduced that uninstalls an existing GlusterFS
  deployment. This playbook removes all existing resources, including pods and
  services. This playbook also, optionally, removes all data and configuration
  from the hosts that were running GlusterFS pods.
  ([**BZ#1497038**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1497038))

**Logging**

* Previously, the OpenShift Container Platform logging system did not support CRI-O. This bug
  fix added a parser for CRI-O formatted logs. As a result, both system and
  container logs can be collected.
  ([**BZ#1517605**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1517605))
* When redeploying logging, we previously attempted to maintain any changes that
  were made to the ConfigMaps post-installation. It was difficult to let users
  specify the contents of a ConfigMap file while still needing the ability to
  provide the configurations required for the different Elasticsearch, Fluentd,
  and Kibana (EFK) stack components. This bug fix created a patch based on changes
  made post-deployment and applies that patch to the files provided by the
  installer.
  ([**BZ#1519619**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519619))

**Web Console**

* The Kibana page previously displayed **OPENSHIFT ORIGIN** in the upper left-hand
  corner of the OpenShift Container Platform web console. This bug fix replaces the Origin
  header image with the OpenShift Container Platform header image. As a result, the Kibana page
  now displays the desired header.
  ([**BZ#1546311**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546311))
* Both the OpenShift Container Platform `DeploymentConfig` and Kubernetes extensions/v1beta1
  Deployment resources were labeled with deployment on the web console overview,
  so you could not differentiate the resources. `DeploymentConfig` resources on
  the **Overview** page are now labelled with `DeploymentConfig`.
  ([**BZ#1488380**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1488380))
* The web console’s pod status filter did not correctly display pod init status
  when an error prevented the pod from initializing, including and init status of
  error. If a pod has an `Init:Error` status, the pod status correctly displays
  **Init Error** instead of **Pod Initializing**.
  ([**BZ#1512473**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1512473))
* Previously, switching tabs in the web console page for a pipeline build
  configuration caused some content on the page to no longer be visible while the
  page reloaded. Switching tabs no longer reloads the entire page, and content is
  correctly displayed.
  ([**BZ#1527346**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1527346))
* By default, an old version of the builder image was shown when you added a
  builder to a project and selected by default during builder configuration. This
  gave the wrong impression that your only choice was an old version of a language
  or framework. The version number is no longer shown in the wizard title, and the
  newest available version is selected by default.
  ([**BZ#1542669**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1542669))
* If you used some browsers, you could not consistently use the right click menu
  to copy and paste text from internal editors that used the ACE editor library,
  including the YAML, Jenkinsfile, and Dockerfile editors. This update uses a
  newer version of the ACE editor library, so the right click menu options work
  throughout the console.
  ([**BZ#1463617**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463617))
* Previously, browsers would use the default behavior for the Referrer-Policy
  because Referrer-Policy header was not sent by the console. Now the console
  correctly sends the Referrer-Policy header, which is set to
  `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, and browsers that listen to the
  Referrer-Policy header follow the `strict-origin-when-cross-origin policy` for
  the web console.
  ([**BZ#1504571**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504571))
* Previously, users with read access to the project saw webhook secret values
  because they were stored as strings in the build. These users could use these
  values to trigger builds even though they had only read access to the project.
  Now webhook secrets are defined as secret objects in the build instead of
  strings. Users with read only access to the project cannot see the secret values
  or use them to trigger builds by using the webhook.
  ([**BZ#1504819**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1504819))
* Previously, adding the same persistent volume claim more than once to a
  deployment in the web console caused pods for that deployment to fail. The web
  console incorrectly created a new volume when it added the second PVC to the
  deployment instead of reusing the existing volume from the pod template spec.
  Now, the web console reuses the existing volume if the same PVC is listed more
  than once. This behavior lets you add the same PVC with different mount paths
  and subpaths as needed.
  ([**BZ#1527689**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1527689))
* Previously, it was not clear enough that you can not select an **Image Name** from
  the Deploy Image window if you are also creating a new project. The help text
  that explains that you can only set an **Image Name** for existing projects is
  easier to find.
  ([**BZ#1535917**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535917))
* Previously, the secrets page in the web console did not display labels. You can
  now view the labels for a secret like other resources.
  ([**BZ#1545828**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1545828))
* Sometimes the web console displayed a process template page even if you did not
  have permissions to process templates. If you tried to process the template, an
  error displayed. Now you can no longer view process templates if you cannot
  process them.
  ([**BZ#1510786**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510786))
* Previously, the **Clear Changes** button did not correctly clear edits to the
  **Environment From** variables in the web console environment variable editor. The
  button now correctly resets edits to **Environment From** variables.
  ([**BZ#1515527**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515527))
* By default, dialogs in the web console can be dismissed by clicking in the
  negative space surrounding the dialog. IAs a result, the warning dialog could be
  inadvertently dismissed. With this bug fix, the warning dialog’s configuration
  was changed so that it can only be dismissed by clicking one of the buttons in
  the dialog. The warning dialog can no longer be inadvertently dismissed by the
  user, as clicking one of the dialog’s buttons is now required in order to close
  the dialog.
  ([**BZ#1525819**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525819))

**Master**

* Due to a fault in the scheduler implementation, the
  `ScheduledImageImportMinimumIntervalSeconds` setting was not correctly observed,
  causing OpenShift Container Platform to attempt to import scheduled images at the wrong
  intervals. With this bug fix, the issue is now resolved.
  ([**BZ#1515058**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1515058))

**Networking**

* The OpenShift Container Platform node was not waiting long enough for the VNID while the
  master assigns the VNID and it could take a while to propagate to the node. As a
  result, pod creation fails. Increase the timeout from 1 to 5 seconds for
  fetching VNID on the node. This bug fix allows pod creation to succeed.
  ([**BZ#1509799**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1509799))
* It is now possible to specify a subnet length as part of the `EGRESS_SOURCE`
  variable passed to an egress router (for example, `192.168.1.100/24` rather than
  `192.168.1.100`). In some network configurations (such as if the gateway address
  was a virtual IP that might be backed by one of several physical IPs at
  different times), ARP traffic between the egress router and its gateway might
  not function correctly if the egress router is not able to send traffic to other
  hosts on its local subnet. By specifying `EGRESS_SOURCE` with a subnet length,
  the egress router setup script will configure the egress pod in a way that will
  work with these network setups.
  ([**BZ#1527602**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1527602))
* In some circumstances, iptables rules could become reordered in a way that would
  cause the **per-project static IP address** feature to stop working for some IP
  addresses. (For most users, egress IP addresses that ended with an even number
  would continue to work, but egress IP addresses ending with an odd number would
  fail.) Therefore, external traffic from pods in a project that was supposed to
  use a per-project static IP address would end up using the normal node IP
  address instead. The iptables rules are changed so that they now have the
  expected effect even when they get reordered. With this bug fix, the per-project
  static egress IP feature now works reliably.
  ([**BZ#1527642**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1527642))
* Previously, the egress IP initialization code was only run when doing a full SDN
  setup, and not when OpenShift services were restarted and found any existing
  running SDN. This resulted in failure to create new per-project static egress
  IPs (`HostSubnet.EgressIPs`). This issue is now fixed and per-project static
  egress IPs works correctly after a node restart.
  ([**BZ#1533153**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1533153))
* Previously, OpenShift was setting colliding host-subnet values, which resulted
  in pod IP network to became unavailable across the nodes. This was because the
  stale OVS rules were not cleared during node startup. This is now fixed and
  the stale OVS rules are cleared on node startup.
  ([**BZ#1539187**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1539187))
* With previous version, if an static IP addressed was removed from a project and
  then added back to the same project, it did not worked correctly. This is now
  fixed, removing and re-adding static egress IPs works.
  ([**BZ#1547899**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547899))
* Previously, when OpenShift was deployed on OpenStack, there were few required
  `iptables` rules that were not created automatically, which resulted in errors
  in pop-to-pod communication between pods on different nodes. The Ansible
  OpenShift installer now sets the required `iptables` rules automatically.
  ([**BZ#1493955**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1493955))
* There was a race condition in the startup code that relied on the node setup,
  setting a field that the userspace proxy needed. When the network plugin was not
  used (or if it was fast) the userspace proxy setup ran sooner and resulted in
  reading a nil value for the IP address of the node. Later when the proxy (or the
  `unidler` which uses it) was enabled, it would crash because of the nil IP
  address value. This issue is now fixed. A retry loop is added that waits for the
  IP address value to be set and the userspace proxy and `unidler` work as expected.
  ([**BZ#1519991**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519991))
* In some circumstances, nodes were receiving a duplicate out-of-order HostSubnet
  `deleted` event from the master. During processing of this duplicate event, the
  node ended up deleting OVS flows corresponding to an active node, disrupting
  communications between these two nodes. In the latest version. the HostSubnet
  event-processing now checks for and ignores duplicate events. Thus, the OVS
  flows are not deleted, and pods communicate normally.
  ([**BZ#1544903**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544903))
* Previously, the `openshift ex dockergc` command to cleanup docker images, failed
  occasionally. This issue is now fixed.
  ([**BZ#1511852**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511852))
* Previously, nested secrets did not get mounted in pod. This issue is now fixed.
  ([**BZ#1516569**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1516569))
* HAproxy versions earlier than version 1.9 dropped new connections during a
  reload. This issue is now fixed. By using HAproxy’s seamless reload feature,
  HAproxy now passes open sockets when reloading, fixing reload issues. fixed.
  ([**BZ#1464657**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1464657))
* There was a spurious error in system logs. The error `Stat fs failed. Error: no
  such file or directory` appeared in logs frequently. This was because of calling
  the `syscall.Statfs` function in code when the path does not exist. This issue
  is now fixed.
  ([**BZ#1511576**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1511576))
* Previously, a reject routes error message showed up when using router shards.
  This issue is now fixed and the rejected routes error messages are now
  suppressed in HAproxy if router shards are used.
  ([**BZ#1491717**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1491717))
* Previously, if creating a route with the host set to `localhost`, and if the
  `ROUTER_USE_PROXY_PROTOCOL` environment variable was not set to `true`, any
  route reloads would fail. This is because the hostname being set to the default
  resulted in mismatches in route configurations. The `-H` option is now available
  when using `curl`, meaning the health check does not pass the hostname when set
  to 'localhost', and routes reload successfully.
  ([**BZ#1542612**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1542612))
* Previously, updating TLS certificates was not possible for cluster
  administrators. Because it is an expected task of the cluster administrator, the
  role has been changed to update TLS certificates.
  ([**BZ#1524707**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1524707))

**Service Broker**

* Previously, the APBs for MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL were tagged as
  "databases" instead of "database". This is corrected with the tag "database"
  matching other services which is now properly shown in search results.
  ([**BZ#1510804**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510804))
* Async bind and unbind is an experimental feature for the OpenShift Ansible
  broker (OAB) and is not supported or enabled by default. Red Hat’s officially
  released APBs (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL, and Mediawiki) also do not support
  async bind and unbind. ([**BZ#1548997**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1548997))
* Previously, the etcd server was not accessible when using the `etcdctl` command.
  This was caused by the tcp being set to “0.0.0.0” instead of the expected
  `--advertise-client-urls` value of the `asb-etcd` deployment configuration. The
  command had been updated and the etcd server is now accessible.
  ([**BZ#1514417**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514417))
* Previously, the `apb push -o` command failed when using it outside the cluster.
  This was because the Docker registry service of the desired service was set to
  hit only the route used by internal operations. The appropriate Ansible playbook
  has been updated to point to the appropriate route instead.
  ([**BZ#1519193**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519193))
* Previously, when typing `asbd --help` or `asbd -h`, the `--help` argument returned
  a code that was being misinterpreted as an error, resulting in errors printing
  out twice. The fix corrects errors to only print once and also to interpret the
  help command return code as valid. As a result, the help command now only prints
  once. ([**BZ#1525817**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1525817))
* Previously, setting the `white-list` variable in an RHCC registry would maintain
  searching for any options, even after those options are removed from the
  configuration. This was caused by an error in the `white-list` code. The error
  has been fixed by this bug.
  ([**BZ#1526887**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1526887))
* Previously, if the registry configuration did not have `auth_type` set to
  `config` error messages would appear. This bug ensures that registry
  configurations work correctly without the `auth_type` setting.
  ([**BZ#1526949**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1526949))
* Previously, the broker would return a 400 status code when the user did not have
  the permissions to execute a task instead of the 403 status code. This bug fixes
  the error, and the correct status code is now returned.
  ([**BZ#1510486**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510486))
* Previously, any MariaDB configuration options were displayed with MySQL options.
  This is because MariaDB uses MySQL variables upstream. This bug fix ensures
  that, in terms of OpenShift, the variables are called out as MariaDB.
  ([**BZ#1510294**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1510294))

**Storage**

* Previously, OpenShift checked mounted NFS volume with root squash. OpenShift
  permissions while running as root were squashed to the 'nobody' user, who did
  not have permissions to access mounted NFS volume. This caused any OpenShift
  checks to fail, and it did not unmount NFS volumes. Now, OpenShift does not
  access mounted NFS volumes, and checks for mounts by parsing /proc filesystem.
  NFS volumes with root squash option are unmounted.
  ([**BZ#1518237**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1518237))
* Previously, when a node that had an OpenStack Cinder type of persistent volume
  attached was shut down or crashed, the attached volume did not
  detach.Consequence: Because the persistent volume was unavailable, the pods did
  not migrate from the failed node, and the volumes were inaccessible from other
  nodes and pods. Now a node fails, all of its attached volumes are detached after
  a time-out.
  ([**BZ#1523142**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523142))
* Previously, downward API, secrets, ConfigMap, and projected volumes fully
  managed their content and did not allow any other volumes to be mounted on top
  of them. This meant that users could not mount any volume on top of the
  aforementioned volumes. With this bug fix, the volumes now touch only the files
  they create. As a result, users can mount any volume on top of the
  aforementioned volumes.
  ([**BZ#1430322**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1430322))

**Upgrade**

* The upgrade playbooks did not previously regenerate the registry certificate
  when upgrading from releases prior to 3.6, which lacked the name
  'docker-registry.default.svc'. As such, the configuration variables were not
  updated to push to the registry via DNS. The 3.9 upgrade playbooks now
  regenerate the certificate when needed, ensuring that all environments upgraded
  to 3.9 now push to the registry via DNS.
  ([**BZ#1519060**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519060))
* The etcd host validation now accepts one or more etcd hosts, allowing greater
  flexibility in the number of etcd hosts configured. The recommended number of
  etcd hosts is still 3.

## Known Issues

* There is a known issue in the initial GA release of OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 that
  causes the installation and upgrade playbooks to consume more memory than
  previous releases. The node scale-up and installation Ansible playbooks may have
  consumed more memory on the control host (the system where you run the playbooks
  from) than expected due to the use of `include_tasks` in several places. This
  issue has been addressed with the release of
  [RHBA-2018:0600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A0600); the
  majority of these instances have now been converted to `import_tasks` calls,
  which do not consume as much memory. After this change, memory consumption on
  the control host should be below 100MiB per host; for large environments (100+
  hosts), a control host with at least 16GiB of memory is recommended.
  [(**BZ#1558672**)](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558672)

## Asynchronous Errata Updates

Security, bug fix, and enhancement updates for OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 are released
as asynchronous errata through the Red Hat Network. All OpenShift Container Platform 3.9
errata is [available on the Red
Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/). See the
[OpenShift Container Platform
Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift) for more information about asynchronous errata.

Red Hat Customer Portal users can enable errata notifications in the account
settings for Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM). When errata notifications
are enabled, users are notified via email whenever new errata relevant to their
registered systems are released.

|  | Red Hat Customer Portal user accounts must have systems registered and consuming OpenShift Container Platform entitlements for OpenShift Container Platform errata notification emails to generate. |
| --- | --- |

This section will continue to be updated over time to provide notes on
enhancements and bug fixes for future asynchronous errata releases of
OpenShift Container Platform 3.9. Versioned asynchronous releases, for example with the form
OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.z, will be detailed in subsections. In addition, releases in
which the errata text cannot fit in the space provided by the advisory will be
detailed in subsections that follow.

|  | For any OpenShift Container Platform release, always review the instructions on [upgrading your cluster](../upgrading/index.html#install-config-upgrading-index) properly. |

### RHBA-2018:1566 - OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.27 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-05-16

OpenShift Container Platform release 3.9.27 is now available. The packages and bug fixes
included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2018:1566](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1566) advisory.
The container images included in the update are provided by the
[RHBA-2018:1567](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1567) advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and images for this release in
the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and images included in this release.

#### Upgrading

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 or 3.9 cluster to this latest
release, use the automated upgrade playbook. See
[Performing
Automated In-place Cluster Upgrades](../upgrading/automated_upgrades.html#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly) for instructions.

#### Bug Fixes

* Build pods use multiple containers. Binary builds need to specify which
  container to stream content into, and for custom builds the name of the
  container is different from non-custom builds. When streaming binary content
  into a custom build, the expected container, git-clone, does not exist and the
  build fails. The logic for streaming binary content into a custom build pod will
  be changed to reference the correct container name, custom-build. With this bug
  fix, binary content will successfully stream into the custom build container.
  ([**BZ#1560659**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560659))
* Resource constraints can lead to the readiness probe in the example Jenkins
  templates readiness probes citing failure prematurely. Jenkins deployments would
  fail unnecessarily. With this bug fix, the readiness probe was relaxed in the
  templates. As a result, there is a decrease in unnecessary Jenkins deployment
  failures due to the aggressive readiness probe.
  ([**BZ#1559675**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1559675))
* The master ***admin.kubeconfig*** file was added to the `oc command` to allow the
  operation to have the proper authorization and access to the necessary
  resources.
  ([**BZ#1561247**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1561247))
* The installer improperly tried to set the SELinux context on a path that may not
  exist. This task was meant to work around a problem in CRI-O that no longer
  exists and, as such, that task has been removed.
  ([**BZ#1564949**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564949))
* Service catalog pods had a high log verbosity set by default. Therefore, service
  catalog pods on the master node produced a large amount of log data. The default
  log verbosity is now reset to a lower level.
  ([**BZ#1564179**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564179))
* The Elasticsearch server TLS certificate does not have an external host name in
  the subject alt. name list. Clients accessing Elasticsearch externally cannot
  turn on the MITM server certificate validation. When configuring Elasticsearch
  to allow external access, add the external host name in the subject alt. name
  list. TLS clients can turn on server certificate validation.
  ([**BZ#1554878**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554878))
* The Fluentd plug-in logs the entire error response on failure, which fills up
  the on-disk logs. The entire response is now only logged when in debug mode and
  on-disk logs no logger consume the disk.
  ([**BZ#1554885**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554885))
* The default write operation for Fluentd to Elasticsearch is `index`. Writes can
  trigger unnecessary `delete` operations for Elasticsearch, causing extra load
  that affects performance. Use the `create` operation. Writes to elasticsearch
  will only create records or skip updates if the records are duplicates reducing
  the load on the server.
  ([**BZ#1565909**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1565909))
* The curator pod was crash-looping because it was unable to find its entry point
  script due to a bad merge from origin into downstream dist-git. The pod was not
  functional and cycled crash-looping. With this bug fix, the code was synced
  with upstream.
  ([**BZ#1572419**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1572419))
* The Fluentd secure-forward plug-in supports the host name placeholder
  `${hostname}` in the configuration file. Although the value is case-sensitive,
  the upper case string `${HOSTNAME}` was set and it failed to pick up the correct
  hostname of the Fluentd container. The bug is now fixed.
  ([**BZ#1553576**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553576))
* After manually typing a URL with non-existing image, page load messaging would
  remain on the page, signaling that the page load is ongoing, even though it is
  done and the **The image stream details could not be loaded** alert is shown. Set
  the `loaded` scope variable when the image is or is not loaded and use it in the
  view to hide the **loading** messaging. After the attempt to load the image data,
  the **loading** messaging is now hidden, even if the image cannot be loaded.
  ([**BZ#1550797**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550797))
* Previously, the web console would not let you add new keys when editing a
  ConfigMap that was empty. Clicking **Add Item** in the editor would have no
  effect. With this bug fix, you can now correctly add items when editing a
  ConfigMap that has none.
  ([**BZ#1558863**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558863))
* Restricting DaemonSet nodes with the project’s default node selector resulted in
  the deletion and creation of DaemonSet pods in a loop on those nodes that were
  restricted by adding project default node selector. With this bug fix, the
  upstream DaemonSet logic is now updated to be aware of the project’s default
  node selector.
  ([**BZ#1571093**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571093))
* The Hawkular Alerts components has been removed from Hawkular Metrics. This
  change has no functional impact on Hawkular Metrics.
  ([**BZ#1543647**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1543647))
* Previously there was incorrect management of OVS flows. If two nodes rebooted
  and swapped IP addresses when they came back up, then other nodes might not be
  able to send traffic to pods on one or both of those nodes. The code that
  manages OVS flows is now more careful to make the correct changes in cases of
  node IP reassignment. Pod-to-pod traffic should continue to work correctly even
  after nodes swap IP addresses.
  ([**BZ#1570394**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570394))
* The update Egress policy needed blocking outgoing traffic, patching OVS flows,
  and then re-enabling traffic. However, the OVS flow generation for DNS names was
  slow. This resulted in a few seconds of Egress traffic downtime, which may not
  be acceptable. With this bug fix, update Egress policy handling is updated to
  pre-populate all new OVS flows before blocking the outgoing traffic. This
  reduces the downtime during Egress policy updates.
  ([**BZ#1571430**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571430))
* When using per-namespace static egress IPs, all external traffic is routed
  through the egress IP. *External* means all traffic, which is not directed to
  another pod, and so this includes traffic from the pod to the pod’s node. When
  pods are told to use the node’s IP address for DNS, and the pod is using a
  static egress IP, then DNS traffic will be routed to the egress node first, and
  then back to the original node, which might be configured to not accept DNS
  requests from other hosts, causing the pod to be unable to resolve DNS.
  Pod-to-node DNS requests now bypass the egress IP and go directly to the node
  and DNS works.
  ([**BZ#1570398**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1570398))
* This bug fix addresses an issue on the node where setting disabling
  `cpu-cfs-quota` did not prevent CPU CFS limits from being set on pods when
  `cgroups-per-qos` was enabled.
  ([**BZ#1558155**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558155))
* This bug fix addresses an issue where clusters running with OpenStack cloud
  integration have nodes removed when the corresponding instance is stopped. Node
  resources whose instances are stopped are no longer removed from the cluster.
  ([**BZ#1558422**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558422))
* Nodes entered an impaired state when a volume is forcefully detached and not
  rebooted. Any new volume attached to the node is stuck in an attaching state.
  Any node that has a volume stuck in an attaching state for more than 21 minutes
  will be tainted and must be removed from cluster, then added back to remove the
  taint and fix the impaired state of the node. With this bug fix, impaired are
  removed from scheduling, giving the OpenShift Container Platform administrator the ability to
  fix the node and bring it back.
  ([**BZ#1455680**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1455680))
* Previous releases of OpenShift Container Platform would improperly reconfigure `docker` to
  mark the internal registry as insecure when it should not have. This has been
  fixed in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and should no longer happen.
  ([**BZ#1502028**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1502028))

#### Enhancements

* Use CRI-O as an RPM to use CRI-O as the container runtime. To install CRI-O as
  an RPM, set the following two options:

  ```
  openshift_use_crio=True
  openshift_crio_use_rpm=True
  ```

  ([**BZ#1553186**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553186))
* The yedit module now generates unique backup files. Previously, if changes were
  made to the same resource multiple times, only the latest diff would be saved.
  ([**BZ#1555426**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555426))
* Administrators can now see messages for which we are unable to determine the
  proper namespace to associate with them. Otherwise, messages appear to be
  missing and are not viewable for review. A Kibana Index pattern will be created
  for administrators if it does not exist.
  ([**BZ#1519522**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1519522))
* In the absence of inventory values, reuse the values used for the current
  deployment to preserve tuned values. In the case of Elasticsearch, when a user
  had done tuning of the cluster but did not propagate those values into
  variables, upgrading logging would use role default values, which may put the
  cluster in a bad state and lead to loss of log data. Values are now honored in
  order for EFK: inventory → existing environment → role defaults.
  ([**BZ#1561196**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1561196))
* The number of Kibana index-patterns for cluster administrators is now limited.
  Previously, the list was unmanageable and unneeded on large clusters with many
  namespaces. Cluster administrators now only see a limited subset of
  index-patterns.
  ([**BZ#1563230**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1563230))

### RHBA-2018:1796 - OpenShift Container Platform 3.9.30 Bug Fix and Enhancement Update

Issued: 2018-06-06

OpenShift Container Platform release 3.9.30 is now available. The packages and bug fixes
included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2018:1796](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1796) advisory.
The container images included in the update are provided by the
[RHBA-2018:1797](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A1797) advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and images for this release in
the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and details on
the bug fixes and images included in this release.

#### Bug Fixes

* Jenkins no\_proxy processing could not handle suffixes like `".svc"`. As a
  result, communication between a Jenkins Kubernetes agent pod and the Jenkins
  master would attempt to go through a configured `http_proxy` and fail.
  With this bug fix, the OpenShift Container Platform jenkins agent images
  are updated to automatically include the jenkins master and jnlp hosts in
  the `no_proxy` list. The Jenkins limitation for `no_proxy` processing is now
  circumvented.
  ([**BZ#1578989**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1578989))
* When creating the Elasticsearch server certificate, the external
  Elasticsearch host names were unconditionally added to the `subjectAltName`.
  Installation would fail because only host name components beginning with a
  letter are allowed in the `subjectAltName`, so host names like
  `es.0xdeadbeef.com` were disallowed and would cause an error. A warning is
  now issued if the Elasticsearch host name contains a component which does
  not begin with a letter, and it is not added to the `subjectAltName`. Logging
  installation now completes successfully.
  ([**BZ#1567767**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567767))
* The plug-in only caught the `KubeException`, but not more general exceptions.
  Therefore, consumers were stuck cycling until the API server could be contacted.
  Metadata fetch is now more relaxed and gracefully catches the exception,
  returning no metadata, and subsequently the record is orphaned.
  ([**BZ#1560170**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560170))
* `logging-elasticsearch-ops` was missing in the delete` configmaps` list in
  the openshift-ansible `delete_logging` role. The `logging-elasticsearch-ops`
  configmap still exists after running the uninstall Ansible playbook for
  logging. `logging-elasticsearch-ops` is added to the delete configmaps list.
  All of the logging configmaps including `logging-elasticsearch-ops` are now
  uninstalled by running the uninstall Ansible playbook for logging.
  ([**BZ#1549220**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1549220))
* The **Create Project** button was incorrectly displayed to users when they
  had no projects and self-provisioning had been disabled on the projects
  list page of the web console. The action would always fail, so the button
  should have been hidden. The bug is now fixed, and **Create Project** is now
  correctly hidden in the console when self-provisioning is disabled.
  ([**BZ#1577359**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1577359))
* This bug fix addresses an issue pulling images from a private docker hub
  registry.
  ([**BZ#1578088**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1578088))
* This bug fix addresses where `cfs_quota` might still be set on a pod even
  when `cpu-cfs-quota` is set to `false` on the node.
  ([**BZ#1581860**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1581860))

#### Enhancements

* Users are now allowed to disable JSON payload parsing. Parsing each log
  message into JSON and attaching it to the final payload is an expensive
  operation. Fluentd can now be configured to disable parsing of message
  payloads. This is the initial configuration change to deprecating the
  feature from the fluent-plugin-kubernetes\_metadata\_filter.
  ([**BZ#1569825**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1569825))

* The webhook payload can contain an empty commit array, which results in an array indexing error when processed by the API server. As a result, the API server crashes. Check for an empty array before attempting to index into it. With this bug fix, empty commit payloads are handled without crashing the API server.
  ([**BZ#1586076**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1586076))
* A secret with a wrong password causes pull failures for all images. Any public image from the same registry pull will fail. This bug fix adds retry logic for the **401 error** when the password is wrong. Now, if the image is public, the image is pulled and the wrong secret is ignored.
  ([**BZ#1506175**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1506175))
* The `openshift-jenkins-sync` plug-in assumed the Jenkins service and pipeline strategy build were in the same project when constructing the build URL for the OpenShift Container Platform web console. When Jenkins is in one project and the pipeline strategy build is in another project, the view log link in the OpenShift Container Platform web console points to the wrong URL because if cannot find the Jenkins service/route. The `openshift-jenkins-sync` plug-in now looks for the Jenkins service/route in the namespace it is running in. Also, if the user has explicitly configured the root URL in Jenkins, there is greater precedence.
  The URL for a given pipeline strategy build in the OpenShift Container Platform web console now renders correctly.
  ([**BZ#1542460**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1542460))
* Image validation used to validate an old image object and the image signature import controller would generate such an image. As a result, invalid images were pushed to etcd. With this big fix, validation is changed to validate a new image object and logic to fix some invalid images is now introduced. The controller no longer generates invalid images and it is no longer possible to upload an invalid image object.
  ([**BZ#1560311**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560311))
* The transfer of plug-ins from the RPM installation location to the Jenkins home directory were not occurring properly with the OpenShift Container Platform v2 Jenkins RHEL image when Jenkins was previously deployed on an OpenShift Container Platform pod with a persistent volume. An upgrade of the OpenShift Container Platform v2 Jenkins RHEL image would not result in the deployment having the most recent plug-ins associated with the newer image. TheOpenShift Container Platform v2 Jenkins RHEL image `run` script is now updated to properly transfer the plug-ins. An upgrade of the OpenShift Container Platform v2 Jenkins RHEL image now results in the deployment having the most recent plug-ins associated with the newer image.
  ([**BZ#1550193**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1550193))
* If the Jenkins root URL could not be retrieved from the route from the Jenkins template, then the unusable URL could be used in constructing the various annotations for pipeline builds. The associated annotation links would not render when referenced from the OpenShift Container Platform web console. To help account for those edge cases, the sync plug-in now looks for explicitly configured root URLs in Jenkins. The links associated with the pipeline build annotations now render if the root URL is properly configured.
  ([**BZ#1558997**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558997))
* Allowed registries for import configuration settings were considered only for image imports. You could easily get around the image import validation by editing image streams manually and use any desired image. With this bug fix, image streams are now also validated. You cannot use an external image that does not match an entry in whitelisted registry entries.
  ([**BZ#1505315**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1505315))
* In certain cases, an existing etcd installation might not have updated configuration variables, causing services to fail. This bug fix ensures the ***etcd.conf*** file is verified during upgrades and that all variables are set as expected. ([**BZ#1529575**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1529575))
* To enable support for storage devices on Microsoft Azure, the seboolean `virt_use_samba` is required. ([**BZ#1537872**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537872))
* The node configuration file had hardcoded labels in the CRI-O section. Therefore, double labels could occur if labels were set elsewhere in the installer. Remove the unecessary hardcoded labels, eliminatingthe possibility of double labels.
  ([**BZ#1553012**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553012))
* The **secure-forward** template generated in the configMap does not include the `<store>` tag, as mentioned in the documentation. The configuration fails when more stores are defined. Add the enclosing `<store>` tag for the template. Removing the comments provides a syntactically valid configuration.
  ([**BZ#1498398**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1498398))
* To label nodes for Fluentd, a scrip was run out of ***/tmp***. When the `noexec` option was set for ***/tmp***, the playbook failed. Instead of running a script where paused, label with a pause using the `shell` Ansible task. With this bug fix, you are able to pause and run to completion.
  ([**BZ#1588009**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588009))
* There were changes to the kube-proxy iptables rules in upstream Kubernetes. Network performance and overall system performance was severely impacted on extremely large clusters like OpenShift Online. With this bug fix, there are multiple optimizations of the kube-proxy iptables rule and performance problems are resolved.
  ([**BZ#1514174**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1514174))
* A version of the OVS RPM was used that did not have the right SELinux policy. Therefore, OVS failed due to SELinux. Get the correct version of the OVS RPM with the correct rules. With this bug fix, OVS now works.
  ([**BZ#1548677**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1548677))
* When using the static per-project egress IPs feature, egress IPs may stop working in some circumstances if an egress IP is moved from one project to another, or from one node to another. Additionally, if the same egress IP is assigned to two different projects, or two different nodes, then it might not work correctly, even after the duplicate assignment is removed. This bug fix resolves the issue and static per-project egress IPs should work more reliably.
  ([**BZ#1553294**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553294))
* OpenShift Container Platform’s default network plug-in has not been updated to implement the new NetworkPolicy features introduced upstream in Kubernetes (policies for controlling egress, and policies based on IP addresses rather than pods or namespaces). Therefore, in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, creating a NetworkPolicy with an `ipBlock` section would cause nodes to crash, and creating a NetworkPolicy that contained only egress rules would erroneously cause ingress traffic to be blocked. The code is now aware of the unsupported NetworkPolicy features, though it does not yet implement them. If a NetworkPolicy contains `ipBlock` rules, those rules are ignored. This may cause the policy to be treated as `deny all` if the `ipBlock` rule was the only rule in the policy. If a NetworkPolicy contains only egress rules, it is ignored completely and does not affect ingress.
  ([**BZ#1585243**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1585243))
* There was an regression issue in which the docker client in use by the kubelet qualifies image paths without a domain with docker.io client-side, resulting in all unqualified image paths attempting the pull from docker.io and ignoring the domain search list in the docker daemon. With this bug fix, the regression issue is resolved.
  ([**BZ#1588768**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588768))
* Unbinding a template service instance throws an error if the template service instance was deleted. It becomes impossible to unbind a service instance if the template service instance was manually deleted, including if the project containing the TSI was deleted. The template service broker will return **success/gone** in cases where the unbind refers to a non-existent template service instance. The unbind can now proceed even if the TSI no longer exists.
  ([**BZ#1540819**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540819))
* When deleting a namespace, the objects within the namespace are deleted by the namespace controller, not the user. Service bindings, when deleted, get unbound via an unbind request associated with the user doing the deletion. This leads to an unbind request coming from the namespace controller, which did not have all permissions required to perform an unbind. Change what permissions are required for unbind to align them with the permissions the namespace controller has. The unbind triggered by the namespace controller deleting the binding will succeed.
  ([**BZ#1554141**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554141))
* This bug fix adds a small compatibility check to eliminate a pain point with API endpoints changing from 3.7 to 3.9.
  ([**BZ#1554145**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554145))
* You may now define a set of hooks to run arbitrary tasks during the node upgrade process. To implement these hooks, set `openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook`, `openshift_node_upgrade_hook`, or `openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` to the path of the task file you want to execute. `The openshift_node_upgrade_pre_hook` hook is executed after draining the node and before it is upgraded. The `openshift_node_upgrade_hook` is executed after the node has been drained and packages updated but before it is marked schedulable again. The `openshift_node_upgrade_post_hook` hook is executed after the node is marked schedulable immediately before moving on to other nodes.
  ([**BZ#1572786**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1572786))
* Improper input validation of the OpenShift Container Platform routing configuration can cause an entire shard to be brought down. A malicious user can use this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service attack for other users of the router shard.
  ([**BZ#1553035**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553035))
* OpenShift and Atomic Enterprise Ansible deploys a misconfigured etcd file that causes the SSL client certificate authentication to be disabled. Quotations around the values of `ETCD_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` and `ETCD_PEER_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` in ***etcd.conf*** result in etcd being configured to allow remote users to connect without any authentication if they can access the etcd server bound to the network on the master nodes. An attacker could use this flaw to read and modify all the data about the OpenShift Container Platform cluster in the etcd datastore, potentially adding another compute node, or bringing down the entire cluster.
  ([**BZ#1557822**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557822))
* A privilege escalation flaw was found in the source-to-image component of OpenShift Container Platform, which allows the assemble script to run as the root user in a non-privileged container. An attacker can use this flaw to open network connections, and possibly other actions, on the host which are normally only available to a root user. (BZ#1579096)
  ([**BZ#1579096**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1579096))

#### Enhancements

* A new flag is now added to the `oc adm drain` command to allow you to select nodes by label. There was a need to be able to drain multiple nodes, without having to perform the `drain` operation on each individual node. The `oc adm drain` command now supports a `--selector` flag, which results in all nodes matching a given label being drained.
  ([**BZ#1466390**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1466390))

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

#### Bug Fixes

* The link generation code assumed all project logs are written to indices that
  have a common naming pattern. Therefore, users were linked to non-existent
  indices. With this bug fix, project logs that will be archived to different
  indices are annotated with the required information to properly build the link.
  Users are now routed using a link that will query the data store correctly and
  return data.
  ([**BZ#1523047**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1523047))
* The service catalog pods were previously labeled with node selectors that were
  limited to the first master. Now, the pods are properly labeled with a label
  that applies to all masters, which enables service catalog pods to deploy to all
  masters properly.
  ([**BZ#1554623**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554623))
* When adding IP route and host name packages to the `openshift-ansible` image,
  Ansible uses common user-space utilities for determining default facts. The
  `ansible_default_ipv4.address` fact is populated using utilities from the
  **iproute** package, and this fact is used for populating the OpenShift Container Platform IP
  in ***roles/openshift\_facts/library/openshift\_facts.py***.
  ([**BZ#1558689**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1558689))
* Due to corrupt file chunk buffers, Fluentd was blocked processing messages until
  the buffer was removed. This bug fix introduces a handler to remove corrupt
  messages from the processing work flow. Corrupt messages are now sent to a dead
  letter queue while continuing to process other messages and the pipleline is no
  longer blocked.
  ([**BZ#1562004**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1562004))
* Curator checked the readiness of Elasticsearch at startup. If Elasticsearch was
  not ready after one minute, Curator gave up. This was repeated 5 times with
  exponential backoff via pod restart policy with default `backofflimit=5`.
  Curator could not be deployed without Elasticsearch. Now, Curator checks for
  Elasticsearch readiness indefinitely before each run. Curator and Elasticsearch
  can be deployed independently.
  ([**BZ#1564350**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564350))
* Headless service had `service.Spec.ClusterIP=None` set and this was not ignored
  as part of unidling. This generates an incorrect endpoint ID in the HAProxy
  configuration and the configuration will fail to load. This leads to the router
  not servicing any routes. Headless services are now ignored during unidle
  handling and, therefore, there is now no problem with HAProxy configuration
  loading. The router will service routes as expected.
  ([**BZ#1571479**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571479))
* The incoming data had a field `record["event"]` that is a String value and not
  the hash value expected by the `transform_eventrouter code`. This causes the
  code to throw an error and fluentd to emit an error like:

  ```
  error_class=NoMethodError error="undefined method `key?' for \"request\":String"
  ```

  The `transform_eventrouter` code is now changed to only process the
  `record["event"]` field if it is a hash. Records can flow through to
  Elasticsearch again.
  ([**BZ#1588828**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1588828))
* Recently, `cloudResourceSyncManager` was implemented, which continuously fetched
  node addresses from cloud providers. The kubelet then received node addresses
  from the `cloudResourceSyncManager`. At the time of node registration or kubelet
  start, the kubelet fetches node addresses in a blocking loop from
  `cloudResourceSyncManager`. The issue was that `cloudResourceSyncManager` was
  not started before the kubelet had started fetching node addresses from it for
  the first time. Due to this, the kubelet got stuck in the blocking loop and
  never returned. It caused node failures at the network level, and no node could
  be registered. Also, as the kubelet was blocked early, the
  `cloudResourceSyncManager` never got a chance to start. The
  `cloudResourceSyncManager` is now started early in the kubelet startup process
  so that the kubelet does not get blocked on it and `cloudResourceSyncManager` is
  always started.
  ([**BZ#1601813**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1601813))
* Ansible 2.6.0 will not evaluate undefined variables with `|bool` as `false`. You
  must define a `| default(false)` for `logging_elasticsearch_rollout_override`.
  Specify a default on the `when` condition. The playbook executes successfully.
  ([**BZ#1602015**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1602015))

#### Enhancements

* This feature allows the number of indices and replicas to be configured using
  environment variables. The logs collected for infra services consumes a large
  portion of the available disk space. Spreading the data across available nodes
  by modifying the replica and shard settings allow Elasticsearch to better
  support these large amounts of data. This feature results in improved
  performance in Elasticsearch when there are large amounts of data from infra
  services.
  ([**BZ#1553257**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1553257))

bug fixes included in the update are documented in the
[RHBA-2018:3748](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2018%3A3748) advisory.

Space precluded documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements for this
release in the advisory. See the following sections for notes on upgrading and
details on the bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.

#### Bug Fixes

* There were several problems related to updates. Spec changes for instances were
  blocked, even if there was not an ongoing operation; deleting a service instance
  that was updated to an invalid service plan would cause a crash; instances were
  not updated properly if a previous update had failed.
  ([**BZ#1507595**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507595))
* The wizard was setting the `valid` state prior to retrieving data. The primary
  button was set to `Bind` due to prematurely setting the wizard state to `valid`.
  Do not set the wizard state to valid until the data is retrieved and you
  determined that more steps are necessary. At start up, the wizard is now not in
  the `valid` state.
  ([**BZ#1520828**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1520828))
* The playbook for the `openshift-metrics` component was not verifying the return
  code of some commands. Some incorrect parameters could be used to set up
  metrics. The playbook succeeded, but metrics were incorrectly set up. With this
  bug fix, the playbook verifies exit code for `oc apply` commands. Installation
  fails when incorrect commands are used.
  ([**BZ#1534538**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1534538))
* During upgrade, all masters were restarted simultaneously. In a multi-master
  environment, leader election could have failed A short pause is now added
  between master restarts and leader election no longer fails.
  ([**BZ#1540054**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1540054))
* Unicode characters in pull specs for images were treated incorrectly.
  Installation stopped with a cryptic message. Unicode handling in image paths is
  now fixed and a correct error message is displayed.
  ([**BZ#1544648**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544648))
* The default node selector for Elasticsearch was not set. Installation with
  default settings and enabled logging failed. Correct handling of a default node
  selector is now implemented. The logging installation completes without a node
  selector set.
  ([**BZ#1547210**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547210))
* There were bugs in the per-project static IP code. If you removed the static IP
  from a project and then re-added it, it would not always work correctly. With
  this bug fix, removing and re-adding static egress IPs now works.
  ([**BZ#1547899**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1547899))
* Patch files for logging ConfigMaps were incorrectly generated. There were
  failures when applying the file because reference lines were not there. This
  bug fix changes how white-listed lines were handled. They are prevented from
  ending up in patch files that were generated, but the patch is still allowed to
  be applied after. Logging ConfigMaps are now correctly patched based on changes
  from current deployments.
  ([**BZ#1552744**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1552744))
* When fluentd is configured as the combination of collectors and MUX, event logs
  from the event were supposed to be processed by MUX, not by the collector for
  the both `MUX_CLIENT_MODE` maximal and minimal. This occurred because if an event
  log is formatted in the collector (the event record is put under the Kubernetes
  key), the log is forwarded to MUX and passed to the k8s-meta plug-in there and
  the existing Kubernetes record is overwritten. It removed the event information
  from the log.
  +
  **Fix 1**: To avoid the replacement, if the log is from event router,
  the tag is rewritten to `${tag}.raw` in ***input-post-forward-mux.conf***, which
  treats the log in the `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=minimal` way.
  +
  **Fix 2**: There was another
  bug in Ansible in that the environment variable `TRANSFORM_EVENTS` was not set
  in MUX even if `openshift_logging_install_eventrouter` was set to `true`.
  +
  With these two fixes, the event logs are correctly logged when MUX is configured
  with `MUX_CLIENT_MODE=maximal` as well as `minimal`.
  ([**BZ#1554293**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1554293))
* The ability to skip disabling swap by use of `openshift_disable_swap=False` is
  removed from OpenShift Container Platform 3.9. This feature was undocumented and should not
  be used.
  ([**BZ#1557200**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1557200))
* The kube-proxy and kubelet parts of the OpenShift Container Platform node process were being
  given different default values for the config options describing how to interact
  with iptables. OpenShift Container Platform would periodically add a bogus iptables rule that
  would cause some per-project static egress IPs to not be used for some length of
  time, until the bogus rule was removed again. While the bogus rule was present,
  traffic from those projects would use the node IP address of the node hosting
  the egress IP, rather than the egress IP itself. The inconsistent configuration
  was resolved, causing the bogus iptables rule to no longer be added. Projects
  now consistently use their static egress IPs.
  ([**BZ#1560584**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1560584))
* A node selector for TSB was not documented. Therefore, users were not aware that
  `template_service_broker_selector` and `openshift_hosted_infra_selector` could
  be changed. With this bug fix, `hosts.example` now lists
  `openshift_hosted_infra_selector` and `template_service_broker_selector`. TSB
  and the infra node selector is now more visible.
  ([**BZ#1569165**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1569165))
* Kibana index pattern seeding was modified to reduce the number of entries in the
  drop-list that were visible to cluster admins. Cluster admins navigating to
  Kibana for logging from the web console were no longer sent to the correct URL.
  Take into consideration a user’s `cluster-admin` role when creating the web
  console link to pod logs in Kibana. With this bug fix, the link is now created
  correctly.
  ([**BZ#1598305**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1598305))
* The unstaller attempted to deploy `node_exporter` during a Prometheus uninstall.
  Uninstall failed due to `node_exporter` not being able to deploy to the
  Prometheus namespace. This bug fix adds a check to deploy `node_exporter` if
  Prometheus is installed and present. Now, Prometheus uninstall completes
  successfully without attempting to install `node_exporter` into the non-existent
  namespace.
  ([**BZ#1598642**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1598642))
* In certain environments, the image stream content changes rapidly enough to
  prevent replacement with new content due to the object being modified. The
  upgrade would fail. The image stream update now retries three times. With this
  bug fix, the upgrade should be successful.
  ([**BZ#1623642**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1623642))
* When wildcard routes are enabled and namespace ownership checks are disabled,
  non-wildcard routes get removed and immediately re-added on the resync interval
  boundaries and this causes a brief route outage and results in intermittent
  errors on a route. Do not remove and re-add the routes on resync interval in the
  specific case when wildcard routes enabled and namespace ownership checks are
  disabled. With this bug fix, non-wildcard routes continue to serve without any
  intermittent errors.
  ([**BZ#1624078**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1624078))
* Javascript runtime errors are caused by accessing an undefined key on the
  secrets object. Use the `lodash _.get()` method, which will not error out if
  accessing an undefined key on the secrets object. The secrets drop-down is now a
  visible event if there is a secret without any data.
  ([**BZ#1633285**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1633285))
* `openshift_facts` uses default images to determine the version in a
  containerized installation. When custom images and the internal registry is
  used, the default images cannot be pulled. Therefore, `openshift.common.version`
  is left empty and the upgrade fails when OpenShift Container Platform is not installed. If
  there is a `custom_image` name, pass it to `openshift_facts` to use. With this
  bug fix, `openshift.common.version` is set in containerized installations with
  the registry mirror and installation succeeds.
  ([**BZ#1634004**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1634004))
* Systemd has a default service timeout of 90 seconds and, in some cases,
  `ovsdb-server` does not start up in that time. Therefore, openvswitch, which has
  a dependency on `ovsdb-server`, cannot start and installation fails. Increase
  systemd timeout for `ovsdb-server` to five minutes. As a result, `ovsdb-server`
  does not timeout and openvswitch starts successfully.
  ([**BZ#1636234**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1636234))
* The OSB Client Library used by the Service Catalog controller pod was not
  closing and freeing TCP connections used to communicate with brokers. Over a
  period of time, many TCP connections would remain open and, eventually, the
  communication between the Service Catalog controller and brokers would fail.
  Additionally, the pod would become unresponsive. Use a new version of the OSB
  Client Library, which contains a fix to close connections when finishing a HTTP
  request and free idle connections.
  ([**BZ#1638726**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638726))
* When using docker with log-driver journald, the setting in
  ***/etc/sysconfig/docker*** has changed to use `--log-driver journald` instead of
  `--log-driver=journald`. Fluentd cannot detect that journald is being used, so
  assumes `json-file`, and cannot read any kubernetes metadata because it does
  notlook for the journald `CONTAINER_NAME` field. This results in lots of Fluentd
  errors. Change the way Fluentd detects the docker log driver so that it looks
  for `--log-driver journald` in addition to ``--log-driver=journald`. Fluentd can
  now detect the docker log driver, and can correctly process Kubernetes container
  logs. ([**BZ#1638900**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1638900))
* The master API sent an error without details, but the registry was not ready for
  this and the registry panicked. Check if the `details` field is available. The
  registry sends a proper error to the client and logs the full error from the
  master API.
  ([**BZ#1639839**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1639839))
* Running `oc logs $fluentd_pod` suggests that you run `oc exec <pod_name>
  /opt/app-root/src/utils/logs`, which includes the non-existing utility logs
  path. Therefore, `oc exec <pod_name> /opt/app-root/src/utils/logs` fails with
  **no such file or directory**. This bug fix updates the suggested command line to
  `oc exec <pod_name> — logs` since the utility `logs` is now in the ***PATH***
  and there is no need to specify the full path. As a result, `oc logs
  $fluentd_pod` suggests the correct command line to show the fluentd logs.
  ([**BZ#1643340**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643340))
* There was inconsistent user usage when creating and removing temporary
  directories. Removing the directories can fail if the user does not have proper
  access. With this bug fix update, tasks use same `become:false settings` and the
  removal does not fail when using different user.
  ([**BZ#1643732**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643732))
* Unnecessarily short timeout resulted in a failure to reuse artifacts from a
  previous build when incremental builds were selected with s2i. This could occur
  when the size of the artifacts being reused was particularly large or the host
  system was running particularly slowly. Invalid artifacts could be used in a
  subsequent build, or artifacts would be recreated instead of reused resulting in
  performance degradation. Timeout has been increased to a sufficiently large
  value as to avoid this problem. Artifact reuse should no longer timeout.
  ([**BZ#1644343**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644343))
* Prometheus was automatically discovering two separate scrape endpoints for the
  Kubernetes router. One of the endpoints was not able to be scraped due to a
  missing auth config. This appeared as a failing scrape in the Prometheus status.
  This bug fix removed the duplicate prometheus scrape endpoint for the Kubernetes
  router. Now, Prometheus only scrapes a single, working endpoint for the
  Kubernetes router.
  ([**BZ#1644544**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1644544))
* Egress IP-related iptables rules were not recreated if they were deleted. If a
  user restarted firewalld or `iptables.service` on a node that hosted egress IPs,
  then those egress IPs would stop working. Traffic that should have used the
  egress IP would use the node’s normal IP instead. Egress IP iptables rules are
  now recreated if they are removed and egress IPs work reliably.
  ([**BZ#1653382**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1653382))
* Previously, the metrics playbooks attempted to verify the availability of the
  `python-passlib` library in a manner that was unpredictable. This library is also
  a dependency of the `openshift-ansible` packaging, so there is no need for this
  additional check and it is now removed.
  ([**BZ#1654887**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1654887))

#### Enhancements

* Master nodes are now schedulable. Web console pods are now restricted to only
  run on masters. Therefore, master nodes are no longer marked as non-schedulable.
  ([**BZ#1535673**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535673))
* The APB tool now works with Minishift.
  ([**BZ#1536687**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1536687))

#### Known Issues

* There is a regression error when running on OpenStack. The function
  `normalize_openstack_facts` pulled in a commit that broke how the inventory file
  is parsed when hosted on OpenStack. When using OpenStack without a floating
  IP for your cluster, you will see an error. To address this issue, you must
  manually patch the
  ***/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/init/cluster\_facts.yml*** file
  with:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-05-17 00:22:38 UTC  ``` OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Online have a flaw in the source-to-image functionality. An attacker that can create images with the 'io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user' LABEL set to 'root' can execute arbitrary code with full privileges in the builder pod during S2I build.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c6)  Jason Shepherd    2018-05-28 03:54:07 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jeremy Choi (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 18:01:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9  Via RHSA-2018:2013 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2013](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2013)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1579096#c12)  Scott Gayou    2018-11-14 16:18:02 UTC  ``` RHSCL release was packaged before io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user functionality was added to source-to-image.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1580538#c0)  emahoney    2018-05-21 17:51:39 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Unable to disallow project creation from system:authentcated users after upgrade to 3.9. In 3.7 prior to the upgrade, we were able to protect the role after removing the group from the rolebinding. Currently in 3.9, it looks like the protect is working, but the OCP RBAC object does not exist after removing the group from the rolebinding. So when the master services are restarted, the rolebinding is re-created (not protected anymore).    Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.9.14-1  How reproducible: Every time   Steps to Reproduce:  ~~~ [root@master-0 cloud-user]# yum list installed | grep atomic-openshift.x86_64 Repodata is over 2 weeks old.

Instead do as follows.
