            "Cvss_score": "Not Specified"
        },
        "Vulnerability Details": {
            "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the source-to-image (s2i) component, specifically in how the `io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user` LABEL is handled during the build process. If this label is set to 'root', the assemble script within the builder pod executes as the root user.",
            "Weaknesses": [
                "The source-to-image functionality allows for the `io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user` label to be set to 'root'.",
                "The assemble script inside a non-privileged container runs as root when the `io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user` is set to root."
            ],
            "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code with full privileges in the builder pod during an S2I build, by setting the `io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user` label to root. This allows for actions normally only available to a root user, such as opening network connections.",
            "Attack vectors": "An attacker can create images with the 'io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user' LABEL set to 'root'.",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to create images with the specific 'io.openshift.s2i.assemble-user' label set to 'root'. This could be achieved if the attacker has the necessary permissions within the OpenShift environment or if they compromise a system that can perform these builds."
