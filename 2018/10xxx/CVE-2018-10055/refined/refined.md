- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A maliciously crafted configuration file passed into the TensorFlow XLA compiler.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Invalid memory access and/or a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A maliciously crafted configuration file could cause TensorFlow to crash or read from other parts of its process memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Passing a crafted configuration file to the TensorFlow XLA compiler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious configuration file to the TensorFlow XLA compiler.
