The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10121.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "name" field of the 404 error page within the Monstra CMS admin panel, specifically in the `monstra-3.0.4/plugins/box/pages/pages.admin.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious payload in the database without proper sanitization. When the 404 error page is rendered, the stored JavaScript payload executes in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "name" field of the 404 error page that will execute in the context of an administrator's session. This can allow an attacker to take over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attacker injects the malicious payload via the admin interface when editing the 404 page.
- The XSS is triggered when a user visits a non-existing page on the site, causing the 404 page, containing the stored XSS, to load.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have editor-level privileges in the Monstra CMS admin panel to access the page editing functionalities.
