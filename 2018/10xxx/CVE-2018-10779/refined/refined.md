{
  "CVE-2018-10779": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the TIFFWriteScanline function within tif_write.c. This occurs due to an integer overflow in TIFFSetupStrips which allocates a buffer smaller than necessary, leading to the over-read in TIFFWriteScanline when accessing the array.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in `TIFFSetupStrips` leads to an undersized buffer allocation, causing a heap-based buffer over-read in `TIFFWriteScanline`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to application crashes. It may potentially allow for arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted TIFF image file via a vulnerable application or system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to trick a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted TIFF image."
