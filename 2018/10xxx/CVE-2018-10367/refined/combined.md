## Two Stored-XSS when post an article

### Steps to Reproduce

1、Login the backstage

<http://localhost/wuzhicms-master/www/index.php?m=core&f=index&v=login&_su=wuzhicms>

2、Go to content management, choose an existing one or post a new on to edit

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19260696/39188196-bf7a1aaa-4801-11e8-8ad0-b246e29203bd.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19260696/39188196-bf7a1aaa-4801-11e8-8ad0-b246e29203bd.png)

3、There are two Stored-XSS,

a)the first one lie in the title section

b)the secone lie the the content section(you need to change to source code mode)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19260696/39188417-53a8357c-4802-11e8-9506-d01f21383d78.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19260696/39188417-53a8357c-4802-11e8-9506-d01f21383d78.png)

4、Save and we can see the page we just edit, the title is too obvious

5、Anyway

a)title section
