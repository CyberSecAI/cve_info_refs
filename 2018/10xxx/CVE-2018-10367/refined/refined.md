Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-provided data in the title and content sections of articles within the Wuzhi CMS. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present:
  -   **Title Section XSS:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the title of an article.
  -   **Content Section XSS:** Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the content of an article, specifically when editing in source code mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected article.
  - This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Other malicious behaviors

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the following steps:
  1.  An attacker with administrator privileges logs into the Wuzhi CMS backend.
  2.  The attacker navigates to the content management section and selects an existing article or creates a new one.
  3.  The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into either:
     - The title field
     - The content field (in source code mode)
  4.  The attacker saves the article.
  5.  When a user views the modified article, the injected JavaScript will execute in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  -   The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the backend of the Wuzhi CMS.
  -   The attacker must be able to create or edit articles.
