Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `registration_settings.php` file within the iScripts eSwap application. Specifically, the `ddlFree` parameter within this file is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user input provided through the `ddlFree` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially manipulating database operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** It might be possible for an attacker to gain administrative access by manipulating the database.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker might be able to disrupt database operations, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `registration_settings.php` script.
- **`ddlFree` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter `ddlFree` is present within the body of the POST request and used in an unsanitized manner in a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the iScripts eSwap application.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/eswap/demo//admin/registration_settings.php`) and how to craft a malicious HTTP POST request.
- **Authentication:** The attacker would need to authenticate to the admin panel to reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `ddlFree`
- **Vulnerable File:** `registration_settings.php`
- **SQL Injection Payload Example:** `ddlFree= 1' order by 10 #`
- **Observed Behavior:** The server returns an SQL error indicating an "Unknown column '10' in 'order clause'", confirming the injection vulnerability.
