Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the processing of WbXML string extensions within the OMACP (Open Mobile Alliance Client Provisioning) protocol implementation on Samsung devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow during memory allocation for the string extension portion of the WbXML payload. When the size of the string extension is maliciously crafted to cause an integer overflow, it results in allocating a smaller-than-required memory buffer.
- **Memory Corruption:**  When the string data is then written to this undersized buffer, it leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, corrupting memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the target device due to memory corruption and segmentation fault. The provided crash log confirms this: "signal 11 (SIGSEGV), code 2 (SEGV_ACCERR)".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **WAP Push Message:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WAP push SMS message containing a malicious WbXML payload.
- **Pre-authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the WbXML payload, specifically when handling the string extension, and happens before any authentication checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send SMS:** The attacker needs the ability to send SMS messages to the target device.
- **Malicious WbXML Payload Creation:**  The attacker must be able to craft a WAP push message containing a specific WbXML payload designed to trigger the integer overflow.
- **SMS Permission (for testing):**  To replicate the attack, a test application requires SMS permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit information includes a sample WAP payload and a test application to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on a Samsung S7 Edge device with build number `NRD90M.G93FXXU1DQJ8`.
-  The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research.
