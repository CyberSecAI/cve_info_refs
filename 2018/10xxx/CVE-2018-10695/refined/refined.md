Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10695:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the email alert functionality of the Moxa AWK-3121 device. Specifically, the POST parameters "to1, to2, to3, to4" are vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The device's web server (iw_webs - GoAhead) does not properly validate the size of the input provided to the "to1, to2, to3, to4" POST parameters within the email alert functionality. This allows an attacker to send a large amount of data, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** A successful buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attacker can use a crafted XSRF form to trick a legitimate administrator into submitting a malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web server.
*   The attacker needs to trick an administrator into submitting a crafted form (XSRF).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the device's email alert functionality.
*   The POST parameters "to1, to2, to3, to4" are vulnerable.
*   A string of 678 characters in the vulnerable parameters can trigger the buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerable component is the "iw_webs" web server (GoAhead).
