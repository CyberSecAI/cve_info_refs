Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper validation of user-supplied input within the `formRequestDomains` class, specifically the `hidDomains` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The advisory states that the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed, although it's not detailed how. This implies a vulnerability exists that allows bypassing authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements, which, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, leads to code execution with root privileges.
- **Complete Compromise:** Due to the root context, exploitation could lead to full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N).
- **Through the vulnerable parameter:** The specific attack vector involves crafting malicious SQL queries within the `hidDomains` parameter of the `formRequestDomains` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable application.
- **Bypassed Authentication:** Although authentication is required, the attacker needs to be able to bypass this mechanism, implying an authentication bypass vulnerability exists alongside the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** Attackers must know how to interact with the `hidDomains` parameter within the `formRequestDomains` class.
