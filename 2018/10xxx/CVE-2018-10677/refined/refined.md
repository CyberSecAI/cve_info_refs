The provided content relates to CVE-2018-10677.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `WritePixels` function of the ngiflib library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `WritePixels` function when writing pixel data to a buffer allocated in the `LoadGif` function. The size of the buffer is not correctly calculated or checked against the dimensions of the GIF image, resulting in a write out-of-bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a crafted GIF file to a program that uses the vulnerable ngiflib library. The crafted GIF will contain dimensions or data that causes the heap buffer to be overflowed during the `WritePixels` function call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed GIF file to an application utilizing the ngiflib library. This typically involves the attacker being able to control the input data of the application.
