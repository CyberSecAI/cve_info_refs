# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[CVE-2018-10895](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgmx-52ph-qqcw "CVE-2018-10895"): Fix CSRF issues with qute://settings/set URL

```
In [ffc29ee](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/ffc29ee043ae7336d9b9dcc029a05bf7a3f994e8) (part of v1.0.0), a
qute://settings/set URL was added to change settings.

Contrary to what I apparently believed at the time, it *is* possible for
websites to access `qute://*` URLs (i.e., neither QtWebKit nor QtWebEngine
prohibit such requests, other than the usual cross-origin rules).

In other words, this means a website can e.g. have an `<img>` tag which loads a
`qute://settings/set` URL, which then sets `editor.command` to a bash script.
The result of that is arbitrary code execution.

Fixes [#4060](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4060)
See [#2332](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2332)

Subject: CVE-2018-10895: Remote code execution due to CSRF in qutebrowser

Description
-----------

Due to a CSRF vulnerability affecting the `qute://settings` page, it was
possible for websites to modify qutebrowser settings. Via settings like
`editor.command`, this possibly allowed websites to execute arbitrary code.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-10895:
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10895>

Affected versions
-----------------

The issue was introduced in v1.0.0, as part of commit ffc29ee.
<https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/ffc29ee>

It was fixed in the v1.4.1 release, in commit 43e58ac.
<https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/43e58ac865ff862c2008c510fc5f7627e10b4660>

All releases between v1.0.0 and v1.4.0 (inclusive) are affected.
Backported patches are available, but no additional releases are planned:

v1.1.x: <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/ff686ff7f395d83e5ac48507ecfae0b0e97a61ef>
v1.2.x: <https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/c3361c31b370140f323e481dd455450b1e74c099>

Timeline
--------

2018-07-09: I was made aware of the original issue privately (initially
believed by the reporter to only be a DoS issue), developed a fix and contacted
the distros Openwall mailinglist to organize a disclosure date to give
distributions time to coordinate releasing of a fix.

2018-07-10: Slightly updated patch sent to the distros mailinglist.

2018-07-11: Public disclosure.

Mitigation
----------

Please upgrade to v1.4.1 or apply the patches above.

Note that disabling loading of `autoconfig.yml` is not a suitable remedy, since
settings are still applied until the next restart.

As a workaround, it's possible to patch out the vulnerable code via a
`config.py` file:

    from qutebrowser.browser import qutescheme
    qutescheme._qute_settings_set = lambda url: ('text/html', '')

While there is no known exploit for this in the wild, users are advised to
check their `autoconfig.yml` file (located in the config folder shown in
`:version`) for any unwanted modifications.
