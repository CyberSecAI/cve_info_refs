Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10895:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw in qutebrowser's handling of `qute://settings/set` URLs. This allowed arbitrary websites to make requests to this URL and modify the browser's settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The `qute://settings/set` URL was accessible via external websites without proper protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Lack of origin validation:** The browser didn't properly validate the origin of requests to the `qute://settings/set` URL, allowing malicious websites to manipulate settings.
- **Ability to modify sensitive settings:** The vulnerability allowed external sites to modify sensitive settings, such as `editor.command`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By setting the `editor.command` setting to a malicious script, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
- **Configuration manipulation:** Malicious websites could modify other browser settings, potentially leading to further security compromises or privacy breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** A malicious website could embed an `<img>` tag or use other methods (e.g. forms, links, redirects) to make requests to `qute://settings/set` URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Attacker-controlled website:** The attacker needs to host or control a website that the victim visits.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to visit the attacker's malicious website.
- **Vulnerable browser version:** The user must be using a qutebrowser version between v1.0.0 and v1.4.0 (inclusive).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.0.0 and fixed in version 1.4.1.
- The fix involved implementing CSRF protection for `qute://settings/set` URLs by using a token.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the provided patches or upgrading to version 1.4.1 or higher.
- A workaround is available which involves patching out the vulnerable code via a `config.py` file.
