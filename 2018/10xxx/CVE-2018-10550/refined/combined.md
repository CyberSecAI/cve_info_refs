## Description

[![@mayuanyang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3387099?u=11e04fcfa8d44a7378fd977149611f21337aea42&v=4&size=48)](/mayuanyang)[mayuanyang](https://github.com/mayuanyang)opened [on Apr 6, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4454#issue-311836201)

Ticket: <https://help.octopus.com/t/users-role-is-not-filtering-accessible-deployment-targets-based-on-tenant/19298/8>

## Why

Currently there is no restriction on machines that based on the scoped tenants, the restriction only apply on scoped environments

## What can we do?

Apply the restrictions to machines based on scoped tenant. Check the filter logic in this class `InaccessibleVariablesWillBeRemovedRule`

## The complication

Deployment target tenant setting can be `Untenanted`, `Tenanted or Untenanted` and `Tenanted`

* Tenant scoped users should not be able to see untenanted machines
* Tenant scoped users should not be able to see machine that does not scoped to the tenant
* Untenanted users should not be able to see tenanted only machines
* Should be more to add, let's have this one to start with

## It is bad

Did a test that user scoped to 1 tenant `T1`

Project connected to tenants `T1`, `T2` and `T3`

Deployment can only be made to `T1`

Thought that the user cannot deploy to the tenants that he does not have permission, but it does not prevent from other users from doing the deployment.

The impact: User can scope a variable to a machine that he is not allowed to with malicious value. He can then wait for another user with enough permission to deploy a release. malicious value will then get deployed to production.
