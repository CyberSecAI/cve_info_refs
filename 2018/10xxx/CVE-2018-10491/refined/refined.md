    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D Bone Weight Modifier structures. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure.",
    "root_cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing U3D Bone Weight Modifier structures, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-Bounds Write"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited when the target visits a malicious page or opens a malicious file.",
