{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flawed privilege escalation mechanism that allows an ordinary user to gain administrative privileges by manipulating the `eff_uid` value in the session cookie.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `get_effective_uid` function retrieves the effective user ID from the session cookie data.",
      "The session cookie data is vulnerable to manipulation.",
       "The anti-forgery check can be bypassed because it's based on fixed values.",
        "The password hash check in `_check_passhash` uses a weak comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "An ordinary user can elevate their privileges to that of an administrator, gaining full control over the CMS Made Simple instance.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can manipulate the session cookie to include a forged `eff_uid` value corresponding to an admin user. They must also bypass the anti-forgery check and provide a valid `cksum` value.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have an existing account on the CMS instance with ordinary user privileges and knowledge of the fixed values used in the anti-forgery check and a way to generate valid `cksum` value."
