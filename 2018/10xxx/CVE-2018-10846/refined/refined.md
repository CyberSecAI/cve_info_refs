Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a cache-based side-channel flaw in the way GnuTLS implements CBC-mode cipher suites. This vulnerability is exploitable through a novel "Just in Time" PRIME + PROBE attack, combined with a variation of the Lucky 13 attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cache-based Side-Channel:** The core weakness lies in the timing differences of memory accesses during cryptographic operations (specifically, CBC-mode ciphers). An attacker can exploit these differences to gain information about the processed data.
*   **"Just in Time" PRIME + PROBE Attack:**  This is a specific technique where an attacker probes the CPU cache to deduce which memory locations have been recently accessed by the victim's process.
*   **Lucky 13 Attack:** This attack originally targeted the timing differences in how MACs are calculated. This vulnerability is related to the Lucky 13 attack, but it is not the same vulnerability, instead the attacker leverages a variant of this attack to recover the plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Plaintext Recovery:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to recover plaintext from encrypted TLS sessions.
*   **Cross-VM Attack Scenario:** The vulnerability is particularly effective in cross-VM environments, which suggests it can be used in cloud-based infrastructure where VMs of different users may exist on the same hardware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** Exploitation occurs over the network, by sending specifically crafted TLS packets to a vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they do not need physical access to the victim's system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to establish network connections with the victim's GnuTLS-enabled service.
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to measure timing differences during the processing of TLS records by the victim. This is usually done by measuring round-trip times.
*   **Cross-VM Environment:** Exploitation is especially effective in a cross-VM environment when the attacker VM is hosted on the same physical machine as the victim VM, or has a means of measuring the timing characteristics of the victim VM process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "Just in Time" PRIME + PROBE attack combined with a new variant of the Lucky 13 attack, which highlights a novel approach compared to the original Lucky 13.
*   The provided documents indicate that patches have been released and deployed in various affected systems, including Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
*   The severity was rated as 'Moderate' by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability affects GnuTLS implementations using CBC-mode cipher suites.
*   The vulnerability is a result of "pseudo constant time" counter measures that weren't sufficient to completely prevent the exploit.

This analysis provides a detailed picture of the vulnerability, its exploitability, and potential impact, which is more comprehensive than the initial CVE description.
