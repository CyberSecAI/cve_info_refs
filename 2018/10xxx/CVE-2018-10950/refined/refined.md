- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application displays detailed error messages, including stack dumps and user context information, when errors or exceptions occur.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure through verbose error messages. Inconsistent error handling leading to HTTP 500 errors or HTTP 200 responses with detailed error information within the response body.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain information about the application and database, which could be used to conduct further attacks. This includes system data, debugging information, stack traces, database exceptions, error details, and user context dumps.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by triggering errors or exceptions within the application, causing the system to return verbose error messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that generates errors or exceptions. The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
