| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=108963#c0)  Sandesh Almeida    2018-05-09 11:32:55 EDT  ``` The application displays detailed error messages when an error or exception occurs. Detailed technical error messages can allow an adversary to gain information about the application and database that could be used to conduct further attacks.  Information disclosure occurs when system data or debugging information could be misused to help an attacker learn or gather information about the system. Such leaks of sensitive information can appear in comments, browsable sources or through error messages such as stack traces, database exceptions and error details.  During the analysis of the various interfaces of Zimbra, Netragard noticed that:      Error handling is not always consistent: the system will return either an HTTP 500, either an HTTP 200 with an error within the response body (incl. stack dump or tracing data);     Error messages are returned along with a complete dump of the current user context;     Stack dumps are sometimes appearing in JSON structures. ``` |  |
