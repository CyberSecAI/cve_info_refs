Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Main heading" and "Sub heading" fields within the "Partial Branding" settings of the SynaMan web application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it stores the malicious script input and executes it when other users navigate the web app.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover:** If the targeted user has elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially hijack their session and gain control of the application.
*   **Data theft:** The attacker could steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data by injecting JavaScript.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can inject JavaScript code to change the look and feel of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the SynaMan application.
*   **Specific Input Fields:** The attacker manipulates the "Main heading" and "Sub heading" fields found within the `Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Partial Branding` section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have admin-level access to the SynaMan web console.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser to access the application.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit is stored and triggered upon navigation through the web app.
*   Although Chrome blocks the XSS payload upon initial submission, by navigating back and then selecting "Explore" the payload is stored and activated.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in a later release.
