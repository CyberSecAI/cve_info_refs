  "CVE-2018-10323": {
    "description": "Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate meta-data information.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of metadata in XFS filesystem"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) by mounting a maliciously crafted XFS image.",
      "attack_vector": "A local attacker can mount a specially crafted XFS image to trigger the vulnerability.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to mount a filesystem on the target system."
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "Linux kernel",
       "Ubuntu 18.04 ESM",
      "Ubuntu 16.04 ESM",
      "Ubuntu 14.04 ESM",
       "Debian stretch"
    ],
    "additional_information": "A patch was proposed to set the format back to extents if `xfs_bmap_extents_to_btree` fails which can cause a NULL pointer dereference.\nThis vulnerability is related to a metadata corruption detected in `xfs_agf_verify` which causes a crash due to an invalid pointer dereference in xfs_bmapi_write()."
