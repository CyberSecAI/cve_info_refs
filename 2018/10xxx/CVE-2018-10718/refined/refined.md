Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.
- The `SV_ExecuteClientMessage` function in Call of Duty games does not properly validate the length of compressed data before passing it to `MSG_ReadBitsCompress`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of bounds checking:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check to ensure that the size of the compressed data being read from the client message does not exceed the allocated buffer size on the stack.
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  When the received compressed data is larger than the allocated buffer, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system (the game host).
- **Game Manipulation:** The exploit can be used to alter the game state, such as changing maps, displaying HUD elements, and modifying player speeds.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker has the potential to escalate the attack to further compromise the host's system beyond the game itself (e.g., accessing the file system, downloading and executing files).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted network packet sent to a Call of Duty game server.
- **Client-Server Interaction:** The vulnerability lies in the game server's handling of client messages, specifically during decompression of data from network packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to a vulnerable game server. This is typically achieved by playing on a server that is vulnerable, making the client in the server-client relationship the attacker.
- **Packet Crafting:**  The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a malicious network packet that contains compressed data with a length that exceeds the expected buffer size.
- **Understanding of game protocol:**  The attacker needs to reverse engineer the game's network protocol to be able to craft valid packets with the malicious payload.
- **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) knowledge:** The exploit uses ROP to gain arbitrary code execution in the game. This involves crafting a sequence of code snippets already present in the game process to achieve desired execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a detailed explanation on how the ROP chain was crafted to call `VirtualAlloc`, write shellcode, and then execute it, thus exploiting the buffer overflow.
- The exploit leverages the game's usage of thread local storage to restore context after hijacking the control flow using setjmp/longjmp, preventing crashes and keeping the game running normally.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Call of Duty games.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available, demonstrating map changes, HUD alterations and movement speed changes.
