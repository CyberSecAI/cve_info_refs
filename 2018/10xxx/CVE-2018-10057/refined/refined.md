Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `save` API command in cgminer and bfgminer uses `fopen()` on an unsanitized user-provided parameter, allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: The application fails to validate or sanitize the filename provided by the user to the `save` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write the miner's configuration file to any location on the server accessible by the miner process. This could be used to overwrite files with the miner's config or other malicious content, potentially leading to further attacks like Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Limited control over content**: The content is the miner's configuration file

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via the miner's API interface.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the API, granted through IP/Subnet-based ACLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the target machine on the API port.
*   **Authenticated API Access:** The attacker must be on a network/IP that is allowed to send write commands to the API. This is controlled by the `--api-allow` option.
*   **Knowledge of API Command:**  The attacker needs to know the `save` command to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `dosave` function calls `fopen()` directly with the user-supplied parameter, without any path validation.
*   The configuration file written can be used to plant malicious code in locations like web roots
*   The vulnerability is present in both `cgminer` and `bfgminer` due to a shared codebase.
*   The vendor considered this behavior to be "intended" and "not a bug."
