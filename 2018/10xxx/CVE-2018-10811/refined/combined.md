# CVE-2018-16152

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16151.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16227.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16152 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16152)

#### Description

In verify\_emsa\_pkcs1\_signature() in gmp\_rsa\_public\_key.c in the gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation based on GMP does not reject excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters field during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4790 and CVE-2014-1568.

## Release and vulnerability announcements for strongSwan

* [Blog](/blog/)
* [2018](/blog/2018)
* [strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2018-10811)](/blog/2018/05/28/strongswan-vulnerability-%28cve-2018-10811%29.html)

## strongSwan Vulnerability (CVE-2018-10811)

May 28, 2018

A denial-of-service vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if the openssl plugin is used in FIPS
mode and HMAC-MD5 is negotiated as PRF was discovered, all strongSwan versions since 5.0.1 may be affected.

[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)[5.6.x](/blog/tags/5.6.x)[5.5.x](/blog/tags/5.5.x)[5.4.x](/blog/tags/5.4.x)[5.3.x](/blog/tags/5.3.x)[5.2.x](/blog/tags/5.2.x)[5.1.x](/blog/tags/5.1.x)[5.0.x](/blog/tags/5.0.x)

One of our users privately reported a denial-of-service vulnerability in strongSwan. All strongSwan versions since 5.0.1 are potentially affected, depending on the configuration. However, it's important to note that many, if not most, installations won't be affected.

### Missing Initialization of a Variable in IKEv2 Key Derivation

The variable storing the SKEYSEED for IKEv2 key derivation is not initialized before using the negotiated PRF. If setting the PRF's key, or using it fails, an attempt to clear the memory to which the uninitialized variable points may cause a crash. Potentially affected are all strongSwan versions since 5.0.1, depending on the configuration.

[CVE-2018-10811](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-10811) has been assigned for this vulnerability.

The keys for IKEv2 are derived from the DH secret and nonces by applying the negotiated PRF to compute SKEYSEED, which is then itself used as key to the PRF+ to derive all the keys required for the IKE and Child SAs.

The code in question looks like this:

```
    /* SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir) */
    if (this->prf->set_key(this->prf, fixed_nonce) &&
        this->prf->allocate_bytes(this->prf, secret, &skeyseed) &&
        this->prf->set_key(this->prf, skeyseed))
    {
        prf_plus = prf_plus_create(this->prf, TRUE, prf_plus_seed);
    }

    ...

    chunk_clear(&skeyseed);

```

If either set\_key() or allocate\_bytes() fails, skeyseed will not be initialized and chunk\_clear() will attempt to write a block of zero bytes to the uninitialized pointer (of a similarly uninitialized length). This will usually result in a crash.

Versions before 5.0.1 are not affected as the two functions had no return value yet - and even now they are generally not expected to fail. Actually, in our own plugins, allocate\_bytes() always initializes the passed variable, so the main focus is set\_key().

As its name suggests, it takes the given key and copies it so some internal buffer. Depending on the key size and the PRF this might require padding, or the application of the underlying (hash) algorithm to shorten it. But this generally doesn't fail and in most of our own implementations the involved functions simply return TRUE.

However, when using plugins that rely on third-party libraries, such as the *openssl* plugin, the two functions may fail depending on the return value of called library functions. It's still not something that is expected to occur in general.

But there is one particular scenario where set\_key() fails. And that's when OpenSSL is used in FIPS mode and PRF\_HMAC\_MD5 is negotiated. The PRF implementation can be instantiated fine, as that only retrieves a static reference to a message digest object, which works in regular and FIPS mode. However, set\_key() later fails in FIPS mode due to the call to HMAC\_Init\_ex(), which calls EVP\_DigestInit\_ex() and that fails for non-FIPS-approved algorithms like MD5.

Remote code execution is not possible due to this issue.

### Mitigation

If OpenSSL is not used in FIPS mode it should not be possible to trigger this issue. And because the called HMAC\_Init\_ex() function only has a
return value since OpenSSL 1.0, setups that link to older versions won't be directly affected either (even in FIPS mode, although the derivation won't result in valid keys).

strongSwan has removed MD5 from the default proposal with [5.6.1](/blog/2017/11/18/strongswan-5.6.1-released.html) (as PRF and IKE integrity algorithm), so recent releases are not affected in this scenario; unless the algorithm is explicitly configured in an IKE proposal (but such a configuration would not be FIPS-compliant).
For earlier versions, IKE proposals that don't include MD5 may be configured explicitly to avoid the default proposal and this issue.

Another way to mitigate the problem is to load the *test-vectors* plugin and enable *charon.crypto\_test.required* and *charon.crypto\_test.on\_add* (or *.on\_create*). Since the test vectors won't be successful for algorithms unsupported in FIPS mode, the implementations get disabled and won't be added to the default proposals. And if explicitly configured and negotiated, the key derivation would fail earlier when the PRF is instantiated and no implementation is found (or the test vectors fail, if *.on\_create* is enabled).

Finally, the just released [strongSwan 5.6.3](/blog/2018/05/28/strongswan-5.6.3-released.html) fixes this vulnerability.  For older releases we [provide patches](https://download.strongswan.org/security/CVE-2018-10811/) that fix the vulnerability in the respective versions and should apply with appropriate hunk offsets.

# CVE-2018-16151

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16140.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16152.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16151 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16151)

#### Description

In verify\_emsa\_pkcs1\_signature() in gmp\_rsa\_public\_key.c in the gmp plugin in strongSwan 4.x and 5.x before 5.7.0, the RSA implementation based on GMP does not reject excess data after the encoded algorithm OID during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Similar to the flaw in the same version of strongSwan regarding digestAlgorithm.parameters, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation when only an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
This update for strongswan fixes the following issues:
Strongswan was updated to version 5.8.2 (jsc#SLE-11370).
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2018-6459: Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1
RSASSA-PSS signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation
(bsc#1079548).
Full changelogs:
Version 5.8.2
\* Identity-based CA constraints, which enforce that the certificate
chain of the remote peer contains a CA certificate with a specific
identity, are supported via vici/swanctl.conf. This is similar to the
existing CA constraints but doesn't require that the CA certificate is
locally installed, for instance, intermediate CA certificates received
from the peers. Wildcard identity matching (e.g. ..., OU=Research,
CN=\*) could also be used for the latter but requires trust in the
intermediate CAs to only issue certificates with legitimate subject
DNs (e.g. the "Sales" CA must not issue certificates with
OU=Research). With the new constraint that's not necessary as long as
a path length basic constraint (--pathlen for pki --issue) prevents
intermediate CAs from issuing further intermediate CAs.
\* Intermediate CA certificates may now be sent in hash-and-URL encoding
by configuring a base URL for the parent CA (#3234,
swanctl/rw-hash-and-url-multi-level).
\* Implemented NIST SP-800-90A Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG)
based on AES-CTR and SHA2-HMAC modes. Currently used by the gmp and
ntru plugins.
\* Random nonces sent in an OCSP requests are now expected in the
corresponding OCSP responses.
\* The kernel-netlink plugin now ignores deprecated IPv6 addresses for
MOBIKE. Whether temporary
or permanent IPv6 addresses are included now depends on the
charon.prefer\_temporary\_addrs setting (#3192).
\* Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are configured via PF\_KEY if supported
by the kernel.
\* The PF\_KEY socket's receive buffer in the kernel-pfkey plugin is now
cleared before sending requests, as many of the messages sent by the
kernel are sent as broadcasts to all PF\_KEY sockets. This is an issue
if an external tool is used to manage SAs/policies unrelated to IPsec
(#3225).
\* The vici plugin now uses unique section names for CHILD\_SAs in
child-updown events (7c74ce9190).
\* For individually deleted CHILD\_SAs (in particular for IKEv1) the vici
child-updown event now includes more information about the CHILD\_SAs
such as traffic statistics (#3198).
\* Custom loggers are correctly re-registered if log levels are changed
via stroke loglevel (#3182).
\* Avoid lockups during startup on low entropy systems when using OpenSSL
1.1.1 (095a2c2eac).
\* Instead of failing later when setting a key, creating HMACs via
openssl plugin now fails instantly if the underlying hash algorithm
isn't supported (e.g. MD5 in FIPS-mode) so fallbacks to other plugins
work properly (#3284).
\* Exponents of RSA keys read from TPM 2.0 via SAPI are correctly
converted (8ee1242f1438).
\* Routing table IDs > 255 are supported for custom routes on Linux.
\* To avoid races, the check for hardware offloading support in the
kernel-netlink plugin is performed during initialization of the plugin
(a605452c03).
\* The D-Bus config file for charon-nm is now installed in
$(datadir)/dbus-1/system.d instead of $(sysconfdir)/dbus-1/system.d,
which is intended for sysadmin overrides. INVALID\_MAJOR\_VERSION
notifies are now correctly sent in messages of the same exchange type
and with the same message ID as the request.
\* IKEv2 SAs are now immediately destroyed when sending or receiving
INVALID\_SYNTAX notifies in authenticated messages.
\* For developers working from the repository the configure script now
aborts if GNU gperf is not found.
Version 5.8.1
\* RDNs in DNs of X.509 certificates can now optionally be matched less
strict. The global strongswan.conf option charon.rdn\_matching takes
two alternative values that cause the matching algorithm to either
ignore the order of matched RDNs (reordered) or additionally (relaxed)
accept DNs that contain more RDNs than configured (unmatched RDNs are
treated like wildcard matches).
\* The updown plugin now passes the same interface to the script that is
also used for the automatically installed routes, that is, the
interface over which the peer is reached instead of the interface on
which the local address is found (#3095).
\* TPM 2.0 contexts are now protected by a mutex to prevent issues if
multiple IKE\_SAs use the same private key concurrently (4b25885025).
\* Do a rekey check after the third QM message was received (#3060).
\* If available, explicit\_bzero() is now used as memwipe() instead of our
own implementation.
\* An .editorconfig file has been added, mainly so Github shows files
with proper indentation (68346b6962).
\* The internal certificate of the load-tester plugin has been modified
so it can again be used as end-entity cert with 5.6.3 and later
(#3139).
\* The maximum data length of received COOKIE notifies (64 bytes) is now
enforced (#3160).
Version 5.8.0
\* The systemd service units have been renamed. The modern unit, which
was called strongswan-swanctl, is now called strongswan (the previous
name is configured as alias in the unit, for which a symlink is
created when the unit is enabled). The legacy unit is now called
strongswan-starter.
\* Support for XFRM interfaces (available since Linux 4.19) has been
added, which are intended to replace VTI devices (they are similar but
offer several advantages, for instance, they are not bound to an
address or address family).
\* IPsec SAs and policies are associated with such interfaces via
interface IDs that can be configured in swanctl.conf (dynamic IDs may
optionally be allocated for each SA and even direction). It's possible
to use separate interfaces for in- and outbound traffic (or
only use an interface in one direction and regular policies in the
other).
\* Interfaces may be created dynamically via updown/vici scripts, or
statically before or after establishing the SAs. Routes must be added
manually as needed (the daemon will not install any routes for
outbound policies with an interface ID).
\* When moving XFRM interfaces to other network namespaces they retain
access to the SAs and policies installed in the original namespace,
which allows providing IPsec tunnels for processes in other network
namespaces without giving them access to the IPsec keys or IKE
credentials. More information can be found on the page about
route-based VPNs.
\* Initiation of childless IKE\_SAs is supported (RFC 6023). If enabled
and supported by the responder, no CHILD\_SA is established during
IKE\_AUTH. Instead, all CHILD\_SAs are created with CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
exchanges. This allows using a separate DH exchange even for the first
CHILD\_SA, which is otherwise created during IKE\_AUTH with keys derived
from the IKE\_SA's key material.
\* The swanctl --initiate command may be used to initiate only the IKE\_SA
via --ike
option if --child is omitted and the peer supports this extension.
\* The NetworkManager backend and plugin support IPv6.
\* The new wolfssl plugin is a wrapper around the wolfSSL crypto library.
Thanks to Sean Parkinson of wolfSSL Inc. for the initial patch.
\* IKE SPIs may optionally be labeled via the charon.spi\_mask|label
options in strongswan.conf. This feature was extracted from
charon-tkm, however, now applies the mask/label in network order.
\* The openssl plugin supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 when built with OpenSSL
1.1.0.
\* The PB-TNC finite state machine according to section 3.2 of RFC 5793
was not correctly implemented when sending either a CRETRY or SRETRY
batch. These batches can only be sent in the "Decided" state and a
CRETRY batch can immediately carry all messages usually transported by
a CDATA batch. It is currently not possible to send a SRETRY batch
since full-duplex mode for PT-TLS transport is not supported.
\* Instead of marking IPv6 virtual IPs as deprecated, the kernel-netlink
plugin now uses address labels to avoid that such addresses are used
for non-VPN traffic (00a953d090).
\* The agent plugin now creates sockets to the ssh/gpg-agent dynamically
and does not keep them open, which otherwise might prevent the agent
from getting terminated.
\* To avoid broadcast loops the forecast plugin now only reinjects
packets that are marked
or received from the configured interface.
\* UTF-8 encoded passwords are supported via EAP-MSCHAPv2, which
internally uses an UTF-16LE encoding to calculate the NT hash (#3014).
\* Properly delete temporary drop policies (used when updating IP
addresses of SAs) if manual priorities are used, which was broken
since 5.6.2 (8e31d65730).
\* Avoid overwriting start\_action when parsing the inactivity timeout in
the vici plugin (#2954).
\* Fixed the automatic termination of reloaded vici connections with
start\_action=start, which was broken since 5.6.3 (71b22c250f).
\* The lookup for shared secrets for IKEv1 SAs via sql plugin should now
work better (6ec9f68f32).
\* Fixed a race condition in the trap manager between installation and
removal of a policy (69cbe2ca3f).
\* The IPsec stack detection and module loading in starter has been
removed (it wasn't enforced anyway and loading modules doesn't seem
necessary, also KLIPS hasn't been supported for a long time and PF\_KEY
will eventually be removed from the Linux kernel, ba817d2917).
\* Several IKEv2 protocol details are now handled more strictly:
Unrequested virtual IPs are ignored, CFG\_REPLY payloads are ignored if
no CFG\_REQUEST payloads were sent, a USE TRANSPORT\_MODE notify
received from the responder is checked against the local configuration.
\* The keys and certificates used by the scenarios in the testing
environment are now generated dynamically. Running the
testing/scripts/build-certs script after creating the base and root
images uses the pki utility installed in the latter to create the keys
and certificates for all the CAs and in some cases for individual
scenarios. These credentials are stored in the source tree, not the
image, so this has to be called only once even if the images are later
rebuilt. The script automatically (re-)rebuilds the guest images as
that generates fresh CRLs and signs the DNS zones. The only
keys/certificates currently not generated are the very large ones used
by the ikev2/rw-eap-tls-fragments scenario.
Version 5.7.2
\* For RSA with PSS padding, the TPM 2.0 specification mandates the
maximum salt length (as defined by the length of the key and hash).
However, if the TPM is FIPS-168-4 compliant, the salt length equals
the hash length. This is assumed for FIPS-140-2 compliant TPMs, but if
that's not the case, it might be necessary to manually enable
charon.plugins.tpm.fips\_186\_4 if the TPM doesn't use the maximum salt
length.
\* Directories for credentials loaded by swanctl are now accessed
relative to the loaded swanctl.conf file, in particular, when loading
it from a custom location via --file argument.
\* The base directory, which is used if no custom location for
swanctl.conf is specified, is now also configurable at runtime via
SWANCTL\_DIR environment variable.
\* If RADIUS Accounting is enabled, the eap-radius plugin will add the
session ID (Acct-Session-Id) to Access-Request messages, which e.g.
simplifies associating database entries for IP leases and accounting
with sessions (the session ID does not change when IKE\_SAs are
rekeyed, #2853).
\* All IP addresses assigned by a RADIUS server are included in
Accounting-Stop messages even if the client did not claim them,
allowing to release them early in case of connection errors (#2856).
\* Selectors installed on transport mode SAs by the kernel-netlink plugin
are now updated if an IP address changes (e.g. via MOBIKE) and it was
part of the selectors.
\* No deletes are sent anymore when a rekeyed CHILD\_SA expires (#2815).
\* The bypass-lan plugin now tracks interfaces to handle subnets that
move from one interface to another and properly update associated
routes (#2820).
\* Only valid and expected inbound IKEv2 messages are used to update the
timestamp of the last received message (previously, retransmits also
triggered an update).
\* IKEv2 requests from responders are now ignored until the IKE\_SA is
fully established (e.g. if a DPD request from the peer arrives before
the IKE\_AUTH response does, 46bea1add9). Delayed IKE\_SA\_INIT responses
with COOKIE notifies we already recevied are ignored, they caused
another reset of the IKE\_SA previously (#2837).
\* Active and queued Quick Mode tasks are now adopted if the peer
reauthenticates an IKEv1 SA while creating lots of CHILD\_SAs.
\* Newer versions of the FreeBSD kernel add an SADB\_X\_EXT\_SA2 extension
to SADB\_ACQUIRE messages, which allows the kernel-pfkey plugin to
determine the reqid of the policy even if it wasn't installed by the
daemon previously (e.g. when using FreeBSD's if\_ipsec(4) VTIs, which
install policies themselves, 872b9b3e8d).
\* Added support for RSA signatures with SHA-256 and SHA-512 to the agent
plugin. For older versions of ssh/gpg-agent that only support SHA-1,
IKEv2 signature authentication has to be disabled via
charon.signature\_authentication.
\* The sshkey and agent plugins support Ed25519/Ed448 SSH keys and
signatures.
\* The openssl plugin supports X25519/X448 Diffie-Hellman and
Ed25519/Ed448 keys and signatures when built against OpenSSL 1.1.1.
\* Support for Ed25519, ChaCha20/Poly1305, SHA-3 and AES-CCM were added
to the botan plugin.
\* The mysql plugin now properly handles database connections with
transactions under heavy load (#2779).
\* IP addresses in ha pools are now distributed evenly among all segments
(#2828).
\* Private key implementations may optionally provide a list of supported
signature schemes, which, as described above, is used by the tpm
plugin because for each key on a TPM 2.0 the hash algorithm and for
RSA also the padding scheme is predefined.
\* The testing environment is now based on Debian 9 (stretch) by default.
This required some changes, in particular, updating to FreeRADIUS 3.x
(which forced us to abandon the TNC@FHH patches and scenarios,
2fbe44bef3) and removing FIPS-enabled versions of OpenSSL (the FIPS
module only supports OpenSSL 1.0.2).
\* Most test scenarios were migrated to swanctl.
Version 5.7.1
\* Fixes a vulnerability in the gmp plugin triggered by crafted
certificates with RSA keys with very small moduli. When verifying
signatures with such keys, the code patched with the fix for
CVE-2018-16151/2 caused an integer underflow and subsequent heap
buffer overflow that results in a crash of the daemon.
\* The vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-17540.
Version 5.7.0
\* Fixes a potential authorization bypass vulnerability in the gmp plugin
that was caused by a too lenient verification of PKCS#1 v1.5
signatures. Several flaws could be exploited by a Bleichenbacher-style
attack to forge signatures for low-exponent keys (i.e. with e=3).
\* CVE-2018-16151 has been assigned to the problem of accepting random
bytes after the OID
of the hash function in such signatures, and CVE-2018-16152 has been
assigned to the issue
of not verifying that the parameters in the ASN.1 algorithmIdentitifer
structure is empty. Other flaws that don't lead to a vulnerability
directly (e.g. not checking for at least 8 bytes of padding) have no
separate CVE assigned.
\* Dots are not allowed anymore in section names in swanctl.conf and
strongswan.conf. This mainly affects the configuration of file
loggers. If the path for such a log file contains dots it now has to
be configured in the new path setting within the arbitrarily renamed
subsection in the filelog section.
\* Sections in swanctl.conf and strongswan.conf may now reference other
sections. All settings and subsections from such a section are
inherited. This allows to simplify configs as redundant information
has only to be specified once and may then be included in other
sections (see strongswan.conf for an example).
\* The originally selected IKE config (based on the IPs and IKE version)
can now change if no matching algorithm proposal is found. This way
the order of the configs doesn't matter that much anymore and it's
easily possible to specify separate configs for clients that require
weaker algorithms (instead of having to also add them in other configs
that might be selected).
\* Support for Postquantum Preshared Keys for IKEv2
(draft-ietf-ipsecme-qr-ikev2) has been added. For an example refer to
the swanctl/rw-cert-ppk scenario (or with EAP, or PSK authentication).
\* The new botan plugin is a wrapper around the Botan C++ crypto library.
It requires a fairly recent build from Botan's master branch (or the
upcoming 2.8.0 release). Thanks to René Korthaus and his team from
Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity for the initial patch and to Jack Lloyd
for quickly adding missing functions to Botan's FFI (C89) interface.
\* Implementation of RFC 8412 "Software Inventory Message and Attributes
(SWIMA) for PA-TNC".
\* SWIMA subscription option sets CLOSE\_WRITE trigger on apt history.log
file resulting in a ClientRetry PB-TNC batch to initialize a new
measurement cycle. The new imv/imc-swima plugins replace the previous
imv/imc-swid plugins, which were removed.
\* Added support for fuzzing the PA-TNC (RFC 5792) and PB-TNC (RFC 5793)
NEA protocols
on Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure.
\* Support for version 2 of Intel's TPM2-TSS TGC Software Stack. The
presence of the in-kernel /dev/tpmrm0 resource manager is
automatically detected.
\* The pki tool accepts a xmppAddr otherName as a subjectAlternativeName
using the syntax --san xmppaddr:<jid>.
\* swanctl.conf supports the configuration of marks the in- and/or
outbound SA should apply to packets after processing on Linux.
Configuring such a mark for outbound SAs requires at least a 4.14
kernel. The ability to set a mask and configuring a mark/mask for
inbound SAs will be added with the upcoming 4.19 kernel.
\* New options in swanctl.conf allow configuring how/whether DF, ECN and
DS fields in the IP headers are copied during IPsec processing.
Controlling this is currently only possible
on Linux.
\* The handling of sequence numbers in IKEv1 DPDs has been improved
(#2714).
\* To avoid conflicts, the dhcp plugin now only uses the DHCP server port
if explicitly configured.
Version 5.6.3
\* Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the IKEv2 key derivation if the openssl
plugin is used in FIPS mode and HMAC-MD5 is negotiated as PRF. This
vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-10811.
\* Fixed a vulnerability in the stroke plugin, which did not check the
received length before reading a message from the socket. Unless a
group is configured, root privileges are required to access that
socket, so in the default configuration this shouldn't be an issue.
This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-5388.
\* CRLs that are not yet valid are now ignored to avoid problems in
scenarios where expired certificates are removed from new CRLs and the
clock on the host doing the revocation check is trailing behind that
of the host issuing CRLs. Not doing this could result in accepting a
revoked and expired certificate, if it's still valid according to the
trailing clock but not contained anymore in not yet valid CRLs.
\* The issuer of fetched CRLs is now compared to the issuer of the
checked certificate (#2608).
\* CRL validation results other than revocation (e.g. a skipped check
because the CRL couldn't be fetched) are now stored also for
intermediate CA certificates and not only for end-entity certificates,
so a strict CRL policy can be enforced in such cases.
\* In compliance with RFC 4945, section 5.1.3.2, certificates used for
IKE must now either not contain a keyUsage extension (like the ones
generated by pki), or have at least one of the digitalSignature or
nonRepudiation bits set.
\* New options for vici/swanctl allow forcing the local termination of an
IKE\_SA. This might be useful in situations where it's known the other
end is not reachable anymore, or that it already removed the IKE\_SA,
so retransmitting a DELETE and waiting for a response would be
pointless.
\* Waiting only a certain amount of time for a response (i.e. shorter
than all retransmits would be) before destroying the IKE\_SA is also
possible by additionally specifying a timeout in the forced
termination request.
\* When removing routes, the kernel-netlink plugin now checks if it
tracks other routes for the same destination and replaces the
installed route instead of just removing it. Same during installation,
where existing routes previously weren't replaced. This should allow
using traps with virtual IPs on Linux (#2162).
\* The dhcp plugin now only sends the client identifier DHCP option if
the identity\_lease setting is enabled (7b660944b6). It can also send
identities of up to 255 bytes length, instead of the previous 64 bytes
(30e886fe3b, 0e5b94d038). If a server address is configured, DHCP
requests are now sent from port 67 instead of 68 to avoid ICMP port
unreachables (becf027cd9).
\* The handling of faulty INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notifies (e.g. one
containing a DH group that wasn't proposed) during CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
exchanges has been improved (#2536).
\* Roam events are now completely ignored for IKEv1 SAs (there is no
MOBIKE to handle such changes properly).
\* ChaCha20/Poly1305 is now correctly proposed without key length
(#2614). For compatibility with
older releases the chacha20poly1305compat keyword may be included in
proposals to also propose the algorithm with a key length
(c58434aeff).
\* Configuration of hardware offload of IPsec SAs is now more flexible
and allows a new setting (auto), which automatically uses it if the
kernel and device both support it. If hw
offload is set to yes and offloading is not supported, the CHILD\_SA
installation now fails.
\* The kernel-pfkey plugin optionally installs routes via internal
interface (one with an IP in the local traffic selector). On FreeBSD,
enabling this selects the correct source IP when sending packets from
the gateway itself (e811659323).
\* SHA-2 based PRFs are supported in PKCS#8 files as generated by OpenSSL
1.1 (#2574).
\* The pki --verify tool may load CA certificates and CRLs from
directories.
\* The IKE daemon now also switches to port 4500 if the remote port is
not 500 (e.g. because the remote maps the response to a different
port, as might happen on Azure), as long as the local port is 500
(85bfab621d).
\* Fixed an issue with DNS servers passed to NetworkManager in charon-nm
(ee8c25516a).
\* Logged traffic selectors now always contain the protocol if either
protocol or port are set (a36d8097ed).
\* Only the inbound SA/policy will be updated as reaction to IP address
changes for rekeyed CHILD\_SAs that are kept around.
\* The parser for strongswan.conf/swanctl.conf now accepts = characters
in values without having to put the value in quotes (e.g. for Base64
encoded shared secrets).
Notes for developers:
\* trap\_manager\_t: Trap policies are now unistalled by peer/child name
and not the reqid.
\* No reqid is returned anymore when installing trap policies.
\* child\_sa\_t: A new state (CHILD\_DELETED) is used for CHILD\_SAs that
have been deleted but not yet destroyed (after a rekeying CHILD\_SAs
are kept around for a while to process delayed packets). This way
child\_updown events are not triggered anymore for such SAs when an
IKE\_SA that has such CHILD\_SAs assigned is deleted.
Version 5.6.2
\* Fixed a DoS vulnerability in the parser for PKCS#1 RSASSA-PSS
signatures that was caused by insufficient input validation. One of
the configurable parameters in algorithm identifier structures for
RSASSA-PSS signatures is the mask generation function (MGF). Only MGF1
is currently specified for this purpose. However, this in turn takes
itself a parameter that specifies the underlying hash function.
strongSwan's parser did not correctly handle the case of this
parameter being absent, causing an undefined data read. This
vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-6459.
\* When rekeying IKEv2 IKE\_SAs the previously negotiated DH group will be
reused, instead of using the first configured group, which avoids an
additional exchange if the peer previously selected a different DH
group via INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notify. The same is also done when
rekeying CHILD\_SAs except for the first rekeying of the CHILD\_SA that
was created with the IKE\_SA, where no DH group was negotiated yet.
Also, the selected DH group is moved to the front in all sent
proposals that contain it and all proposals that don't are moved to
the back in order to convey the preference for this group to the peer.
\* Handling of MOBIKE task queuing has been improved. In particular, the
response to an address update (with NAT-D payloads) is not ignored
anymore if only an address list update
or DPD is queued as that could prevent updating the UDP encapsulation
in the kernel.
\* On Linux, roam events may optionally be triggered by changes to the
routing rules, which can be useful if routing rules (instead of e.g.
route metrics) are used to switch from one to another interface (i.e.
from one to another routing table). Since routing rules are currently
not evaluated when doing route lookups this is only useful if the
kernel-based route lookup is used (4664992f7d).
\* The fallback drop policies installed to avoid traffic leaks when
replacing addresses in installed policies are now replaced by
temporary drop policies, which also prevent acquires because we
currently delete and reinstall IPsec SAs to update their addresses
(35ef1b032d).
\* Access X.509 certificates held in non-volatile storage of a TPM 2.0
referenced via the NV index. Adding the --keyid parameter to pki
--print allows to print private keys or certificates stored in a
smartcard or a TPM 2.0.
\* Fixed proposal selection if a peer incorrectly sends DH groups in the
ESP proposal during IKE\_AUTH and also if a DH group is configured in
the local ESP proposal and charon.prefer configured\_proposals is
disabled (d058fd3c32).
\* The lookup for PSK secrets for IKEv1 has been improved for certain
scenarios (see #2497 for details).
\* MSKs received via RADIUS are now padded to 64 bytes to avoid
compatibility issues with EAP-MSCHAPv2 and PRFs that have a block size
< 64 bytes (e.g. AES-XCBC-PRF-128, see 73cbce6013).
\* The tpm\_extendpcr command line tool extends a digest into a TPM PCR.
\* Ported the NetworkManager backend from the deprecated libnm-glib to
libnm.
\* The save-keys debugging/development plugin saves IKE and/or ESP keys
to files compatible with Wireshark.
Version 5.6.1
\* Several algorithms were removed from the default ESP/AH and IKE
proposals in compliance with RFC 8221 and RFC 8247, respectively.
Removed from the default ESP/AH proposal were the 3DES and Blowfish
encryption algorithms and the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm. From the
IKE default proposal the HMAC-MD5 integrity algorithm and the
MODP-1024 Diffie-Hellman group were removed (the latter is significant
for Windows clients in their default configuration). These algorithms
may still be used in custom proposals.
\* Support for RSASSA-PSS signatures has been added. For compatibility
with previous releases they are currently not used automatically, by
default, to change that charon.rsa\_pss may be enabled. To explicitly
use or require such signatures during IKEv2 signature authentication
(RFC 7427) ike:rsa/pss... authentication constraints may be used for
specific connections (regardless of whether the strongswan.conf option
above is enabled). Only the hash algorithm can be specified in such
constraints, the MGF1 will be based on that hash and the salt length
will equal the hash length (when verifying the salt length is not
enforced). To enforce such signatures during PKI verification use
rsa/pss... authentication constraints.
\* All pki commands that create certificates/CRLs can be made to sign
with RSASSA-PSS instead
of the classing PKCS#1 scheme with the --rsa-padding pss option. As
with signatures during authentication, only the hash algorithm is
configurable (via --digest option), the MGF1 will be based on that
and the salt length will equal the hash length.
\* These signatures are supported by all RSA backends except pkcs11 (i.e.
gmp, gcrypt, openssl). The gmp plugin requires the mgf1 plugin. Note
that RSASSA-PSS algorithm identifiers and parameters in keys (public
keys in certificates or private keys in PKCS#8 files) are currently
not used as constraints.
\* The sec-updater tool checks for security updates in dpkg-based
repositories (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu) and sets the security flags in the
IMV policy database accordingly. Additionally for each new package
version a SWID tag for the given OS and HW architecture is created and
stored in the database.
\* Using the sec-updater.sh script template the lookup can be automated
(e.g. via an hourly cron job).
\* When restarting an IKEv2 negotiation after receiving an
INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notify (or due to other reasons like too many
retransmits) a new initiator SPI is allocated. This prevents issues
caused by retransmits for IKE\_SA\_INIT messages.
\* Because the initiator SPI was previously reused when restarting the
connection delayed responses for previous connection attempts were
processed and might have caused fatal errors due to a failed DH
negotiation or because of the internal retry counter in the ike-init
task. For instance, if we proposed a DH group the responder rejected
we might have later received delayed responses that either contained
INVALID\_KE\_PAYLOAD notifies with the DH group we already switched to,
or, if we retransmitted an IKE\_SA\_INIT with the requested group but
then had to restart again, a KE payload with a group different from
the one we proposed.
\* The introduction of file versions in the IMV database scheme broke
file reference hash measurements. This has been fixed by creating
generic product versions having an empty package name.
\* A new timeout option for the systime-fix plugin stops periodic system
time checks after a while and enforces a certificate verification,
closing or reauthenticating all SAs with invalid certificates.
\* The IKE event counters, previously only available via ipsec
listcounters command, may now also be queried and reset via vici and
the new swanctl --counters command. They are collected and provided by
the optional counters plugin (enabled by default for backwards
compatibility if the stroke plugin is built).
\* Class attributes received in RADIUS Access-Accept messages may
optionally be added to RADIUS accounting messages (655924074b).
\* Basic support for systemd sockets has been added, which may be used
for privilege separation (59db98fb94).
\* Inbound marks may optionally be installed in the SA again (was removed
with 5.5.2) by enabling the mark\_in\_sa option in swanctl.conf.
\* The timeout of leases in pools configured via pool utility may be
configured in other units than hours. INITIAL\_CONTACT notifies are now
only omitted if never is configured as uniqueness policy.
\* Outbound FWD policies for shunts are not installed anymore, by default
(as is the case for other policies since 5.5.1).
\* Don't consider a DH group mismatch during CHILD\_SA rekeying as failure
as responder (e7276f78aa).
\* Handling of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets in libipsec has been
improved (e138003de9).
\* Trigger expire events for the correct IPsec SA in libipsec
(6e861947a0).
\* A crash in CRL verification via openssl plugin using OpenSSL 1.1 has
been fixed (78acaba6a1).
\* No hard-coded default proposals are passed from starter to the stroke
plugin anymore (the IKE proposal used curve25519 since 5.5.2, which is
an optional plugin).
\* A workaround for an issue with virtual IPs on macOS 10.13 (High
Sierra) has been added (039b85dd43).
\* Handling of IKE\_SA rekey collisions in charon-tkm has been fixed.
\* Instead of failing or just silently doing nothing unit tests may now
warn about certain conditions (e.g. if a test was not executed due to
external dependencies).

Package        : strongswan
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5388 CVE-2018-10811

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.

CVE-2018-5388

    The stroke plugin did not verify the message length when reading from its
    control socket. This vulnerability could lead to denial of service. On
    Debian write access to the socket requires root permission on default
    configuration.

CVE-2018-10811

    A missing variable initialization in IKEv2 key derivation could lead to a
    denial of service (crash of the charon IKE daemon) if the openssl plugin is
    used in FIPS mode and the negotiated PRF is HMAC-MD5.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.1-6+deb8u6.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.

For the detailed security status of strongswan please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/strongswan>

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
