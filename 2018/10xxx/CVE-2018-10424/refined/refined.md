Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the GitHub issue:

**Vulnerability 1: Web Root File Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, MiniCMS, improperly handles file paths during the process of posting and displaying an article, causing the server's web root files to be visible in the HTML of the page. Specifically, the application does not adequately sanitize the path when an article is created, leading to inclusion of server file paths.
*   **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure through improper handling of server file paths in the response.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the file structure and content of the webserver's root directory. This information can then be used for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to log into the administrative panel of MiniCMS, create a post, and examine the page source to find the disclosed file path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to log into the MiniCMS administrative interface.

**Vulnerability 2: Real Path Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's file handling mechanism when editing a post reveals the server's file system path. Specifically, when editing a post (which is stored with a `.dat` extension like `iabl13.dat`), manipulating the request parameters to a non-existent file (e.g. `hello-iabl13`) results in an error message that reveals the full path of the MiniCMS files on the server.
*  **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure via error messages that expose the full file system path. The application does not handle non-existent file requests securely, revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the absolute file path of the MiniCMS installation on the server, potentially making the system more vulnerable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to log into the administrative panel of MiniCMS, edit a previously created post, intercept the request with Burp Suite or a similar tool, manipulate the file identifier, and examine the error response.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to log into the MiniCMS administrative interface.

**Summary**

Both vulnerabilities are information disclosure issues that stem from improper handling of file paths within the MiniCMS application. They require an authenticated user with administrator privileges to exploit. The vulnerabilities allows an attacker to learn the full path of web root files, and full paths of the application.
