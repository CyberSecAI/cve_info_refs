# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2608)

## Topic

Updated glusterfs packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and adds various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

GlusterFS is a key building block of Red Hat Gluster Storage. It is based on a stackable user-space design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnections into one large, parallel network file system.

Security Fix(es):

* glusterfs: Unsanitized file names in debug/io-stats translator can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10904)
* glusterfs: Stack-based buffer overflow in server-rpc-fops.c allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10907)
* glusterfs: I/O to arbitrary devices on storage server (CVE-2018-10923)
* glusterfs: Device files can be created in arbitrary locations (CVE-2018-10926)
* glusterfs: File status information leak and denial of service (CVE-2018-10927)
* glusterfs: Improper resolution of symlinks allows for privilege escalation (CVE-2018-10928)
* glusterfs: Arbitrary file creation on storage server allows for execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2018-10929)
* glusterfs: Files can be renamed outside volume (CVE-2018-10930)
* glusterfs: Improper deserialization in dict.c:dict\_unserialize() can allow attackers to read arbitrary memory (CVE-2018-10911)
* glusterfs: remote denial of service of gluster volumes via posix\_get\_file\_contents function in posix-helpers.c (CVE-2018-10914)
* glusterfs: Information Exposure in posix\_get\_file\_contents function in posix-helpers.c (CVE-2018-10913)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting these issues.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1105776#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2018-09-04 09:36:25 UTC  ``` public now via oss-sec:  From: Siddharth Sharma <siddharth@redhat.com> Subject: [oss-security] glusterfs: multiple flaws Date: Tue, 4 Sep 2018 04:31:11 -0400 (EDT)  Hello,  We were informed about several security flaws affecting glusterfs. All of the following bugs were reported by Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch).  CVE count: 12   CVE-2018-10904 ==============  It was found that glusterfs server does not properly sanitize file paths in the  "trusted.io-stats-dump" extended attribute which is used by the  "debug/io-stats" translator. An attacker can use this flaw to create files and  execute arbitrary code. To exploit this, the attacker would require sufficient  access to modify the extended attributes of files on a gluster volume.   CVE-2018-10907 ==============  It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to mulitple stack based buffer  overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed size buffers  using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit this by mounting a  gluster volume and sending a string longer that the fixed buffer size to cause  crash or potential code execution.   CVE-2018-10911 ==============  A flaw was found in dict.c:dict_unserialize function of glusterfs,  dic_unserialize function does not handle negative key length values. An attacker  could use this flaw to read memory from other locations into the stored dict  value.   CVE-2018-10913 ============== An information disclosure vulnerability was discovered in glusterfs server. An  attacker could issue a xattr request via glusterfs FUSE to determine the  existence of any file.   CVE-2018-10914 ==============  It was found that an attacker could issue a xattr request via glusterfs FUSE to  cause gluster brick process to crash which will result in a remote denial of  service. If gluster multiplexing is enabled this will result in a crash of  multiple bricks and gluster volumes.   CVE-2018-10923 ==============  It was found that the "mknod" call derived from mknod(2) can create files  pointing to devices on a glusterfs server node. An authenticated attacker could  use this to create an arbitrary device and read data from any device attached  to the glusterfs server node.   CVE-2018-10924 ==============  It was discovered that fsync(2) system call in glusterfs client code leaks  memory. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to launch a denial of  service attack by making gluster clients consume memory of the host machine.   CVE-2018-10926 ==============  A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_mknod_req supported by glusterfs  server. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to write files to an  arbitrary location via path traversal and execute arbitrary code on a glusterfs  server node.   CVE-2018-10927 ==============  A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_lookup_req in glusterfs server. An  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to leak information and execute  remote denial of service by crashing gluster brick process.   CVE-2018-10928 ==============  A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_symlink_req in glusterfs server  which allows symlink destinations to point to file paths outside of the gluster  volume. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary  symlinks pointing anywhere on the server and execute arbitrary code on  glusterfs server nodes.   CVE-2018-10929 ==============  A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs2_create_req in glusterfs server. An  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary files and  execute arbitrary code on glusterfs server nodes.   CVE-2018-10930 ==============  A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_rename_req in glusterfs server. An  authenticated attacker could use this flaw to write to a destination outside  the gluster volume.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:00:56 UTC  ``` The Gluster filesystem allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on the storage server via mounted gluster volumes. An attacker could subsequently exploit this to execute arbitrary privileged commands.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:01:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c5)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-16 01:54:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.  This flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network. For Red Hat Virtualization, Product Security has rated this flaw as Moderate. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c7)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-04 05:39:18 UTC  ``` Created glusterfs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1625069](show_bug.cgi?id=1625069 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10929 glusterfs: Arbitrary file creation on storage server allows for execution of arbitrary code [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-04 06:25:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 7   Native Client for RHEL 7 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:2607 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2607](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2607)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-04 06:26:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 6   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:2608 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2608](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2608)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c11)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-04 14:56:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To limit exposure of gluster server nodes :    1. gluster server should be on LAN and not reachable from public networks.   2. Use gluster auth.allow and auth.reject.   3. Use TLS certificates to authenticate gluster clients.  caveat: This does not protect from attacks by authenticated gluster clients.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c12)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-09-05 07:46:49 UTC  ``` upstream fix  <https://review.gluster.org/21068>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 14:57:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3470 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3470](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3470)   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 909215

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in GlusterFS, a
clustered file system. Buffer overflows and path traversal issues may
lead to information disclosure, denial-of-service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

To resolve the security vulnerabilities the following limitations were
made in GlusterFS:

    - open,read,write on special files like char and block are no longer
      permitted
    - io-stat xlator can dump stat info only to /run/gluster directory

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.2-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your glusterfs packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1090084#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2018-04-18 15:07:22 UTC  ``` rh#1558721  As reported:  When certain options are enabled in Gluster, it creates a volume called gluster_shared_storage. This volume is mounted on each server in the cluster and used to share state. The volume is not intended to be mounted by storage clients as it does not contain any data that is intended to be user accessi= ble.   When snapshot scheduling is enabled in Gluster, this gluster_shared_storage volume is used to coordinate the snapshots. Part of that is sharing the cron job that is used to trigger scheduled snaps. The crontab file exposed in the shared volume is symlinked into each server's /etc/cron.d directory.   By default, the shared_storage volume can be mounted by any client that has access to the cluster to mount data volumes. Further, since Gluster relies = on client-reported uids, the shared_storage volume can be written from any of these clients, permitting cron entries to be added to the system crontab directory such that they will be executed by each server as root (or any ot= her uid).

This vulnerability affects gluster servers that use 'auth.allow' to restrict access to gluster volumes. Gluster servers using TLS to authenticate gluster clients are not affected by this.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1612664#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:09:54 UTC  ``` The Gluster filesystem during a file rename only validates that the source path exists within the mounted volume. This can allow an attacker to rename files in locations outside a mounted volume.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1612664#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:10:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1612664#c5)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-16 01:54:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.  This flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network. For Red Hat Virtualization, Product Security has rated this flaw as Moderate.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:00:56 UTC  ``` The Gluster filesystem allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on the storage server via mounted gluster volumes. An attacker could subsequently exploit this to execute arbitrary privileged commands.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-06 06:01:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1612660#c5)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-16 01:54:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.  This flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network. For Red Hat Virtualization, Product Security has rated this flaw as Moderate.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3470)

## Topic

An update for imgbased, redhat-release-virtualization-host, and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.

Security Fix(es):

* spice: Missing check in demarshal.py:write\_validate\_array\_item() allows for buffer overflow and denial of service (CVE-2018-10873)
* glusterfs: Multiple flaws (CVE-2018-10904, CVE-2018-10907, CVE-2018-10923, CVE-2018-10926, CVE-2018-10927, CVE-2018-10928, CVE-2018-10929, CVE-2018-10930, CVE-2018-10911, CVE-2018-10914, CVE-2018-14652, CVE-2018-14653, CVE-2018-14654, CVE-2018-14659, CVE-2018-14660, CVE-2018-14661, CVE-2018-10913)
* samba: Insufficient input validation in libsmbclient (CVE-2018-10858)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting CVE-2018-10904, CVE-2018-10907, CVE-2018-10923, CVE-2018-10926, CVE-2018-10927, CVE-2018-10928, CVE-2018-10929, CVE-2018-10930, CVE-2018-10911, CVE-2018-10914, CVE-2018-14652, CVE-2018-14653, CVE-2018-14654, CVE-2018-14659, CVE-2018-14660, CVE-2018-14661, and CVE-2018-10913. The CVE-2018-10873 issue was discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* When upgrading Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH), imgbased fails to run garbage collection on previous layers, so new logical volumes are removed, and the boot entry points to a logical volume that was removed.

If the RHVH upgrade finishes successfully, the hypervisor boots successfully, even if garbage collection fails. (BZ#1632058)

* During the upgrade process, when lvremove runs garbage collection, it prompts for user confirmation, causing the upgrade process to fail. Now the process uses "lvremove --force" when trying to remove logical volumes and does not fail even if garbage collection fails, and as a result, the upgrade process finishes successfully. (BZ#1632585)
