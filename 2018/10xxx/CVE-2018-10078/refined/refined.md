```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application stores server configuration data in XML files, and allows user-controlled input to be included in these files, leading to stored XSS.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the application when a user browses certain sections of the application. This can lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities. The XSS payload persists across reboots.
- Attack vectors:
    - An attacker can add a malicious script to the server description field through the application interface.
    - An attacker can directly modify the `servers.xml` file with a crafted payload.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Requires authenticated access to the application as admin, or
    - Requires local access to the system to modify files.
