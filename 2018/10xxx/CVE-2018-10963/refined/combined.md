# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# USN-3864-1: LibTIFF vulnerabilities

22 January 2019

LibTIFF could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

## Details

It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially

crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

Package        : tiff
Version        : 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-11613 CVE-2018-5784 CVE-2018-7456
                 CVE-2018-8905 CVE-2018-10963
Debian Bug     : 869823 898348 890441 891288 893806

Several issues were discovered in TIFF, the Tag Image File Format
library, that allowed remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service or
other unspecified impact via a crafted image file.

CVE-2017-11613: DoS vulnerability
    A crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack. During the
    TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of
    td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the
    ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc
    function is called based on td_imagelength. If the value of
    td_imagelength is set close to the amount of system memory, it will
    hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.

CVE-2018-10963: DoS vulnerability
    The TIFFWriteDirectorySec() function in tif_dirwrite.c in LibTIFF
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion
    failure and application crash) via a crafted file, a different
    vulnerability than CVE-2017-13726.

CVE-2018-5784: DoS vulnerability
    In LibTIFF, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the
    TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could
    leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a
    crafted tif file.
    This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not
    validated against the actual number of directory entries.

CVE-2018-7456: NULL Pointer Dereference
    A NULL Pointer Dereference occurs in the function TIFFPrintDirectory
    in tif_print.c in LibTIFF when using the tiffinfo tool to print
    crafted TIFF information, a different vulnerability than
    CVE-2017-18013. (This affects an earlier part of the
    TIFFPrintDirectory function that was not addressed by the
    CVE-2017-18013 patch.)

CVE-2018-8905: Heap-based buffer overflow
    In LibTIFF, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the function
    LZWDecodeCompat in tif_lzw.c via a crafted TIFF file, as
    demonstrated by tiff2ps.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.0.3-12.3+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-06-27 07:48:55 UTC  ```  Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function in tiffcp.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file.  Upstream issue:  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2798>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-06-27 07:49:30 UTC  ``` Created libtiff tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1595576](show_bug.cgi?id=1595576 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-12900 libtiff: Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function resulting in a denial of service or possibly code execution [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-libtiff tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1595578](show_bug.cgi?id=1595578 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-12900 mingw-libtiff: libtiff: Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function resulting in a denial of service or possibly code execution [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1595577](show_bug.cgi?id=1595577 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-12900 mingw-libtiff: libtiff: Heap-based buffer overflow in the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function resulting in a denial of service or possibly code execution [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-07-12 08:22:46 UTC  ``` Raised CVSSv3 to 5.3/CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L because I do not exclude something more than a simple crash is possible with this flaw. Indeed you can overwrite many bytes after the limits of an heap-allocated buffer, thus code execution through heap manipulation is not excluded.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-07-12 08:42:43 UTC  ``` The flaw is in the tiffcp binary and not in the libtiff library, thus programs that use libtiff are not affected.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-07-12 08:51:39 UTC  ``` Patch is not available upstream yet.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:08:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2053 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2053](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2053)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1595575#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 19:19:16 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
