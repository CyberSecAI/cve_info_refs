Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10885:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A malicious network policy configuration within OpenShift using the `ovs-networkpolicy` plugin can cause the OpenShift Routing service to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The `ovs-networkpolicy` plugin has a vulnerability related to how it handles network policies.
-  A specially crafted network policy can trigger a crash in the OpenShift Routing component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
-  The crash of OpenShift Routing causes disruption in network connectivity and access to services within the OpenShift cluster.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Malicious actor creating and deploying a specially crafted network policy.
- The attack vector is through network policy creation/modification.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify network policies within the OpenShift cluster. This typically implies some level of authenticated access within the cluster, possibly as a user with administrative privileges or with permission to manage network policies within a namespace.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenShift 3.7 and 3.9 clusters.
- The `ovs-networkpolicy` plugin was a tech preview feature until OpenShift 3.7
- The vulnerability is fixed in OpenShift 3.10.9.
- Mitigation includes using alternative plugins like `ovs-subnet` or `ovs-multitentant`.
