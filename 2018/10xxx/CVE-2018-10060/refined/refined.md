## Analysis of CVE-2018-10060

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2018-10060. The Debian LTS advisory specifically mentions:

> CVE-2018-10060
> Cacti has XSS because it does not properly reject unintended characters, related to use of the sanitize\_uri function in lib/functions.php.

Additionally, a Github issue report details specific path-based XSS vulnerabilities, one of which is caused by injecting the payload as part of the path component, aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically within the `sanitize_uri` function in `lib/functions.php`. This function appears to fail in rejecting or encoding characters that are interpreted as HTML or JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a lack of sufficient input sanitization, specifically HTML encoding. The application echoes user-supplied data in HTML responses without properly encoding it, enabling an attacker to insert malicious code.  This is path-based XSS, where the malicious input is part of the URL path rather than a parameter value.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Compromise:** XSS attacks target users of the web application, not the application itself.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal user's credentials and other sensitive information.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive data can be compromised.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** XSS enables attackers to execute dynamic code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to complete compromise.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted URL that includes an XSS payload in the path component, not as part of a query string parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to convince a victim to visit the malicious URL.
*   No specific privileges are required on the Cacti system itself to exploit this particular XSS vulnerability, simply to craft and circulate the malicious link.
*   Successful exploitation will result in an attacker controlling the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable site.

**Additional Details beyond CVE description:**

*   The Github issue provides specific examples of URLs that trigger the XSS:
    *   `<https://cacti-mfg.Corp.com/cacti/graph_view.php/z--%3E%3Cqss%3E>`
    *   `<https://cacti-mfg.Corp.com/cacti/plugins/monitor/monitor.php/%27%20onmouseover%3D%27alert%289%29%3B%27>`
*   The issue report also provides details about authentication requirements, stating that authentication is required to reach the vulnerable URLs.
*   The provided solutions suggest that all data collected from the client should be HTML encoded.
