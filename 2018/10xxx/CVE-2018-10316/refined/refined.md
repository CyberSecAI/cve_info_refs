    "root_cause": "The `assemble_file` function in `asm/nasm.c` contains an endless while loop due to a failure condition that should return NULL, but never does because of the `nasm_malloc` implementation, which always returns a valid pointer. Additionally, an integer overflow occurs in the `globallineno` variable because of excessive repetition using `%rep` directives.",
