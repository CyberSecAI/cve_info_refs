The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Arris Touchstone Telephony Gateway devices, including CVE-2018-10989.

**CVE-2018-10989**

*   **Root Cause:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
*   **Vulnerability:** When logging into the Arris Touchstone Gateway web administration console, or when attempting to change login credentials, the credentials are exchanged over HTTP as a base64-encoded GET parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can sniff the credentials being transmitted, gaining access to the device. This allows the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the device, such as changing Wi-Fi passwords, restarting the gateway, or resetting it to factory settings.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to be in a position to sniff network traffic, either through a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack or by being present on the same network (e.g., Wi-Fi) as the administrator.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to monitor network traffic between the administrator's device and the Arris Gateway.

**Technical Details:**

The article includes examples of the vulnerable HTTP requests:

1.  **Login Request:** `http://192.168.0.1/login?arg=YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=&_n=03779&_=1526220368681`
    *   `YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=` is the base64 encoded string of `admin:password`.

2.  **Change Password Request:** `http://192.168.0.1/setPassword?arg=MTpvbGRwYXNzd29yZDpuZXdwYXNzd29yZA==&_n=66301&_=1526220788969`
    *  `MTpvbGRwYXNzd29yZDpuZXdwYXNzd29yZA==` is the base64 encoded string of `1:oldpassword:newpassword`.

3.  **Set Username Request (no base64 encoding):**
     `http://192.168.0.1/snmpSet?oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.4115.1.20.1.1.5.16.1.2.1=newUsername;4;&_n=22389&_=1526221008514`
     *   The username is transmitted directly in cleartext.

The article also notes that the `_n` parameter appears to be a session-specific identifier and the `_` parameter is a Unix timestamp in milliseconds, which does not affect the vulnerability.

The article recommends disabling web and SSH access to the gateway from the public internet and accessing the admin console only over HTTPS on an internal network and only when the network is not shared. It also suggests upgrading to a non-vulnerable firmware such as DD-WRT, when possible.
