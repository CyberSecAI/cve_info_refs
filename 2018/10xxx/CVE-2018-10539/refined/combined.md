# USN-3637-1: WavPack vulnerabilities

30 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in WavPackXXX-APP-XXX.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [wavpack](/security/cves?package=wavpack) - audio codec (lossy and lossless) - encoder and decoder

## Details

Thuan Pham, Marcel Böhme, Andrew Santosa and Alexandru Razvan Caciulescu

discovered that WavPack incorrectly handled certain .wav files. An

attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code or cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10536](/security/CVE-2018-10536), [CVE-2018-10537](/security/CVE-2018-10537))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [wavpack](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/wavpack)
  -
  [5.1.0-2ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/wavpack/5.1.0-2ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [wavpack](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/wavpack)
  -
  [5.1.0-2ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/wavpack/5.1.0-2ubuntu0.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Dear all,

This bug was found with AFLSmart, an extension of AFL. Thanks also to Marcel Böhme, Andrew Santosa and Alexandru Razvan Caciulescu. This could lead to denial of service and potentially code execution.

This bug was found on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit & WavPack revision 0a7295 (HEAD)

To reproduce:

Download & extract the attached file - wavpack\_crash5.wav

wavpack -y wavpack\_crash5.wav

Error message:

```

Package        : wavpack
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10536 CVE-2018-10537 CVE-2018-10538 CVE-2018-10539
                 CVE-2018-10540

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the wavpack audio codec which
could result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed media files are processed.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your wavpack packages.
