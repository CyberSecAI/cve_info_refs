Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure firmware update process in Diqee360 devices. The device's firmware, upon booting, automatically searches for update scripts on the microSD card.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Update Process:** The firmware update process executes code from the microSD card without verifying its digital signature, granting root privileges to the executed code.
*   **Lack of Signature Verification:** The device does not check if the update script is signed, meaning any arbitrary script could be executed by the firmware update process.
*   **Automatic Execution:** The update process starts automatically at boot, presenting an easy target for malicious manipulation.
*   **Path Traversal**: The device searches for update scripts at `/mnt/sdcard/$PRO_NAME/upgrade.sh` or `/sdcard/upgrage_360/upgrade.sh`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected devices.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Due to the root access, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire device, install backdoors, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, requiring physical access to the device to insert the malicious microSD card.
*   **MicroSD Card:** The malicious code is delivered via a specially crafted microSD card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the Diqee360 device.
*   **Ability to create microSD card:** The attacker needs the ability to create a microSD card containing malicious code.
*   **Understanding of the vulnerable pathnames:**  `/mnt/sdcard/$PRO_NAME/upgrade.sh` or `/sdcard/upgrage_360/upgrade.sh` needs to be known or discovered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content from the `gist.github.com` includes more detailed information than the CVE description, including specific directory locations for the malicious scripts.
*   The code snippet shows how the device searches for the update scripts, attempts to change permissions on a directory, and executes the found script:

    ```
    if [ -d "/mnt/sdcard/$PRO_NAME" ]; then echo "/mnt/sdcard/$PRO_NAME
    is exist..."
    cd /mnt/sdcard
    chmod 777 /mnt/nand1-2/$PRO_NAME/ -R
    /mnt/sdcard/$PRO_NAME/upgrade.sh fi
    ```
