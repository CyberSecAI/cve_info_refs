Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `git-annex` processes URLs, specifically `file:///` URLs and URLs pointing to private/local IP addresses, and also how it interacts with external special remotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Private Data Exposure and Exfiltration:** `git-annex` could be tricked into accessing and storing the content of files located outside the git-annex repository. This includes files on the local file system (using `file:///` URLs) and content from private web servers on localhost or the LAN.
2.  **Unrestricted URL Following:** The software was not restricting the types of URLs it would follow and fetch content from.
3.  **HTTP Redirect Vulnerability:**  External special remotes that use HTTP/HTTPS could also be attacked if the attacker controlled the server. By redirecting to a victim's private web server, attackers could verify if a file with known content exists on the server.
4.  **Lack of Hash Verification on Download:** Git-annex failed to verify the hash of content downloaded from special remotes leading to private data exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's machine, including configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) and other potentially confidential files.
*   **Access to Private Web Content:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate content from private web servers that the victim can access on the local network.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Git Repository:** An attacker provides a public git-annex repository that the victim clones.
2.  **Compromised Remote:** An attacker could have read access to a victim's repository, or one the victim pushes to, with some channel to get commits into it (e.g., pull requests)
3.  **Malicious URL Injection:** The attacker injects a crafted URL (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd` or a URL redirecting to a private web server) into the victim's git-annex repository via `git annex addurl --relaxed`.
4.  **Special Remote Manipulation:** In case of external special remotes, an attacker can control a server hosting the remote,  causing it to redirect to the victim's server and potentially expose data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over a Git Remote:** The attacker needs control over at least one remote of the victim's git-annex repository. This could be a public repository they provide, or access to the victim's repository, or one it pushes to.
*   **Ability to Inject Commits:** The attacker needs to be able to add malicious commits containing crafted URLs to the victim's repository.
*   **Control over a special remote server:** In some scenarios, control over the special remote server the victim connects to, is required for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is most likely to be exploited when the victim is running `git-annex assistant` or periodically running `git annex sync --content`.
*   The fix involved preventing git-annex from following `file:///` URLs and URLs pointing to private/local IP addresses by default.
*   New configuration settings (`annex.security.allowed-url-schemes` and `annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses`) allow relaxation of these restrictions.
*   Git-annex was fixed to check the hash of content from special remotes, which prevents an attacker from substituting a different file.
