The provided content describes a vulnerability in CosmoCMS, specifically related to the `install.php` and `autoload.php` files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code by accessing the `autoload.php` file after interacting with `install.php`. This suggests that the installation process might not be properly sanitizing or restricting access to certain core files after installation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code via accessing `autoload.php`, effectively providing a "getshell" vulnerability (ability to execute commands on the server).
*   **Insecure Installation Process:** The vulnerability points to a flaw in how the `install.php` script configures the system or its post-installation cleanup. The fact that `autoload.php` can be accessed and execute code after an installation process implies a misconfiguration or a lack of security measures during or after install.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain complete control of the server by executing arbitrary commands through this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves direct access to the vulnerable files, likely via a web browser. Specifically:
1.  Accessing `install.php` (though not explicitly stated what action is performed)
2. Accessing `autoload.php` directly which triggers the execution of arbitrary php code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the server where the vulnerable CosmoCMS instance is hosted. No specific user privileges or complex attacker positioning seem to be required.
