{
  "CVE-2018-10879": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in the `ext4_xattr_set_entry` function within the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. When renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image, a dangling pointer may be accessed in the loop that iterates through extended attribute entries.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
        "Improper handling of xattr blocks"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (system crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can cause the vulnerability by mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image and then renaming a file within the mounted filesystem.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to mount a file system image. Although unprivileged users cannot directly mount file systems even within user namespaces, it is possible to trick a privileged user into mounting a malicious filesystem image, such as an image on a USB drive that is automatically mounted."
