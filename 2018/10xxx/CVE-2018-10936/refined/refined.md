Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the PostgreSQL JDBC driver not performing host name validation by default when an SSL Factory is provided, and no host name verifier is provided. This means that it is possible for the driver to accept a certificate from a different host as long as the certificate was signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the improper validation of SSL/TLS certificates. Specifically, the driver doesn't verify if the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname of the server it's connecting to when using a non-default SSL factory without a host name verifier.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Exposure:** The lack of host name verification makes the system vulnerable to MITM attacks. An attacker can intercept communication and present a valid certificate for a different host signed by a trusted CA, effectively impersonating the legitimate server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Exposure:** By successfully executing a MITM attack, an attacker can intercept and potentially modify data transmitted between the Java application and the PostgreSQL server. This could lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or injection of malicious data.
*   **Impersonation of Trusted Server:** An attacker can effectively masquerade as a trusted server, fooling the client application into thinking it is communicating with the legitimate database server.
*   **Compromised Application Security:** The vulnerability compromises the security of the application relying on the PostgreSQL database. Attackers can exploit it to gain access to sensitive data or manipulate the application's behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker must position themselves between the client application and the PostgreSQL server to intercept network traffic.
*   **Network-level Access:** The attacker needs to have network-level access to intercept the communication.
*   **Trusted CA:** The attacker must possess a valid certificate for a different hostname signed by a trusted certificate authority for the vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server. This often means they're on the same network or have compromised a router or other network device.
*   **Certificate:**  The attacker needs to have a certificate signed by a trusted CA for a different hostname than the intended target server.
*   **Knowledge of target configuration:** The attacker needs to know if the client is using a custom SSL factory without a host name verifier.
*   **Knowledge of the target's connection:** The attacker needs to know the host name of the target database server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the usage of the `sslfactory` parameter in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. If this parameter is not provided, the default `LibPQFactory` is used, which is not vulnerable.
*   The fix for this issue is included in PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.2.5, which enforces hostname verification by default when using `ssl=true`. This is a change from earlier versions where `ssl=true` did not perform host verification. The driver now also supports `allow` and `prefer` options for SSL configuration.

**Summary of Changes in 42.2.5:**

*   `ssl=true` is now equivalent to `verify-full`, which enforces hostname verification.
*   Support for `allow` and `prefer` SSL modes added.
* Improved documentation and API to avoid the mistake of creating a non-validating SSL connection
