# PostgreSQL JDBC 42.2.5 Released (Security Fix CVE-2018-10936)

Posted on **2018-08-27** by JDBC Project
 Related Open Source
 Security

A potential security issue ([CVE-2018-10936](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-10936)) has been addressed. It was theoretically possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver.
During the process of investigating this a number of changes have been made.

`ssl=true` now means `verify-full`. This is a diversion from libpq which defaults to no validation or verification. With `ssl=true` or `verify-full` the driver will verify the ssl certificate and validate that the host is the host named in the certificate.

The driver now also supports allow and prefer, see https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-client.html for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-08-24 19:35:23 UTC  ``` # The Postgres JDBC driver does not perform hostname validation by default ## Vulnerability  * Product : PostgreSQL * Component : client / JDBC Driver (Tested version: org.postgresql:postgresql:jar:42.2.4) * Common Weakness : 297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch)  The PostgreSQL JDBC driver (org.postgresql:postgresql) does not perform hostname validation by default.  => This means that SSL certificates of other hosts are blindly accepted as long as they are trusted.  To exploit this vulnerability an attacker has to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between a Java application using the JDBC driver and the PostgreSQL server it's connecting to.  => TLS normally protects users and systems against MITM attacks, it cannot if certificates from other trusted hosts are accepted by the client. This is especially dangerous if users connect to their database via public networks (e.g. Internet).  References:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1883/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-08-24 19:35:48 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the PostgreSQL project   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-30 01:20:00 UTC  ``` Upstream down-rated the severity of this issue on making it public.  The default configuration in fact would validate host names, but it was possible to provide an SSLFactory that would not.  In 42.2.5, the documentation and API has been improved for clarity to avoid this mistake.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c3)  Doran Moppert    2018-08-30 01:20:25 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1883/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c5)  Borja Tarraso    2018-10-15 08:44:45 UTC  ``` Tower does not use any java stuff or any JDBC driver at all.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c6)  Richard Maciel Costa    2018-11-22 12:53:21 UTC  ``` CloudForms does not use java (it isn't even installed in the appliance), hence it is not affected.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2019-01-08 13:53:51 UTC  ``` Created postgresql-jdbc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1664337](show_bug.cgi?id=1664337 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10936 postgresql-jdbc: PostgreSQL: Postgres JDBC driver does not perform host name validation by default [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c8)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-09 00:40:36 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/cdeeaca47dc3bc6f727c79a582c9e4123099526e>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1622225#c9)  Doran Moppert    2019-04-09 00:44:18 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Applications using postgresql-jdbc should have their SSL configuration reviewed to ensure that host name verification is not disabled and only trusted CAs are accepted.  This vulnerability only impacts usage of postgresql-jdbc with a non-default SSL Factory, provided by the `sslfactory` parameter. If this parameter is not given, the default LibPQFactory is used, which is not vulnerable.   ``` |  |
