  "CVE-2018-10875": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in ansible. ansible.cfg is read from the current working directory which can be altered to make it point to a plugin or a module path under the control of an attacker, thus allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Ansible reads the ansible.cfg file from the current working directory. This can be exploited if an attacker can control the current working directory to point to a malicious ansible.cfg file, which in turn can point to a malicious plugin or module path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file loading",
        "Arbitrary code execution"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by controlling the ansible.cfg file.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local file manipulation",
        "Code injection"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate the current working directory where Ansible is executed or have write access to the current directory and create the malicious ansible.cfg file."
