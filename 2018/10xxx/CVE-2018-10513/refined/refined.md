- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data when processing `ID_AMSP_MASTER` requests in `coreServiceShell.exe`. The process fails to properly validate user-supplied data during request buffer parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of user-supplied data leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attackers with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
