{
  "CVE-2018-10938": {
    "description": "The CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that could cause a denial of service (infinite loop).",
    "root_cause": "The `cipso_v4_optptr` function in `net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c` did not correctly handle IPv4 options, specifically when the option length field is non-zero and the second byte of an option is zero.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of IP header options",
      "Infinite loop due to flawed loop condition"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system hang/infinite loop).",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, crafted network packets with specific IP options.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to a vulnerable system. The vulnerability requires a specific non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel."
