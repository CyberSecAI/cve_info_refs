## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A

remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that

could cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2018-10938](/security/CVE-2018-10938))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# CVE-2018-10938: Linux kernel: net: infinite loop in net/ipv4/cipso\_ipv4.c:cipso\_v4\_optptr() allows a remote DoS

```
Heololo,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4.
A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter
an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading
to a denial-of-service.

All the kernels with the cipso_v4_optptr() function which have not backported
the upstream commit 40413955ee26 are vulnerable.

Thanks to Yves Younan from Cisco for mentioning this.

References:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1622404>

Upstream Patch introduced the flaw:

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=04f81f0154e4bf002be6f4d85668ce1257efa4d9>

Upstream Patch fixed the flaw:

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=40413955ee265a5e42f710940ec78f5450d49149>

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary HFS+ volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3797-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that a integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A

remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that

could cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2018-10938](/security/CVE-2018-10938))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading to a denial-of-service. A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system before an attacker could leverage this flaw.

From <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7126#section-1>:    We note that data seems to indicate that there is a current    widespread practice of blocking IPv4 optioned packets.  I was unable to deliver an innocuous IP packet with IP options to both my Digital Ocean and AWS virtual private servers.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c5)  hayg    2018-08-28 23:23:42 UTC  ``` I'd like to point out that this attack is very difficult to execute over the WAN since packets with IPv4 options are often dropped by routers.

Thank you for pointing this out. Let me add, though, that nevertheless the flaw still exists and can be exploited in other environments.  > Also, *why* is Red Hat not bulnerable?  This is so as the code with the flaw is not present in the Red Hat's products: <https://access.redhat.com/labs/psb/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c8)  hayg    2018-08-29 17:42:01 UTC  ``` Thank you Vladis. I am rather upset by the reporting around this flaw. As far as I can tell this only affects SELinux enabled kernels which have a CIPSO rule added. Can you confirm whether that's the case? It is a huge deal that this is only an issue in the non-default configuration, and a rather niche one at that. I can tell you that I've already wasted 10s of hours on this because of the lack of detail which made it seem sensational.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c9)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-30 17:46:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to hayg from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c8))  Thank you for the update.   > this only affects SELinux enabled kernels which have a > CIPSO rule added. Can you confirm whether that's the case?  it is not only selinux but also SMACK.  could you, please, share the results of your research?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c10)  hayg    2018-08-30 18:39:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vladis Dronov from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c9)) Thank you for confirming. This puts me at ease.  > could you, please, share the results of your research? Pretty much what you just stated, that it affects only selinux and SMACK and only if you have a CIPSO rule enabled. This shrinks the affected audience to a much much smaller number of machines. Adding to this the fact that these packets will only be routed over the LAN (if that) and not the WAN, this does not even affect my org.   Thanks, Hayg   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c11)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-31 13:09:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to hayg from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c10)) > it affects only selinux and SMACK and only if you have a CIPSO rule enabled.  I've updated the flaw's description to make it clear, thank you.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1622404#c12)  hayg    2018-08-31 21:19:03 UTC  ``` Awesome, thanks Vladis! I hope this saves some folks time.   ``` |  |

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Cipso: cipso\_v4\_optptr enter infinite loopin for(),if((optlen > 0) && (optptr[1] == 0)), enter infinite loop.
Test: receive a packet which the ip length > 20 and the first byte of ip option is 0, produce this issue
