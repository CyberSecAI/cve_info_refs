Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10699:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Command injection vulnerability in the certificate upload functionality of the Moxa AWK-3121 device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `iw_privatePass` POST parameter within the `/forms/web_certUpload` endpoint is vulnerable to command injection via shell metacharacters.
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation of the `iw_privatePass` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the device. An attacker can inject shell commands, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via HTTP POST request to `/forms/web_certUpload`.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request containing malicious shell metacharacters in the `iw_privatePass` parameter.
- Exploitation can be achieved by Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by tricking an administrator into submitting a malicious request

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Moxa device's web interface.
- The attacker can be on the same network segment as the device or have network access to it.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator to perform an action on the vulnerable web page, this can be achieved via XSRF form.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable parameter is `iw_privatePass` in the web form.
- The vulnerability exists in the web server component, `iw_webs (Goahead)`.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) request is provided demonstrating the injection of shell commands via the `iw_privatePass` parameter.
