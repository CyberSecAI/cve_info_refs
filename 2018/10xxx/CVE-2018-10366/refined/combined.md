##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Front-end user management for October CMS.

### Requirements

* October CMS 3.6 or above
* The [AJAX Framework](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/cms/ajax/introduction.html) to be included in your layout/page

### Installation Instructions

Run the following to install this plugin:

```
php artisan plugin:install RainLab.User
```

To uninstall this plugin:

```
php artisan plugin:remove RainLab.User
```
### Older Versions

If you are using **October CMS v3.0 - v3.5**, install v2.1 with the following commands:

```
composer require rainlab/user-plugin "^2.1"
```

If you are using **October CMS v1.0 - v2.3**, install v1.7 with the following commands:

```
composer require rainlab/user-plugin "^1.7"
```
### Sample Theme

We recommend installing this plugin with the `RainLab.Vanilla` theme to demonstrate its functionality.

* <https://github.com/rainlab/vanilla-theme>

For extra functionality, consider also installing the `RainLab.UserPlus` plugin.

* <https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-userplus>

### Managing Users

Users are managed on the Users tab found in the admin panel. Each user provides minimal data fields - **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email** and **Password**. The Name can represent either the person's first name or their full name, making the Last Name field optional, depending on the complexity of your site.

Below the **Email** field is an checkbox to block all outgoing mail sent to the user. This is a useful feature for accounts with an email address that is bouncing mail or has reported spam. When checked, no mail will ever be sent to this address, except for the mail template used for resetting the password.

### Plugin Settings

This plugin creates a Settings menu item, found by navigating to **Settings > Users > User Settings**. This page allows the setting of common features, described in more detail below.

#### Sign In

By default a User will sign in to the site using their email address as a unique identifier. You may use a unique login name instead by changing the **Login Attribute** value to Username. This will introduce a new field called **Username** for each user, allowing them to specify their own short name or alias for identification. Both the Email address and Username must be unique to the user.

As a security precaution, you may restrict users from having sessions across multiple devices at the same time. Enable the **Prevent Concurrent Sessions** setting to use this feature. When a user signs in to their account, it will automatically sign out the user for all other sessions.

#### Registration

Registration to the site is allowed by default. If you are running a closed site, or need to temporarily disable registration, you may disable this feature by switching **Allow user registration** to the OFF setting.

#### Notifications

When a user is first activated, they can be sent a welcome email. To activate the welcome email, select "Notify User" and an email template from the **User Message Template** dropdown. The default message template used is `user:welcome_email` and you can customize this by selecting **Mail > Mail Templates** from the settings menu.

The same applies for notifying the system administrators when a new user joins, with the "Notify Administrators" checkbox. The administrators to notify are selected using **Notify Admin Group** dropdown.

##### The following plugins extend or depend on the plugin

  October has an amazing potential for becoming a #1 CMS and an Application Development System. But at the moment a lot of these capabilities are not implemented state of the art.

  The user plugin is quite typical for that. One the one hand easy to install, easy to use and working properly. On the other hand the real potential for practical use is not given. As for example: no user extendable fields, no expandable user rights and of course no relational tables. Thanks to Ivan Doric and his YouTube tutorials one can learn how to do so - but the old fashioned way. (So sadly I had to decide to dismiss the user plugin and write our own one)

  Anyhow with these steps forward October could be one of the best systems I know. I am observing now the development for almost two years, but I am missing hints for these crucial steps - still hoping they will come soon! May be a more active community would be helpful? (eg see the bug and feature system of LimeSurvey)

  Maybe it will help some one If you use custom layout:

  1. do not forget to add {% framework extra %} at the end of layout. Otherwise AJAX will not work
  2. # add at the (!) top of layout file [account] redirect = "dashboard" paramCode = "code" forceSecure = 0

     Otherwise you will get onRegister and onSignin not found

  Lovely theme with a nice and easy to use page builder. Used this theme for developing a new website for a client. At the same time I was discovering and learning the October Content Management System. While walking this path, I noticed that the support of the theme-developer is excellent ...

  Guys, it's nice to have so many localizations, but none of the form partials use them. (For example the login partial).
  I see you had a lot of work with the loc files, but your plugin only use the half of them , because in the templates the text is hardwired.
  Except this, the plugin is great.

After registering the page is refreshed, fields are empty and no user is being created in the backend....what can I possibly be doing wrong while it seems so simple?

  This plugin works well for single contact form or if you have the patience to redo everything if you have multiple forms each page. Though very useful it lacks some of the need functionality that will make it a great plugins like:

  1. Duplicate Forms - So you can only add/remove needed fields
  2. Export Forms - this is a must specially when you need to test your forms locally and exporting them to your production, well you can do this by going directly to database but that forfeits the purpose of having a CMS.
  3. Docs need to be updated and more examples will be helpful (e.g. Date pickers using bootstrap)
  4. Better formatting, though you can get around using bootstrap

  Overall, I'm happy with the plugin

  The user plugin will be required by the vast majority of sites for commenting on content and helping to prevent spamming. Adding the plugin to the base installation gives a massive advantage to sites that require user access. Although it could be more detailed, it is a good framework which can be expanded upon.

  Too many plugins relying on this one plugin, having to extend everything in the boot section of the Plugin.php, Cannot extend models because of this reliance. ( I was able to override the auth facade, however relations remain unable to be overridden because of the the extending features).

  Its a good plugin, but the fact that every other plugin has a developer being forced to use it really does not work out well. Its a huge barrier that needs to be fixed, mainly issue with extending needs to be fixed.

  As a PHP user for over 15 years and a Laravel advocate for the past 3, I've gotta say I'm really loving OctoberCMS. I had built and maintained my own PHP web framework for years, but when it became to unwieldy to continue to maintain, I searched high and low for something that would replace all the functionality I'd spent so long creating, and October, thus far, has delivered in spades. The User plugin is a basic scaffolding for end user accounts, written cleanly and simply enough that it is easy to extend once you wrap your head around October's coding conventions. I started using October on a project-for-hire, but as soon as I finish that up, I'll be redesigning two of my personal sites using October as well.

  f you desire to login with username instead of email address, then provided username is added to the registration form (in additon to email) and the login form (instead of email) then the documentation suggests it will work. However, registration saves the username as the email address, regardless of what username is specified. The only way I have managed to solve this is to make the following one line addition to the plugin code {Rainlab/User/Models/User}:

  ```
      protected $fillable = [
          'name',
          'login',
          'email',
          'password',
          'password_confirmation',
          'company',
          'phone',
          'street_addr',
          'city',
          'zip',
          'country',
          'state',
          'username'    // NOTE I HAVE ADDED THIS
      ];

  The plugin has good functionality but not very nice error handling/display. I got round this by editing Account.php (which was a last resort as will now need to be careful when plugin is updated)....The areas of changed code are in function onSignin() as below:

  ```
          $validation = Validator::make($data, $rules);
          if ($validation->fails()) {
              $flash_message = "";
              $messages = $validation->messages();
              foreach ($messages->all() as $message)
              {
                  if ($flash_message != "")
                      $flash_message = $flash_message . " and ";
                  $flash_message = $flash_message . $message;
              }
              Flash::error($flash_message);
              return Redirect::to('account');
          }

          /*
           * Authenticate user (MODIFIED for FLASH MESSAGES)
           */
          try {
              $user = Auth::authenticate([
                  'login' => array_get($data, 'login'),
                  'password' => array_get($data, 'password')
              ], true);
          }
          catch (Exception $ex) {
              Flash::error($ex->getMessage());
              return Redirect::to('account'); //redirect back to login if errors
          }
          /*
           * Redirect to the intended page after successful sign in
           */
          $redirectUrl = $this->pageUrl($this->property('redirect'));
          Flash::error('User authenticated! ' . $user);
          if ($redirectUrl = post('redirect', $redirectUrl))
              return Redirect::intended($redirectUrl);
  ```

  Very useful plugin. It just lacks nicer error messages, but apart from that I find it really useful and I am very glad I don't have to use drupal or joomla anymore for user-oriented portals.

### Upgrading from User v2 to v3

This guide can be used to help migrate from RainLab.User v1-v2 to v3. Some theme changes are required to since there are new components.

**Please make sure you have a database and website backup before performing the upgrade.**

### Upgrade Instructions

1. **Make sure you are running October CMS v3.6 or greater.**
2. Run `php artisan plugin:install rainlab.user` to request the latest version (you do not need to uninstall v2 first).
3. Continue using this plugin as normal.
4. Clean up unused table data using `php artisan user:migratev1` (optional).

### Previewing Changes

We recommend installing the `RainLab.Vanilla` theme to demonstrate the latest functionality.

* <https://github.com/rainlab/vanilla-theme>

### Compatible Plugins

If you are using the following plugins, please upgrade them to v2.0 at the same time as this plugin:

| Package | New Version |
| --- | --- |
| `rainlab/forum-plugin` | ^2.0 |
| `rainlab/location-plugin` | ^2.0 |
| `rainlab/userplus-plugin` | ^2.0 |
| `rainlab/notify-plugin` | Optional |

If you are using the `rainlab/notify-plugin` for sending the new user notifications, you may uninstall this plugin since these notifications are now included in the user settings.

### Key Differences

* Laravel's authentication system is used as the underlying technology.
* Two-Factor authentication is provided out of the box.
* A User Log has been implemented to track and audit user actions, such as changing email address.
* An Address Book component has been added to the UserPlus plugin.
* The Forum plugin has the ability to "Poke" users to demonstrate the `notifications` component.

### Breaking Changes

### Renamed Settings Model

The `RainLab\User\Models\Settings` model has been renamed to `RainLab\User\Models\Setting` for consistency with the core system design.

### Renamed JWT Auth Method

The `Auth::checkBearerToken` has been renamed to `Auth::loginUsingBearerToken` to be more descriptive of its outcome. The `Auth::checkBearerToken` method still exists and will return the user or `false`, instead of logging in the user internally.

### Account Component Split Up

The functionality of the `Account` component has been split in to three components:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Account` | Update user details, enable two factor, delete sessions, delete the user account |
| `Authentication` | Authenticate a user |
| `Registration` | Register a new user |

### Session Component

The `allowedUserGroups` property has been removed from the `Session` component. This can be supplemented by some Twig code:

```
{% if not user.inGroup('premium-users') %}
    {% do redirect('account/login') %}
{% endif }
```
### Require Activation is Removed

The "Require Activation" functionality has been removed from the settings page for simplicity. The replacement approach below is more flexible, since custom pages or banners can be used based on the requirements.

A user can be checked if they are verified using Twig:

```
{% if not user.hasVerifiedEmail %}
    {% do redirect('account/login') %}
{% endif %}
```

Checking administrator approval is possible by creating an "Approved User" user group and placing approved users in that group.

Alternatively, by extending the users database table with a `is_approved` field. Then check in Twig:

```
{% if not user.is_approved %}
    {% do redirect('account/login') %}
{% endif %}
```
### MailBlocker model replaced by UserPreference

The `RainLab\User\Models\MailBlocker` model has been replaced by `RainLab\User\Models\UserPreference`. The classes function differently and `UserPreference` is more generic for controlling user preferences.

### Events Updated

The following event names have changed:

* New events added to [the events documentation](./docs/events.md).
* Removed **rainlab.user.reactivate** event, since users can no longer reactivate their account without help from an administrator.

### Feedback

If there are any changes you would like us to include to make upgrading easier, let us know and we can accommodate them in a new release.

Thanks for reading.
