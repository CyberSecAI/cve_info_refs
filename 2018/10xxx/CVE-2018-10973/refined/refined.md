- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `transferMulti` function of an Ethereum ERC20 token smart contract.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `amount` variable, which is used to accumulate the total transfer amount, is susceptible to integer overflow due to unchecked addition of `_value[j]` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the `_value` parameters to cause an integer overflow, resulting in `amount` becoming significantly smaller than the actual sum of `_value` elements. This allows an attacker to bypass the balance check (`require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount)`). Subsequently, the attacker can increase their digital assets by transferring more tokens to them than their original balance.
- **Attack vectors:** By calling the `transferMulti` function with a crafted array of `_value` parameters designed to trigger an integer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable smart contract by calling the `transferMulti` function. They must be able to submit transactions and control the `_to` and `_value` arguments.
