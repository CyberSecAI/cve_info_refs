Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when exporting data to a CSV file. Specifically, it does not sanitize the "First Name" field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The vulnerability is a CSV Injection issue. By inserting a specially crafted string (e.g., `=cmd|'/C calc'!A1`) into a user profile field, an attacker can inject formulas into a CSV file. When the CSV is opened in a spreadsheet program, the injected command is executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact is the ability to achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine when the exported CSV file is opened. This can lead to various malicious activities, including malware installation, data theft, or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Profile Manipulation:** An authenticated employee user can inject the malicious payload by modifying their own profile's "First Name" field.
*   **Admin Action:** An admin user must then export data containing the injected payload as a CSV, and then open the file with a vulnerable spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Employee Access:** The attacker needs to have valid employee-level credentials to modify the profile.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to induce an administrator to export the manipulated data into a CSV file. The admin must then open the CSV with a vulnerable spreadsheet application to trigger the code execution.

**Technical Details:**
The payload `=cmd|'/C calc'!A1` is used as a proof of concept, which will execute the windows calculator application upon opening the exported CSV file in Microsoft Excel. The `cmd` function is used to invoke a command, `/C` tells the command interpreter to execute and terminate, and `calc` is the command to start calculator.

**Additional Notes:**
The content mentions that the vulnerable software is "HRSALE The Ultimate HRM 1.0.2". The vendor homepage is listed as codecanyon.net and the software is available for purchase through that site.

This vulnerability is a classic case of CSV injection, where a lack of input sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious formulas into exported CSV files.
