- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `nordvpn-service` service in NordVPN for Windows establishes a `NetNamedPipe` endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `Connect` method accepts a class instance argument that allows an attacker to control the `OpenVpn` command line.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that will execute code in the context of the `SYSTEM` user, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: By connecting to the `NetNamedPipe` endpoint, any application can call the exposed methods, including the vulnerable `Connect` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an application installed on the same system as the vulnerable NordVPN software to interact with the `NetNamedPipe` endpoint.
