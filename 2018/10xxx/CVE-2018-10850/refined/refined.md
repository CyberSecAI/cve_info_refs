  "CVE-2018-10850": {
    "description": "389-ds-base before versions 1.4.0.10, 1.3.8.3 is vulnerable to a race condition in the way 389-ds-base handles persistent search, resulting in a crash if the server is under load. An anonymous attacker could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the way 389-ds-base handles persistent search connections due to an incorrect reference count (refcnt) management. When a connection is being cleaned up (upon closure, timeout etc.), the core server waits for the refcnt to reach zero, indicating that all pending requests have completed. However, persistent search requests were not accounted for correctly, allowing the server to reset the connection structure while a persistent search request was still in progress, potentially causing a crash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Incorrect Reference Count Handling",
        "Unsynchronized Access to Shared Resources"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) through a server crash. Under heavy load the server is more susceptible to the race condition leading to a crash",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An anonymous, remote attacker capable of initiating persistent search requests to the server is able to trigger the vulnerability, particularly under high server load."
