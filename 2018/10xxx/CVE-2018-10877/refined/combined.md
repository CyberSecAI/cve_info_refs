## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3753-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2948)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

Debian Bug     : 860900 872907 892057 896775 897590 898137

Linux 4.9 has been packaged for Debian 8 as linux-4.9.  This provides
a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use kernel
packages from the "jessie-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 3.16, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    hyperv-daemons libcpupower1 libcpupower-dev libusbip-dev
    linux-compiler-gcc-4.9-x86 linux-cpupower linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from other source packages
in Debian 8.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-18255

    It was discovered that the performance events subsystem did not
    properly validate the value of the
    kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent sysctl.  Setting a large value
    could have an unspecified security impact.  However, only a
    privileged user can set this sysctl.

CVE-2018-1118

    The syzbot software found that the vhost driver did not initialise
    message buffers which would later be read by user processes.  A
    user with access to the /dev/vhost-net device could use this to
    read sensitive information from the kernel or other users'
    processes.

CVE-2018-1120

    Qualys reported that a user able to mount FUSE filesystems can
    create a process such that when another process attempting to read
    its command line will be blocked for an arbitrarily long time.
    This could be used for denial of service, or to aid in exploiting
    a race condition in the other program.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-3639

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context.  In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox.  This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update allows the issue to be mitigated on some x86
    processors by disabling SSB.  This requires an update to the
    processor's microcode, which is non-free.  It may be included in
    an update to the system BIOS or UEFI firmware, or in a future
    update to the intel-microcode or amd64-microcode packages.

    Disabling SSB can reduce performance significantly, so by default
    it is only done in tasks that use the seccomp feature.
    Applications that require this mitigation should request it
    explicitly through the prctl() system call.  Users can control
    where the mitigation is enabled with the spec_store_bypass_disable
    kernel parameter.

CVE-2018-5814

    Jakub Jirasek reported race conditions in the USB/IP host driver.
    A malicious client could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption), and possibly to execute code, on a
    USB/IP server.

CVE-2018-10021

    A physically present attacker who unplugs a SAS cable can cause a
    denial of service (memory leak and WARN).

CVE-2018-10087, CVE-2018-10124

    zhongjiang found that the wait4() and kill() system call
    implementations did not check for the invalid pid value of
    INT_MIN.  If a user passed this value, the behaviour of the code
    was formally undefined and might have had a security impact.

CVE-2018-10853

    Andy Lutomirski and Mika Penttilä reported that KVM for x86
    processors did not perform a necessary privilege check when
    emulating certain instructions.  This could be used by an
    unprivileged user in a guest VM to escalate their privileges
    within the guest.

CVE-2018-10876, CVE-2018-10877, CVE-2018-10878, CVE-2018-10879,
CVE-2018-10880, CVE-2018-10881, CVE-2018-10882, CVE-2018-10883

    Wen Xu at SSLab, Gatech, reported that crafted ext4 filesystem
    images could trigger a crash or memory corruption.  A local user
    able to mount arbitrary filesystems, or an attacker providing
    filesystems to be mounted, could use this for denial of service or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the optical disc driver (cdrom) does
    not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED
    ioctl.  A user with access to a cdrom device could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-11506

    Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira reported that the
    SCSI optical disc driver (sr) did not allocate a sufficiently
    large buffer for sense data.  A user with access to a SCSI
    optical disc device that can produce more than 64 bytes of
    sense data could use this to cause a denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption), and possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12233

    Shankara Pailoor reported that a crafted JFS filesystem image
    could trigger a denial of service (memory corruption).  This
    could possibly also be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000204

    The syzbot software found that the SCSI generic driver (sg) would
    in some circumstances allow reading data from uninitialised
    buffers, which could include sensitive information from the kernel
    or other tasks.  However, only privileged users with the
    CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability were allowed to do this,
    so this has little or no security impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-1~deb8u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#860900, #872907, #892057, #896775, #897590, and #898137; and
includes many more bug fixes from stable updates 4.9.89-4.9.110
inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-44-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed)
  -

  -
  [4.15.0.44.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta/4.15.0.44.46)
* [linux-image-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta)
  -
  [4.15.0.44.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta/4.15.0.44.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1596795#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-29 17:54:43 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Linux kernel ext4 filesystem. An out-of-bound access is possible in the ext4_ext_drop_refs() function when operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.  References:  <https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199417>  <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/929744/>  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=bc890a60247171294acc0bd67d211fa4b88d40ba>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1596795#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-29 17:55:56 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1596797](show_bug.cgi?id=1596797 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10877 kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4_ext_drop_refs function with a crafted ext4 image [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1596795#c4)  Justin M.

An unprivileged attacker cannot do this even from a user+mount namespace:  $ unshare -U -r -m # mount -t ext4 fs.img mnt/ mount: mnt/: mount failed: Operation not permitted.  The article <https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/> discusses unprivileged user mounts and hostile filesystem images:   > ... for the most part, the mount() system call is denied to processes running > within user namespaces, even if they are privileged in their namespaces.  It also states that unprivileged filesystem mounts are not allowed as of now in the Linux kernel and probably won't be allowed in a future. Until that such flaws are considered as not exploitable:  > There were no proposals for solutions to the hostile-filesystem problem. > But, in the absence of some sort of assurance that they can be made safe, > unprivileged filesystem mounts are unlikely to gain acceptance; even if the > feature gets into the kernel, distributions would be likely to disable it.  On the other hand, there is a potential possibility that still an attacker can trick a regular user to mount a malicious filesystem image, like trick him to insert an usb-flash-drive with a forged filesystem to a desktop system which will auto-mount it. In case this results only in a system crash (a DoS due to, for example, a NULL pointer dereference) the flaw impact is low but it still exists. In case of a flaw which results in a privilege escalation the flaw's impact is higher.  So the Red Hat would still consider bugs which require mounting a filesystem image to exploit as security flaws, though with Low severity.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1596795#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 09:02:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2948)   ``` |  |

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-2671](/security/CVE-2017-2671))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

It was discovered that a memory leak existed in the Serial Attached SCSI

(SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2018-10021](/security/CVE-2018-10021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

An unprivileged attacker cannot do this even from a user+mount namespace:  $ unshare -U -r -m # mount -t ext4 fs.img mnt/ mount: mnt/: mount failed: Operation not permitted.  The article <https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/> discusses unprivileged user mounts and hostile filesystem images:   > ... for the most part, the mount() system call is denied to processes running > within user namespaces, even if they are privileged in their namespaces.  It also states that unprivileged filesystem mounts are not allowed as of now in the Linux kernel and probably won't be allowed in a future.

On the other hand, there is a potential possibility that still an attacker can trick a regular user to mount a malicious filesystem image, like trick him to insert an usb-flash-drive with a forged filesystem to a desktop system which will auto-mount it. In case this results only in a system crash (a DoS due to, for example, a NULL pointer dereference) the flaw impact is low but it still exists. In case of a flaw which results in a privilege escalation the flaw's impact is higher.  So the Red Hat would still consider bugs which require mounting a filesystem image to exploit as security flaws, though with Low severity.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1596802#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:34:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3083 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3083](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3083)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1596802#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 07:40:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3096 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3096](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3096)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1596802#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 09:02:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2948)   ``` |  |

So the Red Hat would still consider bugs which require mounting a filesystem image to exploit as security flaws, though with Low severity.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1596795#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 09:02:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2948)   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-hwe) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS-HWE) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
