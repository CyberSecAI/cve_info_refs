| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1090051#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2018-04-18 12:12:09 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1086416](show_bug.cgi?id=1086416 "RESOLVED FIXED") +++  sz can segfault in zsdata():  Core was generated by `sz core.0.26368.1520276402.sz.11'. Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault. #0  zsdata (buf=0x611120 "core.0.26368.1520276402.sz.11", length=0, frameend=104) at zm.c:435 435                     zsendline(*buf); crc = updcrc((0377 & *buf), crc); (gdb) bt #0  zsdata (buf=0x611120 "core.0.26368.1520276402.sz.11", length=0, frameend=104) at zm.c:435 #1  0x00000000004041d1 in zsendfdata (zi=0x7fff17356e90) at lsz.c:2143 #2  0x0000000000404fcc in zsendfile (blen=<optimized out>, buf=<optimized out>, zi=<optimized out>) at lsz.c:1889 #3  wctxpn (zi=0x7fff17356e90) at lsz.c:1260 #4  0x00000000004057a9 in wcs (oname=0x7fff1735859d "core.0.26368.1520276402.sz.11", remotename=0x7fff17355d50 "core.0.26368.1520276402.sz.11")     at lsz.c:1132 #5  0x0000000000406311 in wcsend (argc=1, argp=<optimized out>) at lsz.c:925 #6  0x00000000004081ea in main (argc=389378616, argv=0x7fff17357210) at lsz.c:792 (gdb)  So zsdata(*buf, length, frameend) was called with length = 0. It does the following:  void zsdata(const char *buf, size_t length, int frameend) {         // .. unsigned short crc = 0 .. printf() ..          do {                 zsendline(*buf); crc = updcrc((0377 & *buf), crc);                 buf++;         } while (--length>0); [..] }  length is of type size_t, i.e. unsigned int. Subtracting one from zero will wrap length to a positive value. So the loop will run until either length becomes 0 again or dereferencing the buf pointer triggers a segfault, whatever comes first (the latter, of course.)  Calling zsdata() with zero length is intentional, BTW. This is where it got called from:    if (c != ZACK) {     ZSDATA (txbuf, 0, ZCRCE);     goto gotack;   }  ...and various other places.  This bug might leak information to the receiver before sz finally crashes, so it likely has security impact. The same build of the package is present up to SLES 11 SP4. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1090051#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2018-04-18 12:12:54 UTC  ``` Requested a CVE for this.

# lrzsz: free x/y/zmodem implementation

---

*lrzsz* is a unix communication package providing the
XMODEM, YMODEM
[ZMODEM](http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/zmodem.html) file transfer protocols.
lrzsz is a heavily rehacked version of the last public domain
release of
[Omen Technologies](http://www.omen.com/) *rzsz*
package, and is now
[free software](http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/free-sw.html)
and released under the
[GNU General Public Licence](http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/copyleft/gpl.html).

---

### Features of lrzsz

* very portable, automagically configured with GNU *autoconf*.* crash recovery.* up to 8KB block sizes (ZMODEM8K).* internationalized (using GNU *gettext*). German translation
        of the programs output exists.* far more secure than the original sources.* high performance. say `make vcheck-z' and have a look at
            the BPS rate - i recently saw *1.4 MB per second*
            transfering a large file through pipes (on a I586/133 system.
            Beat that!).* good blocksize calculation (tries to compute an optimal
              blocksize based on the number of errors occured).* It's [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

---

### Downloading lrzsz

The lastest release is
[lrzsz-0.12.20.tar.gz](../releases/lrzsz-0.12.20.tar.gz) (*(about 270KB)*).

---

### Recent changes

* Version 0.12.20 - December 1998, Uwe Ohse
  + works on BeOS and stone-aged SCO (sco-3.2v4.2)+ pubdir-"feature" works again.+ "make rpm" creates a rpm file.+ "optimal blklen calculation" was too aggressive, it
          now does nothing if the user demands fixed blklens.+ various smaller and medium bug fixes.+ a more or less important security bug is fixed (stupid
              use of /tmp in a piece of code which is rarely used).+ lrz uses umask to make files unreadable which receiving them.+ "sh systype | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de"
                  sends a success report with a description of the
                  system type.+ --enable-syslog is now default* Version 0.12.19 - January 1998, Uwe Ohse

    (sorry, i forgot to announce that version here. -- uwe, 9.5.1998)
    + 0.12.18 was broken, lsz crashed if receiver found an CRC error.+ lrz options "--rename" and "--escape" didn't work.+ lrz didn't implement senders "overwrite-or-skip" option.+ added dejagnu testsuite. Maybe you need a dejagnu snapshot to use it.* Version 0.12.18 - November 1997
       **keep off - this version has a major bug**
      + syslog output now includes user name.+ new script lrzszbug, to be used for bugreports (untested)+ lots of compiler warnings (egcs -Wparanoia [many -W]) removed.+ new options --tcp-server and --tcp-client ADDRESS:PORT for both programs.
              (this is not too much code bloat, and somewhat useful for me - but i
              suspect nobody else will need it. Oh well)+ updated to gettext-0.10.32+ updated to automake-1.2* Version 0.12.17 - August 1997
        + internal cleanup.+ portability enhancements by (Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>)+ lsz has a new option "--tcp" (no shortopt implemented). lsz transmits
              one file over normal stdin/stdout (a control file), then opens a
              tcp connection to transmit all other files.

              That *might* be useful if your telnetd is really stupid.This version was \_not\_ put on the ftp/http servers.* Version 0.12.16 - March 1997
          + major performance improvement (less CPU time needed - don't expect
            faster transfers over slow lines). *make vcheck* now show about 50%
            more throughput.+ updated to gettext-0.12.27 and automake-1.1l
              (automake-1.1l bug: AC\_SUBST in AM\_PATH\_PROG\_WITH\_TEST leads
              to a "$1=@$1@" line in Makefile.in. I hacked around it in
              /usr/share/aclocal/gettext.m4).* Version 0.12.15 - February 1997
            + lrzsz now compiles even with pre-ANSI-compilers (tested with
              the HPUX 9.00 bundled compiler - what a bad program. Shame on HP).+ lrz supports a new option --o-sync, which forces it to open the
                output file in synchronous write mode. Don't use it unless you
                are using interrupts if update writes to the disk.* Version 0.12.14 - January 1997
              + lrzsz now compiles cleaner on SCO, HPUX.+ improved error reporting (i think there are still possibilities
                  for further improvements, if anybody case spare time :-)).* Version 0.12.13 - January 1997
                + no user visible changes. just a maintainance release.+ updated to gettext-0.12.26.* Version 0.12.12 - January 1997
                  + lrx and lrb (aka lsz --x/ymodem) now default to 128 byte
                    block length (to fix interoperatability problems with
                    some Xmodems [USR courier flash upload]).+ lrz didn't recognize every short option.+ minor performance tweaks.+ replace mktime() if needed.+ updated to autoconf 2.12.* Version 0.12.11 - October 1996
                    + lsz/lrz recognize "rshell" as another name for the restricted
                      shell.+ lrz/lsz recognize a new option *--stop-at HH:MM* (stop
                        transmission at HH:MM), and *--stop-at +N* (stop in N seconds).+ lrz/lsz recognize a new option *--delay-startup N*:
                          wait *N* seconds before doing anything.+ doesn't hang anymore on BSD machines after getting a timeout
                            (BSD restarts system calls after an interrupt - this made
                            timeout code useless).+ SIGINT handling turned on unter linux too (i still don't
                              know why it was turned off under linux (and only there)).+ *sz -* now prints better transfer statistics after if
                                reading from a pipe.* Version 0.12.10 - September 1996
                      + lsz resends init string if it doesn't receive rz's init.+ improved "make check". By Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ulb.ac.be>+ "sz -" should work again. This will not work if sz cannot read from
                            stdout.+ portability enhancements by Philippe De Muyter <phdm@info.ulb.ac.be>* Version 0.12.9 - September 1996
                        + New options --min-bps N and --min-bps-time M: If BPS rate falls under N
                          for at least M seconds (default: 120) transmission will be stopped.+ added some missing error messages.+ updated manual pages.* Version 0.12.8 - August 1996
                          + sz and rz now know about a new option:
                            -E, --rename: change name if target exists.+ new option -T, --turbo for sz: sz doesn't escape 4 special characters
                              if this option is given (this should not make problems with any
                              rz, but could be problematic on certain links where this characters
                              have to be escaped).+ debugged blocksize calculation.+ -+, --append option fixed.

---

### Future developement

* enhance portability.* use VMIN code some day (it's not hard to implement. it's hard
    to automagically check if VMIN works. It doesn't on older BSD
    versions).* make argv[0]-recognition of X/Y/Z-mode work with
      program\_name\_transform.* write a decent documentation.

---

### Comments

* i will not say anything about the original unix zmodem sources.
  Just look at them and you'll know (even lrzsz is still worse
  than i like it to be).* the zmodem protocol is a pretty good example of a proprietary
    protocol:
    + There are some proprietary, undocumented protocol
      extensions made by the original author. Furthermore they
      are implemented in such a way that nobody else can
      extend the protocol in a safe way.+ There is no way to get extensions included into the
        *standard*.+ The protocol is not too good designed. It's impossible to extend
          it in a safe way to transfer files in both directions.+ Security was not an issue to the author. The ability to
            let the receiver execute any command the sender tells
            him is nothing more then a really large security hole
            (as large as running older sendmail versions). Hackers
            dreams came true.* On the other hand it has some really good points - especially
      it is high efficient, and is, if implemented correctly, usable
      over a number of transmission channels nobody thought of at
      the time the protocol was designed.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-26 06:03:46 UTC  ``` Lrzsz has an integer overflow vulernability in the src/zm.c:zsdata() function. An attacker could exploit this with the sz command to cause a crash or potentially leak information to the receiving server.   Additional References:  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1090051>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-26 06:04:08 UTC  ``` Created lrzsz tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1572059](show_bug.cgi?id=1572059 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2018-10195 lrzsz: Integer overflow in src/zm.c:zsdata() causes crash in sz and can leak information to receiver [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c3)  Miroslav Lichvar    2018-04-26 13:56:17 UTC  ``` Does this affect our packages?  We have the following patch (added for [bug #75473](show_bug.cgi?id=75473 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - Bug with 16 bit ZMODEM transfer")), which fixes the zsdata() function to handle a length of zero: <https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/lrzsz.git/tree/lrzsz-0.12.20.patch>  The changelog of the SUSE package indicates it was fixed in the 0.12.21rc version, but that seems to be a different bug, which is related to zero-length files and mmap().   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c4)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-27 05:38:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Miroslav Lichvar from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c3)) > Does this affect our packages? >  > We have the following patch (added for [bug #75473](show_bug.cgi?id=75473 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - Bug with 16 bit ZMODEM transfer")), which fixes the zsdata() > function to handle a length of zero: > <https://src.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/lrzsz.git/tree/lrzsz-0.12.20.patch> >  > The changelog of the SUSE package indicates it was fixed in the 0.12.21rc > version, but that seems to be a different bug, which is related to > zero-length files and mmap().  I overlooked the patch, so I think you are correct and our packages are not affected. Happy for this bug and it's trackers to be closed as NOTABUG.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1572058#c5)  Cedric Buissart    2018-04-27 09:34:18 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of lrzsz as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. A patch was already applied for this vulnerability.   ``` |  |
