  "CVE-2018-10237": {
    "description": "The vulnerability stems from unbounded memory allocation in the `AtomicDoubleArray` and `CompoundOrdering` classes within the Guava library. These classes, when serialized, eagerly allocate memory based on sizes received from the client without proper validation. An attacker could send crafted data during deserialization, forcing the server to consume all available memory, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attackers sending crafted serialized data during deserialization."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker capable of sending serialized data to the vulnerable server.",
    "root_cause": "Eager memory allocation in `AtomicDoubleArray` and `CompoundOrdering` classes without proper input validation, allowing attacker-controlled size parameters during deserialization to allocate arbitrary amounts of memory.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability affects applications that use Guava versions 11.0 through 24.x (prior to 24.1.1), specifically when deserializing untrusted data using Java serialization or GWT-RPC. The fix involves eliminating eager memory allocation in Guava 24.1.1 and 25.0."
