Attackers can leverage the vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker can be remote, but requires the user to interact with a malicious file or visit a malicious page."
