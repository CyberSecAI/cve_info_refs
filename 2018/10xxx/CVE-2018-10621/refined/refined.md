Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. The application uses a fixed-length stack buffer. When a value larger than the buffer's capacity is read from a .dpa file into this buffer, it leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-121**: Stack-based buffer overflow. The software does not properly validate the size of the input before writing it to a stack buffer, leading to potential overwrite of adjacent memory locations on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite the stack, potentially injecting and executing arbitrary code.
- Application crash. The overflow can corrupt the stack, leading to application instability and crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted .dpa file.
- The attack is remotely exploitable.
- Low skill level is needed to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted .dpa file to the application. This can be done remotely and requires low skill level to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft versions 4.00.04 and prior.
- This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities reported by B0nd @garagehackers working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.3, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
