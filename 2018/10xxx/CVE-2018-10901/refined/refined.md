{
  "CVE-2018-10901": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.",
    "Root cause": "The VMX code in the KVM virtualization subsystem fails to restore the GDT.LIMIT to its original host value upon VM exit.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restoration of the GDT.LIMIT during VM exits.",
      "Use of a fixed 64KB GDT limit instead of restoring the original value."
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation within the host system. By manipulating the GDT, malicious userspace code can place malicious entries, specifically to per-cpu variables.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by a user with the ability to execute code within the host's user space. An attacker needs to be running on a vulnerable system (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6) with KVM virtualization enabled.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to execute code in host's userspace, ability to trigger VM exits."
  }
