```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `award_id` parameter in the HRSALE application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, modify database records, or potentially gain control over the database server by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `admin/user/read_awards` endpoint with a malicious payload within the `award_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and does not need prior authentication to exploit this blind SQL Injection.
