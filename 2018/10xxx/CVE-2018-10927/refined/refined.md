  "CVE-2018-10927": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_lookup_req in glusterfs server. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to leak information and execute remote denial of service by crashing gluster brick process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the RPC request processing using `gfs3_lookup_req` in the GlusterFS server. Specifically, it seems related to how file status information is handled during the lookup operation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leak",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak file status information and also cause a denial-of-service condition by crashing the gluster brick process.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through network-based RPC requests to the GlusterFS server using the vulnerable `gfs3_lookup_req` function.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the GlusterFS server to send malicious RPC requests.",
      "affected_components": [
        "glusterfs server",
         "gfs3_lookup_req RPC"
      ]
    },
    "affected_products": [
        "Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4",
        "Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor",
        "Debian glusterfs",
        "openSUSE glusterfs"

    ],
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted filenames during the `gfs3_lookup_req` RPC. This can lead to information disclosure by leaking arbitrary file status information and crash the brick process, causing denial of service. The vulnerability resides within the glusterfs-server component which is not shipped with RHEL 6 and 7, but is included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor."
