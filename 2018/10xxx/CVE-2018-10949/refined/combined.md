| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=108962#c0)  Sandesh Almeida    2018-05-09 11:29:17 EDT  ``` Zimbra supports multiple modes of authentication; for instance when connecting via the web interface, supports web authentication via POST request that respects best practices in terms of security. For compatibility with other services, it also supports basic authentication, via the authentication header (Authentication: Basic base64(user:password) )  Netragard noticed however, that some services that are normally protected via Web Auth, can also be accessed via basic authentication by forcing it in the request parameters.  When using this approach, Zimbra will technically return two distinct error messages when the user is present in the system or not:      When the user is not present, an HTTP 404 - account is not active is returned; - When the user is present, an HTTP 401 - must authenticate is returned.     Using this distinction, it is therefore possible to perform a user enumeration when knowing the domain which is supported within Zimbra. ``` |  |
