- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Zimbra services, which are normally protected by Web authentication, can be accessed using basic authentication by forcing it in the request parameters. This results in different HTTP error codes depending on whether the user exists in the system or not.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Account enumeration vulnerability (CWE-203). The system discloses information about the existence of user accounts by responding with different HTTP error codes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use the different HTTP error codes (404 for non-existent accounts and 401 for existent accounts) to enumerate valid user accounts on the Zimbra server, just knowing a domain supported by Zimbra.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a request that forces basic authentication and checking the response, an attacker can determine if an account exists on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Zimbra server and analyze the returned HTTP status codes. The attacker does not need prior access to the system or credentials.
