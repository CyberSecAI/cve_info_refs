**The content relates to the CVE.**

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When processing a symtab entry with "SECTION" type and "0" value, objcopy fails to check pointer `sym->section->output_section` before calling `ignore_section_sym` in `bfd/elf.c` function `elf_map_symbols()`. The value of `output_section` can be `0x0`.
- **Weakness**: NULL pointer dereference. Specifically, the `ignore_section_sym` function in `elf.c` does not validate the `output_section` pointer in the case of a symtab entry with a "SECTION" type that has a "0" value.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (application crash).
- **Attack vector**: Processing a crafted ELF file with a symtab entry with a "SECTION" type and "0" value using `objcopy`.
- **Required attacker capabilities**: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted ELF file. The user or automated system must be tricked into processing this file.
