Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Mautic tracked contacts using an auto-incremented ID. This predictable sequence allowed an attacker to guess and manipulate tracking cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Session IDs:** The core issue was the use of auto-incremented IDs for tracking contacts, making it easy for attackers to systematically emulate tracking cookies.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting the ability to assume identities of other tracked users, an attacker could use this to retrieve sensitive information about those contacts through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could systematically emulate tracking cookies for different contacts.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  By manipulating cookies, attackers could potentially retrieve personal information of the contact through forms with progressive profiling enabled
*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access to contact information could lead to privacy breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** No authentication or privileges are required.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** Attackers need to be aware of how Mautic tracks contacts.
*   **Ability to manipulate cookies:** Attackers must have the ability to manipulate cookie values.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Mautic version 2.13.0 by switching to unique device IDs for tracking contacts.
*   A related issue exists with the "Identify visitor by tracking url" feature, which, if enabled, can still be exploited. This feature is disabled by default in new Mautic installations but may be enabled on existing ones. Disabling it is recommended.
*  The vulnerability is classified as having a high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5
*  The vulnerability has been assigned the CWE-200 (Information Exposure) designation.
