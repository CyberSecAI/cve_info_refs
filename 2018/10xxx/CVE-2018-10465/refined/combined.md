# Bug Fixes and Enhancements

# Jamf Pro Server

* [PI-003356] Jamf Pro no longer incorrectly displays placeholder text in Settings.
* [PI-003583] Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented Jamf Pro from updating the user and location information for a mobile device assigned to an LDAP user if the LDAP account username and the Jamf Pro account username did not match.
* [PI-004349] Fixed an issue that prevented the scope of a cloned configuration profile from being edited.
* [PI-004444] Fixed an issue that caused Jamf Pro to incorrectly save options other than the ones selected when configuring the Restrictions payload of a mobile device configuration profile.
* [PI-004521] Fixed an issue that incorrectly deployed a mobile device configuration profile with a VPN payload as a "Per-App VPN" VPN type when "F5 SSL" was used for the connection type.
* [PI-004534] Fixed an issue that caused smart groups with the Department criteria selected to display an incorrect number of devices.
* [PI-004723] Fixed an issue that prevented Jamf Pro from displaying correct grammatical gender rules for some objects when viewed in French.
* [PI-004863] Fixed an issue that caused certain mobile device apps to fail to be added to the Jamf Pro App Catalog if the name of the app contained a URL with a large number of characters.
* [PI-004922] Enhanced performance of search lookups for computers and mobile devices.
* [PI-004971] Fixed an issue that caused in-place upgrades to fail on APFS-formated drives due to core storage being enabled.
* [PI-005044] Fixed an issue that resulted in performance issues in Jamf Pro environments with a large number of devices (e.g., 1,000+), including at least one date/time field in the Inventory Display settings.
* [PI-005050] Fixed an issue that caused performance issues in Jamf Pro environments with a large number of devices (e.g., 1,000+) when selecting the Devices tab in the Prestage Enrollments configuration pane with at least one date/time field.
* [PI-005085] Fixed a display issue that prevented the Microsoft Intune Integration payload from being removed once configured.
* [PI-005113] Jamf Pro no longer prevents packages, scripts, printers, or directory bindings from being added or removed using the Configuration settings.
* [PI-005124] Fixed an issue that prevented Jamf Pro from displaying the **Edit Autorun Data** mass action option.
* [PI-005152] Fixed an issue that caused upgrades to fail due to duplicate entries in the Jamf Pro database.
* [PI-005198] Fixed an issue that prevented the pagination settings from displaying when attempting to add a mobile device to the scope of a configuration profile or application if there were more than 100 devices in Jamf Pro.
* [PI-005255] Fixed an issue that caused smart mobile device groups and advanced mobile device searches to return unexpected results for the **Enrollment Method: Enrollment Profile** and **Enrollment Method: User-Initiated - Invitation** fields.
* [PI-005258] Microsoft Intune Integration now works correctly with a multi-context environment.
* [PI-005272] Fixed an issue that caused MDM failures if mobile devices were enrolled in Jamf Pro 10.0.0 or earlier and Jamf Pro was then upgraded to 10.1.0 or 10.1.1.
* [PI-005311] Jamf Pro now automatically appends an identifier to certificates distributed to computers and mobile devices via a configuration profile with a SCEP payload if the **Redistribute Profile** option is configured.
  **Important**: To ensure the configuration profile is redistributed before the SCEP-issued certificate expires, you must manually redistribute the configuration profile to all computers and mobile devices that had the profile installed between Jamf Pro 10.0.0–10.2.x. If the appended identifier is not included in the **Subject** field of the SCEP payload, the profile is not redistributed before the certificate expires. Redistributing the profile to affected devices after upgrading mitigates this issue.
* [PI-005325] Fixed a display issue that prevented the Airplay payload of a mobile device configuration profile from being fully configurable.
* [PI-005357] Fixed an issue that prevented the “Configure SMTP Server” message from displaying on the **Notifications** tab of the Healthcare Listener settings.
* [PI-005358] Fixed an issue that caused the **Delete Selected** button to display on the Building settings page for Jamf Pro user accounts with the "Read Only" privilege.
* [PI-005366] Fixed an issue that prevented communication with Microsoft Intune if a topology change occurred in a clustered environment.
* [PI-005368] Fixed an issue that caused configuration profile information to be stored incorrectly, causing inventory to be inaccurate for some computers.
* [PI-005400] Fixed an issued that caused an in-house app update available in Self Service Mobile to deploy automatically instead of being executed by the end user.
* [PI-005434] Fixed an issue that caused significant performance issues in some environments when MDM requests were sent.
* [PI-005481] Fixed an issue that prevented mobile device inventory updates from completing if multiple copies of an app with a version number that contained a numeric segment with a leading zero (e.g., Google Drive version 4.2018.05202) existed in Jamf Pro and were added to the scope of iOS devices.
* [PI-005559] Fixed an issue that allowed Jamf Pro users to perform a limited set of actions without authorization.
