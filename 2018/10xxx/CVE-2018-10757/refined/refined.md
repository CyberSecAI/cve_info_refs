Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10757

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the authentication mechanism of CSP MySQL User Manager. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input in the login form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the login fields. This occurs because the application directly uses user-supplied data in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the application. In the provided example, the attacker can log in with the username `admin' or '1=1--` and any password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The attack vector is the login form where the username and password fields are vulnerable to SQL injection. The attacker inputs a crafted username in order to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application's login page.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft a suitable payload for the login form.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit example shows how to bypass authentication using `admin' or ' 1=1--` as the username.
- The vulnerability is present in version 2.3.1 of CSP MySQL User Manager.
- A commit on GitHub mentions checking for invalid characters in username and password. While this is related to input validation, it is a separate issue and does not fix the SQL injection vulnerability. The added input validation only checks for alphanumeric characters in username and password, which does not prevent SQL injection attempts.
