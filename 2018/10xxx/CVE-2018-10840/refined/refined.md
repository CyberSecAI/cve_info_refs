{
  "CVE-2018-10840": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow in the fs/ext4/xattr.c:ext4_xattr_set_entry() function. An attacker could exploit this by operating on a mounted crafted ext4 image.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
      "Ubuntu 16.04 ESM",
      "Ubuntu 18.04 ESM"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the `ext4_xattr_set_entry()` function within the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem implementation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient validation of xattr information"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "Mounting a specially crafted ext4 filesystem image.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to mount a malicious ext4 image."
    },
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the kernel attempts to set an extended attribute (xattr) within an ext4 filesystem using a crafted image. This can lead to a buffer overflow on the heap, resulting in a crash or potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution. The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in the Linux Kernel for Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux."
