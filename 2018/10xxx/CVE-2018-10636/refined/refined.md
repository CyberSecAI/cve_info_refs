Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of user input validation when processing project files. Specifically, the software fails to validate the size of data copied from project files to the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The software copies data from project files onto the stack without proper validation of the size of the data, which results in a buffer overflow if the data is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain remote code execution with administrator privileges.
- **Software Crash:** The vulnerability causes the software to crash due to the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by processing malicious project files, which can be delivered over a network.
- The attack requires user interaction, as the user must open a malicious project file in the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker does not need to be physically present at the target machine and can potentially exploit the vulnerability over a network.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes a "low skill level to exploit." This suggests that the vulnerability is easily exploitable.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to get the user to open a malicious file crafted to trigger the overflow.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating high confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.
- The vulnerability affects CNCSoft Version 1.00.83 and prior, and ScreenEditor Version 1.00.54.
- The advisory also mentions a related out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2018-10598) that is separate from the stack-based buffer overflow.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description and provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.
