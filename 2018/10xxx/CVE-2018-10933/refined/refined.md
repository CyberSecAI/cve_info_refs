{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-10933",
  "description": "libssh versions 0.6 and above have an authentication bypass vulnerability in the server code. By presenting the server an SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message in place of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message which the server would expect to initiate authentication, the attacker could successfully authentciate without any credentials.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The libssh server code incorrectly handled authentication by accepting an SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message before proper authentication was performed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to improper handling of authentication messages."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the server, potentially leading to the creation of channels and other actions normally restricted to authenticated users.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message instead of the expected SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable server and send specific SSH messages. No prior authentication or knowledge of user credentials is required."
