## What our customers say about Acronis DeviceLock DLP

* A product like DeviceLock delivers high value for its intended purpose of port and device-level security. My experience with all-in-one solutions is that they do a bit of everything, but none of them very well. With DeviceLock we got features like integration with Microsoft’s Active Directory, so that we could structure deployment around existing groups. I installed it and had it working within a day. We’re always leveraging this interface when we set-up new users and change permissions. We’ve allowed certain IT Support staff the right to manage DeviceLock permission setting for various user groups; but, they cannot make global changes. DeviceLock allows us these conveniences and fine-tuning.  Show more

  Tim Mugherini
   Senior Manager of Network Infrastructure & Security
* DeviceLock has been our chosen endpoint DLP security solution for years, but its compatibility with Lexar JumpDrive SAFE S3000 USB flash drives at both the encryption detection layer and unique device ID number layer with its granular whitelisting features really helps us with many levels of compliance as well as security. No other endpoint solution provides this flexibility of encryption integration.  Show more

  Christopher Long
   CISSP, Chief Security Officer
* DeviceLock was the ideal product for us. I was primarily looking for a solution that required minimal supervision, allowing me to focus on managing our IT estate and supporting our asset managers. DeviceLock was simple to roll out and it was very competitive on cost. We have just renewed our contract and price is naturally an increasingly important consideration in the current environment. Until we purchased DeviceLock, our policy was to disable USB totally. With the advent of newer PCs with only USB mice and keyboards, this was clearly not a sustainable situation.  Show more

  Bruce Paterson
   IT Manager
* Since 2005 the City of London Police have been successfully using Devicelock to manage device security across the enterprise. This has provided central access control for device management and audit control of information being transferred to and from the secure environment onto portable media. Robust monitoring has been developed using Devicelock and this provides me with a high degree of confidence in the security of our information.  Show more

### Frequently asked questions

* ## Can Acronis DeviceLock DLP function without internet connection?

  There are two different sets of DLP policies, Regular and Offline, which are automatically applied to a controlled endpoint by Acronis DeviceLock DLP agents depending on its network status. The Offline policy can be triggered by the laptop using either cached or confirmed Windows credential authentication, whether it can connect to any of its known Acronis DeviceLock Enterprise Servers, or if in a wired vs. unwired state.
* ## Is Acronis DeviceLock DLP capable of “passive mode” functioning, i.e. not restricting data transfer, but logging and shadow copying?

  Yes, Acronis DeviceLock DLP is capable of functioning in any administrator set mode. We also call this “observation mode”.

  In cases where access to ports, devices, or network protocols is not blocked or content-filtered by policy, logging and data shadowing policy can be actively logging and keeping records in audit and shadow logs in “passive mode”.

  If there is a restrictive access policy active, Acronis’ DLP solution blocks the transfer and prevents data leakage on a controlled endpoint in real time.
* ## Is there an option to configure various access control policies for laptops in- and out of the corporate network?

  Yes, there is. Acronis DeviceLock DLP supports various on- and off-corporate-line security policies. This way you can have one policy when the laptop is behind the firewall or DMZ and a totally different policy when the laptop is out in the wild, strengthening DLP security.

DeviceLock Plug and Play Auditor v5.72 (freeware)
DLPnpAuditor.exe
DeviceLock® Plug and Play Auditor is a non-intrusive clientless software solution that generates reports displaying the USB,
FireWire and PCMCIA devices currently connected to computers in the network and those that were connected.
Vulnerability Type:
===================
Unicode Buffer Overflow (SEH)
CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2018-10655
Security Issue:
================
DeviceLock Plug and Play Auditor "DLPnpAuditor.exe" is vulnerable to a Unicode type of buffer overflow, when supplied a specially crafted textfile using the "scan network" from file option.
The buffer overload payload will get converted to unicode character encoding. Unicode support is used by applications for internationalization purposes allowing a consistent way to visually
represent different character sets on most systems around the world.
e.g.
Before our buffer overflow payload was put on the stack it was expanded with 0x00 so "RRRR" transforms to Unicode representation of "00520052"
(52 is HEX for Ascii char R) containing 0's (NULL) values. Therefore, attempting to exploit the vulnerable program needs an unicode compatiable address
(address with null bytes) and using encoding methods like "alpha2" encoder tool.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
