  "CVE-2018-10655": {
    "source_1": {
      "root_cause": "A Unicode buffer overflow vulnerability exists in DeviceLock Plug and Play Auditor when processing a specially crafted text file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unicode Buffer Overflow",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable address with null bytes is used, because the supplied input is converted to unicode.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted text file that is loaded through the 'Scan Network' -> 'From file' option of the application.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted file to the vulnerable application. This is a local attack."

      "impact": "The application's stack can be overwritten, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable unicode-compatible address is used in the exploit payload. The payload is expanded with NULL bytes (0x00) when converted to unicode, requiring special considerations for exploit development.",
       "attack_vectors": "Local attack using a malformed text file that is loaded via the application's 'scan network' -> 'From file' option.",
