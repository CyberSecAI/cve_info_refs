  "CVE-2018-10916": {
    "description": "It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity on the local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working directory of the victim's system.",

      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of remote file names during reverse mirroring operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation of remote file names",
        "Use of attacker-controlled data in file operations"

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control an FTP server and be able to create directories/files with specific names. They must also trick a victim into using `lftp`'s reverse mirroring functionality.",
