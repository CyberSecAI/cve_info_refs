- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `attemptGrant` function in the `Authorization` class uses loose comparison (`==`) instead of strict comparison (`===`) when checking passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This allows for type juggling, where a string representing a number in scientific notation can be considered equal to a numerical string with the same value (e.g., '200' == '2e2' evaluates to true).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the authorization check by providing a password in scientific notation that evaluates to the same value as the actual password, effectively granting access without the correct credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the authentication/authorization process where the password comparison is performed using `==` instead of `===`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to know that the system is using this flawed password verification logic and be able to provide a password that exploits the loose comparison, by providing a valid number represented in a different format (scientific notation)
