# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10887 CVE-2018-10888 CVE-2018-15501

CVE-2018-15501
     A potential out-of-bounds read when processing a "ng" smart packet
     might lead to a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-10887
     A flaw has been discovered that may lead to an integer overflow which
     in turn leads to an out of bound read, allowing to read before the
     base object. This might be used to leak memory addresses or cause a
     Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-10888
     A flaw may lead to an out-of-bound read while reading a binary delta
     file. This might result in a Denial of Service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.21.1-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgit2 packages.

## Description

A flaw was found in libgit2 before version 0.27.3. It has been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in git\_delta\_apply function in delta.c file may lead to an integer overflow which in turn leads to an out of bound read, allowing to read before the base object. An attacker may use this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service.

delta: fix sign-extension of big left-shift

```
Our delta code was originally adapted from JGit, which itself adapted it
from git itself. Due to this heritage, we inherited a bug from git.git
in how we compute the delta offset, which was fixed upstream in
48fb7deb5 (Fix big left-shifts of unsigned char, 2009-06-17). As
explained by Linus:

    Shifting 'unsigned char' or 'unsigned short' left can result in sign
    extension errors, since the C integer promotion rules means that the
    unsigned char/short will get implicitly promoted to a signed 'int' due to
    the shift (or due to other operations).

    This normally doesn't matter, but if you shift things up sufficiently, it
    will now set the sign bit in 'int', and a subsequent cast to a bigger type
    (eg 'long' or 'unsigned long') will now sign-extend the value despite the
    original expression being unsigned.

    One example of this would be something like

            unsigned long size;
            unsigned char c;

            size += c << 24;

    where despite all the variables being unsigned, 'c << 24' ends up being a
    signed entity, and will get sign-extended when then doing the addition in
    an 'unsigned long' type.

    Since git uses 'unsigned char' pointers extensively, we actually have this
    bug in a couple of places.

In our delta code, we inherited such a bogus shift when computing the
offset at which the delta base is to be found. Due to the sign extension
we can end up with an offset where all the bits are set. This can allow
an arbitrary memory read, as the addition in `base_len < off + len` can
now overflow if `off` has all its bits set.

Fix the issue by casting the result of `*delta++ << 24UL` to an unsigned
integer again. Add a test with a crafted delta that would actually
succeed with an out-of-bounds read in case where the cast wouldn't
exist.

This is a security release fixing out-of-bounds reads when reading objects from a packfile. This corresponds to [CVE-2018-10887](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5gcq-g5p3-pjp4 "CVE-2018-10887") and [CVE-2018-10888](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mwfj-cw48-q48m "CVE-2018-10888"), which were both reported by Riccardo Schirone.

When packing objects into a single so-called packfile, objects may not get stored as complete copies but instead as deltas against another object "base". A specially crafted delta object could trigger an integer overflow and thus bypass our input validation, which may result in copying memory before or after the base object into the final deflated object. This may lead to objects containing copies of system memory being written into the object database. As the hash of those objects cannot be easily controlled by the attacker, it is unlikely that any of those objects will be valid and referenced by the commit graph.

Note that the error could also be triggered by the function git\_apply\_\_patch. But as this function is not in use outside of our test suite, it is not a possible attack vector.

```
When checking whether a delta base offset and length fit into the base
we have in memory already, we can trigger an overflow which breaks the
check. This would subsequently result in us reading memory from out of
bounds of the base.

The issue is easily fixed by checking for overflow when adding `off` and
`len`, thus guaranteeting that we are never indexing beyond `base_len`.
This corresponds to the git patch 8960844a7 (check patch_delta bounds
more carefully, 2006-04-07), which adds these overflow checks.

Package        : libgit2
Version        : 0.25.1+really0.24.6-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-8098 CVE-2018-8099 CVE-2018-10887 CVE-2018-10888
                 CVE-2018-15501 CVE-2020-12278 CVE-2020-12279
Debian Bug     : 892961 892962 903508 903509

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libgit2, a low-level Git library,
and are as follows:

CVE-2018-8098

    Integer overflow in the index.c:read_entry() function while
    decompressing a compressed prefix length in libgit2 before
    v0.26.2 allows an attacker to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted repository index file.

CVE-2018-8099

    Incorrect returning of an error code in the index.c:read_entry()
    function leads to a double free in libgit2 before v0.26.2, which
    allows an attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted
    repository index file.

CVE-2018-10887

    It has been discovered that an unexpected sign extension in
    git_delta_apply function in delta-apply.c file may lead to an
    integer overflow which in turn leads to an out of bound read,
    allowing to read before the base object. An attacker may use
    this flaw to leak memory addresses or cause a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-10888

    A missing check in git_delta_apply function in delta-apply.c file,
    may lead to an out-of-bound read while reading a binary delta file.
    An attacker may use this flaw to cause a Denial of Service.

CVE-2018-15501

    In ng_pkt in transports/smart_pkt.c in libgit2, a remote attacker
    can send a crafted smart-protocol "ng" packet that lacks a '\0'
    byte to trigger an out-of-bounds read that leads to DoS.

CVE-2020-12278

    path.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because of NTFS
    Alternate Data Streams. This may allow remote code execution when
    cloning a repository. This issue is similar to CVE-2019-1352.

CVE-2020-12279

    checkout.c mishandles equivalent filenames that exist because of
    NTFS short names. This may allow remote code execution when cloning
    a repository. This issue is similar to CVE-2019-1353.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.25.1+really0.24.6-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgit2 packages.
