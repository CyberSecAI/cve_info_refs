{
  "CVE-2018-10887": {
    "Root cause": "An unexpected sign extension in the `git_delta_apply` function leads to an integer overflow in the bounds check, allowing it to be bypassed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially leak memory addresses or cause a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability occurs when processing delta files, which are used for efficient storage of changes in git repositories.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted delta file to a vulnerable system."
