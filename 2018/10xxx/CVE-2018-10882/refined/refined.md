  "CVE-2018-10882": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 file system. A local user can cause an out-of-bound write in in fs/jbd2/transaction.c code, which can lead to memory corruption. This can mean that the memory can be corrupted to create a denial of service, and a system crash or privilege escalation by unmounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image.",
    "root_cause": "The ext4 filesystem implementation had insufficient checks on inode numbers leading to a crash during unmount if the journal inode is accessed improperly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
        "Insufficient validation of inode numbers",
        "Improper handling of journal inodes",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash) and potentially privilege escalation due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image.",
        "Triggering a specific code path during filesystem unmount."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user must be able to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem image."
