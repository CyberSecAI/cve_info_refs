  "CVE-2018-10881": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-10881",
      "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound access in ext4_get_group_info function, a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds access in the `ext4_get_group_info()` function within the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem when a crafted ext4 image is mounted and operated on.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds access"
      ],
      "Impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service and system crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Requires the ability to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem image.",
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability requires the attacker to have the ability to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem image. While unprivileged users are typically restricted from mounting, there is a possibility a user could be tricked into mounting a malicious image, such as from a USB drive. This vulnerability is considered a low severity risk because it requires mounting a crafted filesystem."
