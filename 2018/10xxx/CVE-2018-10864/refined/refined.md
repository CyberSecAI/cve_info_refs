{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw exists in `redhat-certification` within the `DocumentBase:loadFiltered` function in `documentbase.py`. The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly close XML files after opening them. An attacker can exploit this by providing an existing but invalid XML file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to unclosed files",
        "Improper handling of invalid XML files"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by providing an invalid XML file that is opened but never closed by the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker provides a crafted invalid XML file to the server which triggers the vulnerable `DocumentBase:loadFiltered` code, leading to file handle exhaustion."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to submit an XML file to the server. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
