* Run all software as a user, not as an administrator, to minimize the impact of malicious code on the infected system.
* Use Microsoft AppLocker or other similar whitelisting application to help mitigate risk. Information on using AppLocker with Rockwell Automation products is available at:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/546989> (login required).

* Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed, and user/service account access to shared resources (such as a database) is only granted with a minimum amount of rights as needed.

For more information, please see Rockwell Automation’s knowledgebase advisory number 1073800 on this issue at the following location:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073800> (login required)

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

# Title: RSLinx Classic and FactoryTalk Linx Gateway - Privilege Escalation
# Date: 2017-12-11
# Author: LiquidWorm
# Vendor: Rockwell Automation, Inc.
# Product web page: https://www.rockwellautomation.com
# Affected version: Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic 3.90.01
#                 Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic 3.73.00
#                 Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic 3.72.00
#                 Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic 2.58.00
#                 Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Linx Gateway 3.90.00
# CVE: CVE-2018-10619
# Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)

# Summary:
# The FactoryTalk Linx Gateway adds a Classic OPC DA and OPC UA server
# interface to deliver information collected by FactoryTalk Linx from Logix5000™
# and other Allen-Bradley® controllers to external OPC clients, permitting
# third-party software to coexist with FactoryTalk® software.

# PoC:
The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'dnwhodisp' for Windows deployed as part of RSLinx and FactoryTalk.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to
execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot. If
successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
