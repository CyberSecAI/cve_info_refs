Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10626:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of data authenticity during the update service of the Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345):** The monitor's update service doesn't properly verify the authenticity of uploaded data.
*   **Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format (CWE-257):**  Per-product credentials are stored in a recoverable format within the device, which is related to CVE-2018-10622, and is necessary for the exploitation of the insufficient verification vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker with physical access can obtain per-product credentials.
*   An attacker with the credentials and knowledge of the paired implantable cardiac device can upload invalid data to the Medtronic CareLink network, which could have detrimental effects on patient monitoring and treatment.
*  The credentials can also be used for network authentication and encryption of local data at rest (related to CVE-2018-10622).

**Attack vectors:**
*   Physical access to the Medtronic MyCareLink 24950 Patient Monitor is required to obtain the necessary credentials.
*  The attacker needs to know the per-product credentials along with the identifier of the paired implantable cardiac device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Physical access to the affected device.
*   Ability to extract stored credentials from the device.
*   Knowledge of the paired implantable cardiac device to upload invalid data.
* High level of skill is needed to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory notes that Medtronic has implemented server-side updates to address the vulnerability and is implementing additional measures for data integrity and authenticity.
* Medtronic recommends that users maintain good physical control of the device and only use devices obtained directly from healthcare providers.
* NCCIC recommends minimizing network exposure for all medical devices, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet, and to verify file integrity before uploading.
* The document notes that no known public exploits specifically target the vulnerability.
* The affected products are: 24950 MyCareLink Monitor (all versions) and 24952 MyCareLink Monitor (all versions)
