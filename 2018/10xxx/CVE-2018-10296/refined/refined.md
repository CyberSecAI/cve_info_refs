Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the MiniCMS application when handling user-submitted content for articles. Specifically, the title and content fields are vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user input for the article title and content fields before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate or encode the user-provided title or content fields, making it susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can inject JavaScript that extracts session cookies from users who view the malicious article.
*   **Account Hijacking:** With stolen session cookies, an attacker can potentially impersonate other users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the MiniCMS application via the article creation/edit form located at `/mc-admin/post-edit.php`.
*   **Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `"/><script>confirm(document.cookie)</script>`, into the article title and content fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs access to the administrative panel of the MiniCMS application to create or edit articles.
*   **Knowledge of XSS Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a JavaScript payload that can be executed in the browser of a victim.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided content contains a detailed example of how to reproduce the vulnerability, including a specific payload and the affected POST request.
* The attacker needs to publish the malicious article to make it available to potential victims.
* The provided content contains more detail than the typical CVE description.
