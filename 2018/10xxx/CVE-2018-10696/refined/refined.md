{
  "CVE-2018-10696": {
    "root_cause": "The web interface of the Moxa AWK-3121 device is not protected against CSRF attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick an administrator into executing actions without their knowledge, including changing device settings and potentially achieving code execution or privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trick an administrator of the device to visit an attacker-controlled page while connected to the network. This allows the attacker to force the admin's browser to make requests to the device's web interface, thereby executing malicious actions.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page, and the targeted administrator needs to be connected to the same network as the device and be logged into the device's web interface. The attacker then needs to trick the admin into visiting the malicious page."
