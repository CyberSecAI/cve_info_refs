**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The root cause is a flaw in the KVM hypervisor's emulation of certain x86 instructions (such as `sgdt`, `sidt`, `fxsave`, and `fxrstor`). The hypervisor did not check the current privilege level (CPL) of the guest while emulating these instructions, specifically when the instructions are unprivileged.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The KVM hypervisor lacked the proper privilege level check during the emulation of specific x86 instructions. This allowed an unprivileged process in the guest to bypass restrictions intended to isolate the kernel and potentially modify hypervisor state, leading to a use-after-free memory issue.
    *  **Use-After-Free:** Due to lack of privilege check in KVM, this flaw led to memory corruption and use-after-free condition while draining the outstanding command queue

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user or process within a guest VM could potentially escalate privileges inside the guest.
     *   **Information Disclosure**: An attacker could use this flaw to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access and also read sensitive data from kernel or other tasks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could potentially lead to a system crash or memory corruption within the guest OS, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to memory corruption inside the guest OS.
    *  **Potential Code Execution**: It is also mentioned that the flaw can be used for potential code execution, though not directly elaborated.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local:** The attack is local, meaning it requires the attacker to have a presence within the guest VM to exploit it.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unprivileged User in Guest VM:** The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user or process inside a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable KVM hypervisor.
    *   **Ability to execute instructions:** The attacker must have the ability to execute instructions that can trigger the vulnerability in KVM.

**3. Additional Technical Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   **Specific Instructions:** The vulnerability involves specific x86 instructions like `sgdt`, `sidt`, `fxsave`, and `fxrstor`.
*  **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel KVM hypervisor before 4.18 (per CVE description) , fixed in version 4.18.7 (per OpenSUSE fix advisory). This is addressed in Red Hat kernels 3.10.0-1025.el7, 3.12.74-60.64.96.1, 4.4.121-92.85.1 and higher version
*   **Fix:** The fix involves modifying KVM's emulation code to perform a privilege check, ensuring that the instructions are handled correctly according to the current privilege level. The fix is implemented with `segmented_write_std` function that determines whether the access is a "system" access or should use the processor's CPL, and also adding a `system` boolean to the read\_std/write\_std calls.

**5. Summary of Findings**

The analyzed content indicates that CVE-2018-10853 is a significant security vulnerability related to the KVM hypervisor within the Linux kernel. The root cause is the lack of privilege check for emulated instructions, which allows for privilege escalation, memory corruption, information leaks, and potentially arbitrary code execution inside the guest. The attack vector is local to the guest VM, requiring an unprivileged user to be present to trigger the vulnerability. Patches were introduced to mitigate the vulnerability by adding privilege level checks, and these have been rolled out to multiple distros and versions, including RHEL and OpenSUSE.
