Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10063

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when exporting form submission data to a CSV file. Specifically, the application does not sanitize characters that could be interpreted as spreadsheet formulas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The primary vulnerability is CSV injection. This occurs because the application doesn't sanitize special characters like "=", "+", "-", or "@" when exporting data to CSV. When a user opens the CSV file with a spreadsheet program, these characters trigger formula execution.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user input before including it in a CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** A malicious actor can inject commands within form fields. When a privileged user exports the form data to a CSV file and opens it, the injected commands execute on the user's machine, leading to potential remote command execution.
- For example, an attacker could inject the payload `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`, which would cause the calculator application to open on the victim's machine when the CSV is opened using a spreadsheet software.
- **Data Manipulation/Compromise:** Attackers could potentially manipulate data, access or compromise the user's system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Submission:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through a form field on the web application.
- **CSV Export:** A privileged user must then export the form submission data to CSV using the application.
- **CSV Opening:** The privileged user opens the generated CSV file using a spreadsheet application, which triggers the execution of the injected formulas.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data via a public-facing form.
- The attacker does not need any privileged access to the application itself.
- The attack requires a privileged user to export and open the CSV file, so the attacker needs to rely on that user's actions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Joomla! Convert Forms version 2.0.3 and earlier.
- The fix implemented in version 2.0.4 involves prefixing values in the CSV file with a tab character if they start with "=", "+", "-", or "@".
- The component's configuration allows administrators to disable this sanitization feature, but it is enabled by default in the fixed versions.
