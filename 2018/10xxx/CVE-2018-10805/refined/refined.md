Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ReadYCBCRImage` function within ImageMagick.
- A memory leak occurs due to improper resource management. Specifically, if `AcquireQuantumInfo` fails, the allocated `canvas_image` memory is not freed, leading to a leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is a memory leak. The code allocates memory for `canvas_image` using `CloneImage` but doesn't free this memory if `AcquireQuantumInfo` returns NULL, leading to a leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation of this memory leak could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `ReadYCBCRImage`
- This could be triggered by a user or automated system processing the crafted image with ImageMagick

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a system utilizing ImageMagick to process images.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, just the ability to supply a malicious image for processing.
- The attacker does not need any access to the system itself, only to the processing function through file upload or other methods.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided code snippet highlights the exact location of the memory leak. The `canvas_image` is allocated on line 170, but not released if `AcquireQuantumInfo` fails on line 178, leading to memory leak.
- The issue was reported against ImageMagick version 7.0.7-28
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a `DestroyImage(canvas_image);` before returning when the allocation for quantum_info fails.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided information is directly related to CVE-2018-10805 as it describes a memory leak vulnerability in ImageMagick, which is also referenced in the Ubuntu security notice.
