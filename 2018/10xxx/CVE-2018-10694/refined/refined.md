Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10694:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Moxa AWK-3121 device, by default, establishes an open Wi-Fi connection without any encryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of Wi-Fi encryption by default
- Insecure communication channel
- Default open wifi network

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can sniff network traffic, potentially intercepting sensitive data such as HTTP credentials and TELNET traffic.
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker can intercept and modify traffic, potentially infecting a user's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of the device's Wi-Fi signal to monitor the wireless channels and capture traffic
- Use of tools like Kismet and a wireless card in monitor mode to sniff traffic on the open Wi-Fi network

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range of the Moxa AWK-3121 device.
- Attacker needs a wireless card capable of monitor mode and packet sniffing tools.
