  "CVE-2018-10531": {
    "relevancy": "related",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The America's Army Proving Grounds game server, using the Unreal Engine, responds to unauthenticated UDP packets with a larger response, allowing for DDoS amplification.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "DDoS Amplification",
         "Unauthenticated UDP Protocol"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to perform DDoS attacks, causing congestion and denial of service on target networks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a small unauthenticated UDP packet to vulnerable game servers."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets and spoof the source IP address.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability was discovered during traffic analysis of a CDN. The game servers respond to the crafted UDP packets with a larger response, which allows the attacker to amplify the traffic and cause network congestion. A proof-of-concept exploit checker written in perl was provided."
