    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-10683",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in WildFly where the HTTP interface is defined without a security realm reference, resulting in unauthenticated access to the management console.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unprotected anonymous access to the management interface (CWE-732)",
        "Default configuration allowing anonymous users administrative privileges"

      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the WildFly server on port 9990.",
          "Accessing the management console via the HTTP interface at http://target.com:9990/console/",
          "Exploiting the default auto-deployment feature by uploading a malicious .war file via the deployments tab."

      "required_capabilities": [
        "Network connectivity to the target WildFly server.",
        "Ability to perform HTTP requests.",
