CVE-2018-10242

    Missing length check causing out-of-bounds read in SSHParseBanner
    (app-layer-ssh.c). Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability
    to cause DoS or potentially unauthorized disclosure of information.
```

- **Vulnerability:** Missing length check in `SSHParseBanner` function within `app-layer-ssh.c` leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Root Cause:** The code lacks proper validation of the length of the SSH banner, allowing it to read beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers.
- **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially unauthorized disclosure of information.
