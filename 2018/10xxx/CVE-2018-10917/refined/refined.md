The vulnerability exists in pulp 2.16.x and potentially older versions.  Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) is not directly affected, but a user could still be tricked into running pulp commands to trigger the vulnerability on the Red Hat Update Appliance (RHUA). Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is not affected by this flaw."
