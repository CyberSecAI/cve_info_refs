Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection found in the ELO Access Manager component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the HTTP GET parameter "ticket".
- The application does not properly sanitize user input within the "ticket" parameter, allowing injection of SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read all database content.
- Specifically, the attacker can read sensitive data such as password hashes from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/wf-NAME/social/api/feed/aggregation/` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `ticket` parameter, which allows injection of SQL statements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote (AV:N) and does not require any authentication (Au:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected ELO system.
- No special capabilities or privileges are needed.
- The attacker needs to be able to observe the time it takes for the server to respond to determine if the injection was successful and infer data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects ELOenterprise 10, ELOenterprise 9, ELOprofessional 10, and ELOprofessional 9.
- The vulnerable versions are ELO Access Manager <= 9.17.120 and <= 10.17.120.
- The proof of concept demonstrates how to use a `WAITFOR DELAY` statement to cause a time delay if a specific character in a database name is greater than 104. This allows the attacker to infer the database name character by character.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to versions 9.18.040 or 10.18.040.
