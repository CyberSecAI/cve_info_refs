The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) <= 2.2.7. Specifically, this section relates to CVE-2018-10516:

**Vulnerability:** CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) <= 2.2.7 "file rename" operation in the admin dashboard contains sensitive information disclosure vulnerability that can cause DOS(admin user)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and validation of the file names during the "file rename" operation. Specifically, the `$oldname` parameter, which is the file to be renamed, is decoded using base64decode but not filtered or validated for path traversal sequences like `..`. This allows an attacker to rename files to arbitrary locations, including outside of the intended file directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  *   **Path Traversal:** The lack of proper filtering on the base64 decoded filename allows the user to specify paths outside of the intended directory.
  *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The file rename functionality doesn't prevent moving sensitive files like `config.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can move critical files (e.g. `config.php`) to other locations making the website inaccessible.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Moving the config.php file exposes sensitive configuration information like database credentials, albeit by effectively taking the website offline.

**Attack Vectors:**
*  The attacker must have administrator access.
*  The attacker exploits the file rename function via crafted HTTP requests using a tool like Burp Suite, manipulating parameters to rename the files and move them outside of the intended directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in administrator user in the CMSMS admin dashboard.
*   The attacker must have the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g. using a proxy like Burp Suite)
