  "cveId": "CVE-2018-10507",
  "description": "TrendMicro OfficeScan XG v11.0 is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation. An attacker with local access can bypass the antivirus protection feature, which prevents unauthorized changes, such as killing protected OfficeScan XG processes (e.g., 'PccNTMon.exe'). This is achieved by manipulating the 'TMBMServer' service configuration.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of the TMBMServer service configuration, allowing a local attacker to modify its settings and execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control on service configuration",
      "Improper privilege handling",
      "Bypass of change prevention mechanisms"
     ],
    "impact": "Attackers or malware with local access can bypass the antivirus protection feature, kill protected OfficeScan XG processes, and potentially gain further control over the system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected endpoint.",
     "attackVectors": [
       "Local access to the system running Trend Micro OfficeScan XG."
      ],
    "attackerCapabilities": [
      "Requires administrative privileges on the local system."
    ],
  "poc": [
        "1) net user hacker abc123 /add",
        "2) sc.exe config \"TMBMServer\" obj= \".\\hacker\" password= \"pwnage\"",
        "3) net user hacker /delete",
        "4) shutdown /r"
    ]
