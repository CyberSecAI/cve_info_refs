Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10353:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation when parsing the `username` parameter within the `formChangePass` class of Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway. Specifically, user-supplied strings are not properly sanitized before being used to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `username` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database. The attacker can potentially access data beyond what they are authorized to see.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Authentication Required, But Bypassed:**  Although the vulnerability requires authentication to be exploited, the provided advisory mentions that the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed, potentially making the attack easier to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway instance.
*   **Bypass Authentication:** Although authentication is required, there is a mechanism to bypass it, according to the advisory. This reduces the required attacker capabilities.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities" to disclose information.
* Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
