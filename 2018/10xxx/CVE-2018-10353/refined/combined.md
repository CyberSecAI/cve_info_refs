| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the formChangePass class.

An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to disclose sensitive information under the context of the database. |
