{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the `WriteTIFFImage` function of ImageMagick when a specific condition is met while handling high dynamic range images.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak: The `quantum_info` allocated with `AcquireQuantumInfo` is not released when `SetQuantumFormat` fails causing a memory leak."
    ],
    "impact": "A memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion and potentially denial of service if exploited repeatedly.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image. An attacker needs to supply a malformed image to an application using ImageMagick that will cause execution to reach the vulnerable code block.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image to a system that processes it using ImageMagick."
  },
  "additional_notes": "This issue was reported by the ADLab of Venustech."
