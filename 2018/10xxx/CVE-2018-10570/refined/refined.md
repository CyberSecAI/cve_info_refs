- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `install/index.php` file. Specifically, the `admin_username` parameter within the `config` POST request is not filtered for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the application and executed when a user views the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/install/index.php` with a crafted `config[admin_username]` parameter containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/install/index.php` file and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter to inject the malicious payload.
