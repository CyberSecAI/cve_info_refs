  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-10213",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of HTML in invitation emails, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the victim views the crafted email. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "The attack vector is an invitation email where the sender can modify the HTML content before sending."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs an account within the Vaultize system to send invitation emails to other users."
    },
        {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2018-10212",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is improper authorization, allowing users to create folders within another user's account by manipulating the device value.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Authorization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially create arbitrary folders within other user accounts, leading to data disorganization and potential data exposure.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "The attack vector involves modifying the 'device' value during folder creation requests."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an authenticated account within the Vaultize system to exploit this vulnerability."
    },
    {
          "cve_id": "CVE-2018-15631",
          "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the Odoo Discussion module where authorization checks are missing when sending email notifications with attachments, allowing users to access documents they are not authorized to see.",
          "weaknesses": [
              "Missing Authorization Checks",
              "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
          ],
           "impact": "An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to attachments by exploiting the email notification feature. The impact is high because sensitive documents could be exposed to users who should not have access to them.",
           "attack_vectors": [
            "An attacker can exploit the missing authorization by leveraging the email sending feature in the public channel of the Discussion module. This feature sends message attachments via email to all channel participants, without checking access permissions."
           ],
          "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires a valid user account on the Odoo system, with access to the discussion module."
        },
    {
          "cve_id": "CVE-2018-10211",
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper authorization when listing the history of another user via the URL, allowing an unauthorized user to access the history of other users.",
          "weaknesses": [
              "Improper Authorization",
               "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
          ],
         "impact": "An attacker could view the history of other users' activities, leading to a potential privacy violation and information disclosure.",
          "attack_vectors": [
                "The attack vector involves manipulating the URL to access the history of another user."
