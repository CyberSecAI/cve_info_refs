Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by memory leaks within the `container_setup_modules` and `hyper_rescan_scsi` functions in the `container.c` file of `hyperstart` version 1.0.0, specifically in the context of HyperHQ Hyper used with runV 1.0.0 for Docker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak (CWE-772):** The core issue is a failure to free allocated memory within the mentioned functions when creating a new container and during SCSI bus rescanning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The memory leaks can lead to the exhaustion of the virtual machine's memory over time, especially with repeated container creation/deletion.
*   **Availability Impact:** The exhaustion of memory can cause instability and eventually lead to the denial of service for the affected virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (as per CVSS), since the vulnerability is triggered by actions related to container creation and management within a networked environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** According to CVSS, no privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **No user interaction required:** No user interaction is necessary to trigger the vulnerability as well.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create new containers or cause a rescan of the SCSI bus within the affected environment. This could be through direct container creation commands or an automated process that involves these actions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub pull request ([hyperhq/hyperstart#350](https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperstart/pull/350)) addresses the memory leaks.
*   A discussion on the pull request suggests the vulnerability might be limited to affecting a single VM and might not be easily exploitable for a wide-scale DoS, since the memory leak happens on a per VM basis for module setup and once per new container for the SCSI scan.
*   The CVE was assigned even though the immediate impact of the exploitability is limited.
