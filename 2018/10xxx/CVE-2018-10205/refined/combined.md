# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Can someone ([@keloyang](https://github.com/keloyang), [@bergwolf](https://github.com/bergwolf)) confirm this is exploitable to conduct a DoS? I ask because [CVE-2018-10205](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p38x-vhph-j2vp "CVE-2018-10205") was assigned to this issue, but there is no indication it is a vulnerability. Thanks! |

| [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg) No, I don't think one can use the issue to create a DoS. For one thing, it only affects one VM. For another thing, it only happens once per VM to set up the kernel modules, and once per new container to scan the scsi bus. |
