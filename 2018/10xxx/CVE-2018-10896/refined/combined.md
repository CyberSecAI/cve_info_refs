| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-06 15:05:24 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-06 15:05:29 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1598831,1598832  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-07-10 23:38:36 UTC  ``` Garrett,  Apparently this change was introduced in 2011, which is prior to any cloud-init bugs tracked in bz.  Do you happen to remember why ssh_deletekeys was disabled?  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/cloud-init/c/87f3319>  Conjecture on [bug 1574338](show_bug.cgi?id=1574338 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10896 cloud-init: default configuration disabled deletion of SSH host keys [rhel-7]") suggests moving the responsibility to systemd/ssh-keygen.service, but that doesn't seem clearly linked in the Fedora package tree.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c3)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:20:10 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c4)  Ben Cotton    2019-10-31 18:54:05 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 29 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 29 on 2019-11-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '29'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 29 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1598832#c5)  Ben Cotton    2019-11-27 23:19:18 UTC  ``` Fedora 29 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2019-11-26. Fedora 29 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1574338#c0)  Khramov Anton    2018-05-03 05:36:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  in combination with hashicorp packer and cloud-init, SSH host keys are not regenerated, when new VM instances are created. This could lead to the MITM attack.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  0.7.9  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a simple rhel7 image using packer 2. Create instances using this image 3. Notice that all these images share the same SSH host keys  Actual results:  SSH keys are not regenerated when new instance is created  Expected results:  SSH keys should be regenerated  Additional info:  When cloud-init was created for rhel, the "ssh_deletekeys" option was explicitly set to "false" and "ssh_genkeytypes" option was set to be empty ([https://git.centos.org/blob/rpms!cloud-init.git/c7/SOURCES!0001-configuration-changes-for-RHEL-package.patch#L66](https://git.centos.org/blob/rpms%21cloud-init.git/c7/SOURCES%210001-configuration-changes-for-RHEL-package.patch#L66)). Most probably it was done because "cloud-init.service" has "Wants=sshd-keygen.service" (<https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/blob/master/systemd/cloud-init.service.tmpl#L6>), which actually is responsible to regenerate ssh keys ([https://git.centos.org/blob/rpms!openssh.git/c7/SOURCES!sshd-keygen.service](https://git.centos.org/blob/rpms%21openssh.git/c7/SOURCES%21sshd-keygen.service)). However "sshd-keygen.service" doesn't have a logic to detect whether current VM instance was just created or not. "cloud-init" has this logic.  Other distors, like SLES or Ubuntu, both rely on cloud-init logic, but not on "sshd-keygen.service" to regenerate SSH host keys.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1574338#c24)  Huijuan Zhao    2020-03-24 10:56:30 UTC  ``` Tested with rhel-7.9(3.10.0-1128.el7.x86_64) + cloud-init-19.4-2.el7.x86_64, the issue is fixed.  1. There's "ssh_deletekeys:   1" and "ssh_genkeytypes:  ~" in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg. 2. Compare the content of /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*key* between VM1 and image: The content are different between VM1 and image.  SSH host keys are regenerated for the new instance.  Change the status to VERIFIED.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1574338#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-29 19:48:41 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory (Moderate: cloud-init security, bug fix, and enhancement update), and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.

# cloud.cfg.tmpl should not include "ssh\_deletekeys: 0"

Bug #1781094 reported by
[Doran Moppert](https://launchpad.net/~dmoppert)
on 2018-07-11

### Bug Description

It seems that cloud-init inherited from Fedora the inclusion of "ssh\_deletekeys: 0" in cloud.cfg.tmpl (commit 41d46bfb85). This is risky in orchestration environments where an instance might be used as a master or template, and cloned from without other tools removing SSH host keys. We believe that line should be removed from cloud.cfg.tmpl to reduce the risk of it being used in such environments.

CVE-2018-10896 has been assigned [1]. On the Fedora bug [2] we are looking into history.

I'll fix the upstream config/cloud.cfg.tmpl to not include 'ssh\_deletekeys: 0'.

Is there anything else expected there?

FWIW, this is from cloud-init commit:

 <https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/?id=7fc73a8d55857>

which references that it came from fedora packaging commit
