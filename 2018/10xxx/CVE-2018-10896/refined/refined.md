Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a default configuration in `cloud-init` where the `ssh_deletekeys` option was set to `0` (or false). This setting disabled `cloud-init`'s mechanism for deleting and regenerating SSH host keys upon the first boot of a new instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Disabled SSH Host Key Regeneration:** The primary weakness is that `cloud-init` was not deleting and regenerating SSH host keys.
- **Shared SSH Host Keys:** When virtual machines or cloud instances are cloned from a base image or template without regenerating SSH host keys, multiple instances end up sharing the same keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker could potentially perform a MITM attack because they could intercept traffic from machines sharing the same host keys.
- **Impersonation:** Instances could impersonate each other due to having the same SSH host keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cloning/Copying Virtual Machines/Instances:** Creating new instances from a base image or template where `ssh_deletekeys` was set to false, causing them to share the same SSH keys.
- **Orchestration Environments:** The issue is particularly risky in orchestration environments where instances are created by cloning a template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between instances sharing the same SSH keys.
- They could potentially be an internal attacker with access to the same network as vulnerable instances.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was introduced in a Fedora packaging commit that set the `ssh_deletekeys` option to `0`.
- The fix involves removing the `ssh_deletekeys: 0` line from the default `cloud.cfg.tmpl` file.
- The vulnerability affected multiple distributions including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu
- Upstream fix was merged in cloud-init commit e218c597.
- This issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8 and 8.2 Extended Update Support via RHSA-2020:3898, RHSA-2020:3050 and RHSA-2020:3644 respectively.
