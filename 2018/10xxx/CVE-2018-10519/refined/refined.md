{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way CMSMS handles user authentication and privilege escalation. Specifically, the `eff_uid` value in the user's cookie can be manipulated to impersonate an administrator. This is made possible due to the predictable way the login key and salt are generated, coupled with the lack of proper validation of the cached data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable generation of the login key and salt",
      "Direct access to cached files in the /tmp directory via web",
      "Lack of proper validation of the cached login data",
	  "Insufficient input validation",
	  "Lack of proper access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An ordinary user can escalate their privileges to an administrator, gaining full control over the CMSMS installation.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious cookie containing a manipulated `eff_uid` and bypassing the data integrity checks, an attacker can achieve privilege escalation through a web request.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs an ordinary user account on the CMSMS admin dashboard. They must also be able to craft HTTP requests and have knowledge of the system to forge a valid cookie, and thus become an admin user."
