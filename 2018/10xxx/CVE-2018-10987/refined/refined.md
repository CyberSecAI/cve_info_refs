{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the REQUEST_SET_WIFIPASSWD function (UDP command 153) of the Diqee360 vacuum cleaner, where a crafted UDP packet executes `/mnt/skyeye/mode_switch.sh %s` with the attacker controlling the `%s` variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote code execution vulnerability due to command injection in the `mode_switch.sh` script. The system executes attacker-controlled data as part of the command.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary system command execution with root privileges, potentially gaining full control of the affected vacuum cleaner.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the vacuum cleaner.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be authenticated to the device, and know the device's UID. Authentication can be achieved using the default admin password of '888888'."
