Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the content section of blog pages. Specifically, the Monstra CMS allows an editor-role user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the content section of a new blog page. This injected code is then executed when a user visits the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is permanently stored within the application's database (or file system) and is executed whenever a user accesses the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal cookies, which can lead to session hijacking and impersonation of the victim.
- **Account Compromise:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker can potentially compromise the entire CMS.
- **Malware Distribution:**  The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites or deliver malware.
- **Data Theft:** If successful, the attacker can also access or modify sensitive data.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker may also modify the content of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Monstra CMS.
- **Blog Content Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious script into the content section of a blog page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Editor Role Access:** The attacker needs to have an editor role or similar access within the Monstra CMS.
- **Content Creation Privilege:** They need the privilege to create new blog pages and manipulate their content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Monstra CMS version 3.0.4.
- The exploit code examples include `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` and `<img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/) >` as payloads to demonstrate the XSS.
- The vulnerability is in the content section of a blog page, not the title section, differentiating it from a related issue #427.
- All users, including administrators, editors, and guests, are affected if they visit the page containing the malicious code.
