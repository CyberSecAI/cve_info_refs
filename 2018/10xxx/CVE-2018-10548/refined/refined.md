{
  "CVE-2018-10548": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from mishandling of the `ldap_get_dn` return value in `ext/ldap/ldap.c`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote LDAP server can cause a denial of service (application crash) on the PHP application.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious remote LDAP server can send a crafted response.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious LDAP server that is connected to a vulnerable PHP application."
  },
  "CVE-2018-10546": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop within the `ext/iconv/iconv.c` file. Specifically, the `iconv` stream filter doesn't properly reject invalid multibyte sequences, causing the loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Infinite loop"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger an infinite loop, causing a denial-of-service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing invalid multibyte sequences to the iconv stream filter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the input processed by the iconv stream filter in the vulnerable PHP application."
  },
    "CVE-2018-10549": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `exif_iif_add_value` function within `ext/exif/exif.c`. This occurs due to the mishandling of a MakerNote that lacks a final null character when processing crafted JPEG data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service (application crash) by providing a crafted JPEG file.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted JPEG file is processed using the `exif_read_data` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted JPEG image to the vulnerable PHP application."
   },
  "CVE-2018-17082": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a mishandling of the bucket brigade in the php_handler function within `sapi/apache2handler/sapi_apache2.c` when processing chunked transfer-encoding requests.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can inject malicious code into the HTTP response, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the attacker can control the content of the response displayed to the user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with chunked transfer-encoding to a vulnerable PHP application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP application."
  },
  "CVE-2019-9637": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the implementation of the `rename()` function across filesystems in PHP. Due to the way permissions are managed during the rename process, the file being renamed is briefly accessible with incorrect permissions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect file permission handling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthorized user may gain access to a file's data during the brief period it exists with incorrect permissions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the rename() function is used to move a file across different filesystems.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `rename()` operation and be positioned where they can access the file with the brief incorrect permissions."
  },
    "CVE-2019-9022": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how PHP parses DNS responses, specifically when handling DNS\_CAA and DNS\_ANY queries within `php_parserr` in `ext/standard/dns.c`.  A malformed DNS response can cause PHP to misuse `memcpy`, leading to read operations beyond the allocated buffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious DNS server can potentially cause a denial-of-service by sending a specially crafted response that leads to a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when PHP attempts to process a malformed DNS response from a compromised or malicious DNS server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious DNS server that is queried by a vulnerable PHP application."
