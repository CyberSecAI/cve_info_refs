# CVE-2018-10959 - BeyondTrust - Untrusted Search Path

April 17th, 2019

[Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-10959) and [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10959) have recently made this 7.5 high severity CVE public, describing the vulnerability as an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability, exploitable by modifying environment variables to trigger automatic elevation of an attacker’s process launch.

The exact words within the CVE are:

> Avecto Defendpoint 4 prior to 4.4 SR6 and 5 prior to 5.1 SR1 has an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability, exploitable by modifying environment variables to trigger automatic elevation of an attacker’s process launch.

Avecto has also identified this CVE in its release notes, which can be found [here](https://www.beyondtrust.com/docs/release-notes/privilege-management/windows-and-mac/windows/pm-windows-4-4-sr6.pdf). They describe the fix as:

> Added a check to ensure computer level environment variables cannot be overridden by user-defined environment variables.

However, neither of these descriptions provide enough detail to completely understand the vulnerability. Now that the nondisclosure window has passed and the CVE is publicly known, I would like to describe this vulnerability and exploit in more detail.

### Avecto Privilege Guard

Avecto Privilege Guard is software used for endpoint privilege management. A common use case for this software is the scenario when a standard user needs limited administrative permissions. Rather than making the user an administrator, this software watches for programs to be executed, and if they match the configuration rules, automatically injects administrative permissions into the process’s security token.

Various rules and conditions can be used to identify which programs get this special treatment. Examples include file path, file name, trusted files (only files owned by administrators or SYSTEM), and digital signatures.

For this exploit, all rules that depend on the file path and include an environment variable as part of the path are vulnerable. For example, the following rule is vulnerable:

```
<AddAdmin>
	<Rule FilePath="%ProgramFiles%\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe" />
</AddAdmin>

```

In this rule, whenever a standard user launches Wireshark, it would automatically be elevated by Avecto.

It should also be noted that the Avecto Management Console, which is a GUI front end for creating the rules file, automatically injects some System environment variables into paths when possible. Therefore, any rule that includes a file path of c:\Program Files is automatically converted to use the vulnerable %ProgramFiles% instead.

### Environment Variables

There are two types of Windows environment variables: User and System. User environment variables only apply to the current user logged in. System environment variables apply to all users of the computer. Windows has some default well-known System environment variables such as %SystemDrive%, %WinDir%, and %ProgramFiles% that typically resolve to C:, C:\Windows, and C:\Program Files respectively.

In the default scenario, when a System environment variable and User environment variable exist with identical names, the User environment variable takes precedence when referenced. It is due to this precedence ordering that this vulnerability exists.

### Exploit

Now it is time to exploit that Wireshark rule!

On the computer with this Wireshark rule in effect, %ProgramFiles% resolves to C:\Program Files. This means that when the standard user launches C:\Program Files\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe, this rule is matched and the process gets the administrator token injected by Avecto. This is the expected result.

To exploit as a standard user we need to create a User environment variable that matches. To do this, we launch a cmd prompt and run the following command:

```
setx ProgramFiles c:\Users\<StandardUser>\Desktop

```

This creates a user environment variable called ProgramFiles that points to an attacker’s writable folder.

Next, the rule file path directory is matched by creating a folder called Wireshark on the Desktop.

Finally, the attacker’s code is dropped into this folder and renamed to Wireshark.exe.

Now when the attacker’s code is launched, Avecto matches the rule to the attacker’s code and it automatically gives administrative permissions to the process launch. We have just exploited a Privilege Escalation vulnerability as any standard user can now launch any code with administrative permissions without needing to enter administrator credentials. From this point it is trivial to elevate to SYSTEM, giving complete ownership of the computer to the attacker.

### The Fix

As described in the release notes, the fix was fairly simple. Instead of using User environment variables before System environment variables when resolving rule file paths, the ordering has been switched. Now any standard Windows environment variables referenced in the rule file paths will always resolve to the correct System environment variable.

Chapter 1 - Release Notes

For this release, Microsoft Office 2016 should be at version 16.0.6001.1038 or later. Please see Avecto KB
article https://connect.avecto.com/community/articles/en_US/Support_KB_Article/Required-Microsoft-

l New Features detailed below

l Bug Fixes detailed below

You need to restart all endpoints managed by Defendpoint after upgrading to this version of Defendpoint to
ensure policy is correctly applied.

1.1 - New Features
72507 - Added support for Trusted Application Protection (TAP) DLL audit events for endpoints being managed by
iC3 version 2.0 and above. The following TAP DLL audit events are now sent to iC3 2.0 and above from the
endpoint:
706 - Passive Event
716 - Blocked
720 - Canceled

1.2 - Bug Fixes
77416 - Hardened the security for the Defendpoint hook load mechanism by removing the reliance on global
mutexes. This does not affect the management of, or the user experience of, Defendpoint. This addresses CVE-
2017-16245.

75951 - Hardened security by migrating the Defendpoint Application Control feature from user mode to kernel
mode. This does not affect the management of, or the user experience of, Defendpoint. This addresses CVE-2017-
16246.

54821 - Added support for Swedish in the on-demand options to 'Run as' and 'Run as administrator'.

72106, 72539, 74152 - Application rules are now correctly applied when an application is run from a network path.

73972 - Anti-tamper has been improved to protect the Defendpoint client from a WMIC uninstall.

76474 - All events are now correctly forwarded and displayed in iC3 irrespective of time-zone.

80880 - Improved the reliability of command line parsing for batch files. As part of this change we have hardened
our approach to matching for batch files. When using the 'start' command line switch, Defendpoint does not match
any rules for subsequent batch files. This is in line with the existing '\K' command line switch functionality.

81499 - Added a check to ensure computer level environment variables cannot be overridden by user defined
environment variables. This addresses CVE-2018-10959 reported by the Lockheed Martin Red Team.

a file from the browser:

l Files that are compressed in a zip file. The zip file itself is tagged with the Avecto Zone Identifier tag.

l Files that are downloaded directly to a mapped network drive. The Avecto Zone Identifier tag is applied

when you save the file to your local drive first before moving it to a mapped network drive.

This means that you cannot match on the Avecto Zone Identifier tag in the above scenarios.
