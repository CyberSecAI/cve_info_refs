{
  "cve": "CVE-2018-10959",
  "affected_product": "Avecto Defendpoint 4 prior to 4.4 SR6 and 5 prior to 5.1 SR1",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Avecto Defendpoint resolved file paths in its rules, specifically when those paths contained environment variables. It incorrectly prioritized user-defined environment variables over system-level variables when evaluating rules, allowing a standard user to manipulate the environment variables to point to a malicious executable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Untrusted Search Path vulnerability",
      "Incorrect precedence of User over System environment variables"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation. An attacker with standard user privileges could gain administrative or SYSTEM level privileges by exploiting this vulnerability, allowing arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Modifying user-level environment variables",
      "Creating a malicious executable in a path controlled by the user's modified environment variable"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A standard user can exploit this vulnerability. They must be able to create user environment variables and have write access to a directory."
  },
  "fixes": "The fix involved changing the precedence order when resolving file paths in rules. The system now always prioritizes the System environment variables over User environment variables, preventing the exploitation through user-defined environment variables."
