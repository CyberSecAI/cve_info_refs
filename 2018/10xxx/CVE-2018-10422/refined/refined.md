The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10422.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "content" field when posting site news or editing normal content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application allows users to input arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the content field, which is then stored in the database and rendered on the website's front end without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected content. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement
- Information theft (e.g., stealing cookies)
- Phishing attacks by redirecting to malicious sites
- Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the admin panel to post news or edit "About Us" content.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the content field of the news or the "About Us" page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the admin panel.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable input fields ("content" field).
- No special system access is needed, but admin level access to the web application is required.
