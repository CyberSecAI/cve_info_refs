- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for critical functions on ports 30001/TCP to 30003/TCP. These ports listen for and execute arbitrary URScript code without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). Specifically, lack of authentication on ports that execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker with access to the vulnerable ports can execute arbitrary code on the robot controller, potentially gaining root access. This can lead to complete control of the device, allowing the attacker to manipulate its operation or cause other damage.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. A remote attacker gains access to the robot controller's network and then uses the exposed ports to send and execute arbitrary URScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable robot controller. No other specific requirements are listed. The vulnerability is considered low skill to exploit.
