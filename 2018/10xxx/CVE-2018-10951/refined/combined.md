| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=108894#c0)  Phil Pearl    2018-03-15 20:40:02 EDT  ``` The (admin) soap API allows the storing of zimbraSSLPrivateKey. The (admin) soap API also allows for the retrieval of the value via several calls (GetServer, GetAllServers, and GetAllActiveServers).  We should never return the value of the private key via our API calls. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=108894#c2)  David Bingham    2018-03-15 20:47:56 EDT  ``` NOTE about compatibility for SOAP services interacting with ZCS containing this fix.  SOAP requests, e.g. those in code for custom admin actions, may need to be updated to maintain compatibility beginning with this release. To address the security issue, the GetServer, GetAllServers, and GetAllActiveServers SOAP responses now send "VALUE_BLOCKED" for zimbraSSLPrivateKey by default. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=108894#c3)  David Bingham    2018-03-26 23:03:51 EDT  ``` Fixed in 8.8.8. ``` |  |
