  "CVE-2018-10489": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D Clod Progressive Mesh Declaration structures. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing U3D Clod Progressive Mesh Declaration structures, leading to a write past the end of an allocated memory structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-Bounds Write",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, requiring user interaction. This could involve the user visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file or a malicious web page containing specific U3D Clod Progressive Mesh Declaration structures."
