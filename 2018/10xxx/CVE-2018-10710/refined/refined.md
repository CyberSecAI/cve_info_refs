The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The AsrDrv driver exposes an IOCTL code (0x22280C) that allows reading and writing to arbitrary physical memory locations. The driver lacks proper access control, allowing non-privileged user processes to access this functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control (CWE-782)
- Arbitrary physical memory read/write

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges by modifying critical system data in physical memory. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates writing arbitrary data to physical memory, leading to a system crash, which can lead to code execution and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
Local exploitation by sending crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Local access to the system with the ability to open a handle to the vulnerable driver (AsrDrv101.sys). Non-privileged user processes can exploit this vulnerability.
