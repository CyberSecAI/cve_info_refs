I think these are 2 different projects. I propose splitting it into 2 packages for example:  abcm2ps abcplus  And keep these up-to-date independently from each other. the ABCPLUS docs are not only about abcm2ps but also about tools from abcMIDI (unfortunately not in Fedora yet, but that's another story), and about abcpp and abc2prt (also not in Fedora yet). If ever abcMIDI is included in Fedora, abcplus would serve as additional documentation for both abcm2ps and abcMIDI.  And I would welcome a newer abcm2ps version in the Fedora repo. For now I'm using a self-compiled abcm2ps version 8.7.7, latest upstream stable version is 7.8.14! 5.9.21 is REALLY old and a lot has happened in the development of the ABC syntax the last few years that is only supported with an up-to-date abcm2ps version.   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=1063718#c45)  Upstream Release Monitoring    2015-05-15 12:10:14 UTC  ``` Latest upstream release: 8.7.8 Current version/release in rawhide: 5.9.21-9.fc22 URL: <http://moinejf.free.fr/>  Please consult the package updates policy before you issue an update to a stable branch: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy>  More information about the service that created this bug can be found at: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upstream_release_monitoring>  Please keep in mind that with any upstream change, there may also be packaging changes that need to be made.

Two comments:  1) I think abcm2ps should be a project separate from the abcplus "Making Music with ABC PLUS" documentation. You have chosen to make it a subpackage, but it should be 2 really separate projects I think.  -abcm2ps (main author Jef Moine, <http://moinejf.free.fr>) -abcplus-doc (main author Guido Gonzato, <http://abcplus.sourceforge.net>)  Guido Gonzato's document (there is a much newer version available on his website) is about ABC music syntax and the use of not only abcm2ps but also the tools from the abcMIDI package. That's why I think abcplus-doc, would be a better package name than abcm2ps-doc.  This brings me to my next comment:  2) The tools from abcMIDI, maintained upstream by Seymour Shlien should also be available as Fedora package. Latest version 2020.05.06 can be found at <https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/runabc/top.html>  I am running abcm2ps and the abcMIDI tools on Fedora 32. Compiled them myself from sources, but official Fedora packages would be nice. But it's a good start that we now have a new abcm2ps Fedora package maintainer. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 194](show_bug.cgi?id=1063718#c194)  Fedora Admin user for bugzilla script actions    2020-05-13 02:45:12 UTC  ``` This package has changed maintainer in the Fedora.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-05-08 21:51:44 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-05-08 21:51:47 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1576117,1576118  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:49:21 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-12 17:49:43 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-eb7a965fcf has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-eb7a965fcf>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-12 17:49:44 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-a820f2b735 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-a820f2b735>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1576118#c5)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-13 03:56:00 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-a820f2b735 has been pushed to the Fedora 32 testing repository.
