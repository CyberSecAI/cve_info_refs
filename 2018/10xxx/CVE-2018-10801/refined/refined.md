- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Memory leaks in `_TIFFmalloc` within `libtiff/tif_unix.c` at line 241, which is a wrapper around `malloc`. The leak occurs when using `bmp2tiff` with a specific input, leading to unfreed memory allocations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak. Specifically, the `_TIFFmalloc` function does not free the allocated memory before the program terminates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak is reported to occur when the `bmp2tiff` tool is used and is considered harmless as it occurs at the end of the program's execution. However, a more serious impact may occur if the tool is called repeatedly or with larger files leading to possible resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by running the `bmp2tiff` tool with a specific input file and a `/dev/null` output.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to execute the `bmp2tiff` tool with a crafted or specific input.
