Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10101:

*   **RELATES TO CVE:** Yes, the content relates to CVE-2018-10101.

*   **Vulnerability:** Don't treat `localhost` as same host by default.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way WordPress handles URL validation, specifically in how it treats `localhost`. The code was modified to no longer automatically consider `localhost` as the same host as the main WordPress site.

*   **Impact:** This vulnerability could allow remote attackers to bypass restrictions or cause unsafe redirects.

*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating URL parameters or other input fields, an attacker could potentially redirect a user to a malicious site or bypass security checks that rely on proper hostname validation.

*   **Affected versions:** WordPress versions 4.9.4 and earlier.

*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to version WordPress 4.9.5 or later.

*   **Fix:**
    *   The fix involves modifying the `wp_http_validate_url()` function in `wp-includes/http.php` to remove the automatic same-host treatment for `localhost`.

    *   `$same_host = ( strtolower( $parsed_home['host'] ) === strtolower( $parsed_url['host'] ) || 'localhost' === strtolower( $parsed_url['host'] ) );` was changed to `$same_host = strtolower( $parsed_home['host'] ) === strtolower( $parsed_url['host'] );`

    *   Updated to version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u17 for oldstable (jessie).

    *   Updated to version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u3 for stable (stretch).
