Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The version string, obtained via `get_bloginfo('version')` or `get_bloginfo_rss('version')`, was not properly escaped when used within the generator meta tag or generator elements, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the version string was directly inserted into HTML attributes without proper encoding. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious script into the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the generator tag by manipulating the version information of the WordPress site. This injected script could then be executed within the user's browser, potentially leading to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulating the Version String:** An attacker would need to find a way to manipulate the version information returned by WordPress. This could potentially be achieved through various means, such as modifying database records or exploiting vulnerabilities related to version setting.
*   **Injection via Generator Tag:** The vulnerability is triggered when the generator meta tag or generator elements (in different contexts like HTML, XHTML, Atom, RSS2, RDF, comments, and exports) are generated, containing the unescaped version string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Modify Version Information:** The attacker needs the capability to influence or modify the version string information that WordPress uses in the generator tag.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** Once the manipulated version string is set and a page is loaded, the XSS payload will execute on client side, no direct interaction from another user is necessary.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `get_the_generator()` function within `wp-includes/general-template.php`.
*   The fix implemented was to use `esc_attr()` for HTML attributes, and `esc_url_raw()` for URL contexts when outputting the version string in the generator tag, ensuring it's properly escaped.
*   The affected versions are prior to 4.9.5.
*   The fix was introduced in changeset 42893.
*   This vulnerability is addressed in the security update for WordPress 4.9.5 and later versions.
