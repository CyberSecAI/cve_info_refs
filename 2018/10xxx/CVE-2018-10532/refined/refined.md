The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10532.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The EE 4GEE HH70 router has a hardcoded SSH root login using the username 'root' and password 'oelinux123'. This is due to a default configuration of the device's firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials for SSH root access
- The credentials were easily discoverable within the firmware by grepping the core_app binary.
- Lack of proper security practices by the manufacturer (EE) in using hardcoded credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full root access to the router's OpenWRT Linux-based system.
- Attackers can modify settings, hijack DNS, install spyware, or conduct other malicious activities on the router.
- The compromised router could be used as part of a botnet for launching attacks on other systems.
- Potential for redirection of browsers to malicious websites or crypto-mining.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local network access is required to exploit this vulnerability. This means the attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
- Malicious users or malware on devices connected to the router's Wi-Fi network could leverage this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be within the same local network as the vulnerable router.
- Basic knowledge of SSH and Linux systems is required to gain access and perform malicious actions.
