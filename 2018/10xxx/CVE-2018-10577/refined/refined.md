{
  "CVE-2018-10577": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is related to a hidden file upload functionality in the web interface of WatchGuard AP devices, which allows for remote code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The web interface contains a hidden 'wgupload' functionality that is not exposed to the user but is present in the code, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Hidden file upload functionality",
        "Lack of proper access control on the wgupload endpoint",
        "Remote code execution via uploaded file"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the device as root and execute them, leading to full compromise of the device.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;{stok}/wgupload` endpoint",
        "Including the device serial number, a valid session cookie (sysauth), and the filename in the cookie header",
        "Uploading a file containing shell code in the POST request body."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires a valid session and the serial number of the target device. The serial number can be retrieved from the web interface when logged in with a valid session. This can be achieved by exploiting the hardcoded credential vulnerability (CVE-2018-10575) and the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-10576)."
