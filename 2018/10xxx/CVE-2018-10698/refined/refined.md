Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-10698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure configuration of the Moxa AWK-3121 device where the Telnet service is enabled by default without encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unencrypted Telnet Service:** The device has Telnet enabled by default, which transmits data, including usernames and passwords, in plaintext. This makes it susceptible to eavesdropping.
- **Default Credentials:** If the user hasn't changed the default credentials, an attacker can log into the device via Telnet with those credentials, in addition to exploiting the sniffed information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data such as login credentials by sniffing the Telnet traffic.
- **Code Execution:**  An attacker who is able to gain access to the device via telnet can then execute commands on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can position themselves between the user and the device to capture network traffic (e.g., using ARP poisoning).
- **Network Sniffing:** The attacker uses network sniffing to intercept the telnet traffic which is unencrypted.
- **Telnet Access:** The attacker connects to the Telnet service directly, either via sniffed credentials or default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the Moxa AWK-3121 device or have the ability to intercept network traffic.
- **MITM Capabilities:** Ability to perform MITM attacks (e.g., ARP poisoning) is necessary to intercept the Telnet traffic, unless default credentials are in place.
