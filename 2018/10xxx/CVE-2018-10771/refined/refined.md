Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow located in the `get_key` function within the `parse.c` file of the `abcm2ps` software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `get_key` function improperly handles input, allowing an attacker to write beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The overflow can lead to application crashes, making the software unavailable.
- **Unspecified other impact:** There is a possibility of more severe consequences beyond a simple crash, although these are not detailed in the provided context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted ABC music description file.
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious ABC file to the `abcm2ps` program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious ABC file to the vulnerable application. This could happen via processing user-supplied files, network services, etc.
- No special privileges or prior access is explicitly mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The `abcm2ps` software translates ABC music description files to PostScript.
- The vulnerability is triggered within the parsing logic while processing input.
- The issue was identified in `abcm2ps` version 8.13.20.
- Patches were released to fix this issue.
- The issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora.
- The vulnerability was also fixed in Debian 9 stretch.
