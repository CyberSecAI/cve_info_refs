- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WUZHI CMS application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding new tags, specifically through the `tag` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores the unsanitized user-provided tag data, leading to the execution of malicious scripts when the tag is viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML. In this case, the attacker is able to steal cookies of an administrator when they are browsing the tag management page, due to the XSS payload being activated.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker, with the privileges of a website editor, can add a new tag with an XSS payload through a POST request to `/index.php?m=tags&f=index&v=add&&_su=wuzhicms&_menuid=?&_submenuid=?` using the `tag` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a website editor, a role with lower privileges than an administrator. The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request containing the XSS payload.
