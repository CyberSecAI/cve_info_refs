## Description

[![@Cass203](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17820658?u=732afe5da04a9334baeb4596954e554eb089bb42&v=4&size=48)](/Cass203)[Cass203](https://github.com/Cass203)opened [on Apr 18, 2018](https://github.com/wuzhicms/wuzhicms/issues/129#issue-315387348)

An issue was discovered in WUZHI CMS 4.1.0. There is a persistent XSS attacks vulnerability which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the tag[tag] parameter post to the /index.php?m=tags&f=index&v=add&&\_su=wuzhicms&\_menuid=?&\_submenuid=?

The attacker can add a new TAGS with the XSS payload after logining in as a website editor(a role whose privilege is lower than the administrator).

Exploit the vulnerability，a website editor can steal the cookies while the administrator browsing the TAGS Management and activate the XSS code .

POC：

Inject the XSS payload:<script>alert(/xss/)</script>
