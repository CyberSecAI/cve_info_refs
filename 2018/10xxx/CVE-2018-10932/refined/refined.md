{
  "CVE-2018-10932": {
    "Description": "lldptool can print a raw, unsanitized attacker controlled buffer when mngAddr information is displayed. This may allow an attacker to inject shell control characters into the buffer and impact the behavior of the terminal.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of shell-escape codes in the lldptool when displaying Management Address information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the lldptool prints the Management Address OID without proper sanitization."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject shell control characters into the output of lldptool, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the terminal or other unintended consequences.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by controlling the Management Address information included in the LLDP packets, which is then displayed by lldptool.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of LLDP packets, specifically the Management Address TLV, which could be achieved by being on the same network segment, or by controlling a device that sends LLDP packets. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform this attack."
