Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10925:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The bugzilla entry, the PostgreSQL release notes, the opensuse advisory, and the Ubuntu notice all explicitly mention CVE-2018-10925 with the description: `postgresql: Missing authorization and memory disclosure in INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE statements` or similar. This confirms the relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in a missing authorization check within PostgreSQL when processing `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statements, particularly when used with views. Specifically, the authorization check was insufficient when the view used for the update was not a simple `SELECT * FROM ...` .

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** PostgreSQL failed to properly verify permissions when using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement in conjunction with complex views.
*   **Memory Disclosure:** An attacker with `CREATE TABLE` privileges could leverage this flaw to read arbitrary bytes from server memory.
*   **Data Integrity Issue:** An attacker with specific `INSERT` and limited `UPDATE` privileges could exploit this flaw to update columns in a table for which they did not possess the necessary `UPDATE` privileges.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory disclosure:** An attacker could leak sensitive server data by reading arbitrary bytes from server memory.
*   **Data integrity:** An attacker could bypass column-level permission controls to modify data in ways not intended or authorized.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable by issuing SQL queries.
*   The primary attack vector is through the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statement.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **`CREATE TABLE` privilege:**  An attacker must have the ability to create tables to leverage the memory disclosure. This privilege is often granted to users by default.
*   **`INSERT` and limited `UPDATE` privileges (for data integrity):** An attacker needs specific `INSERT` privileges on a table and also `UPDATE` privileges on at least one column in the same table to perform unauthorized updates to other columns.
*   **Network Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection, as seen in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because of how PostgreSQL expands the view definition during the execution of `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`.
*   The issue is addressed in PostgreSQL versions 9.5.14, 9.6.10, and 10.5, and is not present in 9.4 and earlier because the `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` clause was introduced in 9.5.
*   The vulnerability is not known to be exploitable under specific Red Hat Virtualization and Satellite 5.8 configurations but was addressed in later updates.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-10925 is a critical vulnerability in PostgreSQL arising from a missing authorization check in  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statements, leading to potential memory disclosure and data corruption. Attackers with the ability to create tables (often available to regular users) can exploit this to read arbitrary bytes of server memory. Attackers with additional permissions can use this to bypass column update permissions, leading to data integrity issues. The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions 9.5 and higher and requires updates to mitigate.
