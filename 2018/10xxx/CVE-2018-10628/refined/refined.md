Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10628

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in AVEVA InTouch HMI software. This is due to a lack of proper input validation when handling network packets. The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted packet is sent to the InTouch application on systems that are not using a dot (.) as a floating-point separator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121): The software fails to properly validate the size of input data leading to a buffer overflow. Specifically when dealing with locales not using dot as floating point separator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the InTouch View process. This could lead to a complete compromise of the InTouch HMI system.
- System Compromise: This can lead to full control of the HMI, allowing attackers to manipulate industrial processes, potentially leading to physical damage, or disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted over the network by sending a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable system.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable InTouch system via the network.
- Low Skill Level: The advisory mentions "low skill level to exploit".

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects multiple versions of AVEVA InTouch including InTouch 2014 R2 SP1 and prior, InTouch 2017, InTouch 2017 Update 1, and InTouch 2017 Update 2.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a high CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity. The CVSS vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, showing it can be exploited remotely with low complexity and without user interaction, leading to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Mitigations:** AVEVA released hotfixes for InTouch 2014 R2 SP1 (HF-11_1_SP1/CR149705) and InTouch 2017 Update 2 (HF-17_2/CR149706). Users of older versions must upgrade to a supported version before applying the hotfixes. Also, general recommendations to minimize exposure through network segmentation and firewall use are advised.
- **Reported by:** George Lashenko of CyberX reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.
