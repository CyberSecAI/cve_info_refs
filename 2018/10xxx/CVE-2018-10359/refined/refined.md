Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10359

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the TMWFP driver within Trend Micro OfficeScan. It stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data length when processing IOCTL 0x220078. Specifically, the driver uses the unvalidated length to initialize a pool-based buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow or pool corruption.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input validation for the length of user-supplied data before initializing a pool-based buffer.
*  **Impact:**  A successful exploit can lead to privilege escalation to the kernel level.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited locally. An attacker needs to execute low-privileged code on the target system as a prerequisite.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the TMWFP driver.
*   Trend Micro released an update to patch this vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to kernel level on a vulnerable system.
