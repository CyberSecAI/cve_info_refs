  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `/download` endpoint in `redhat-certification` does not validate the `rpath` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can download any file accessible by the user running the httpd server.",

      "Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/download` endpoint with a malicious `rpath` parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication and can be located remotely. They need to know the server address and be able to send HTTP requests."
