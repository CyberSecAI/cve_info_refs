## [OpenMPT 1.27.07.00 released](https://openmpt.org/openmpt-1-27-07-00-released "Permalink to OpenMPT 1.27.07.00 released")

Posted on
8 April 2018 - 11:35

by Saga Musix

Another small update for [OpenMPT 1.27](https://openmpt.org/download) containing mostly
bugfixes and some small improvements has been released today. Most
importantly, this update fixes a bug where importing soundfont
instruments into IT / XM files accidentally enabled the volume
envelope's release node. Since the release node is an MPTM-specific
feature, but could still be saved in such files for legacy purposes, the
saved IT / XM files could sound vastly different when played in other
software. You are strongly encouraged to to update if you make frequent
use of SF2 and DLS instruments. The following other things have changed:

* Keep track of active SFx macro during seeking.
* Prepend plugin name to default filename when saving a plugin preset
  or bank.
* The "note cut" duplicate note action did not volume-ramp the
  previously playing sample.
* DSM: Support restart position and 16-bit samples.
* DTM: Import global volume.
* Possible crash when calculating song length in patterns with many
  nested pattern loops.

For a complete list of changes, have a look at the [release
notes](/release_notes/OMPT_1.27_ReleaseNotes.html) and the [full version
history](https://openmpt.org/release_notes/History.txt).

has also been updated with the same loader and playback fixes.
