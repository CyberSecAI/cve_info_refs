Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the PAN-OS response for the GlobalProtect Gateway. Specifically, the application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input during web page generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The GlobalProtect Gateway is vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary JavaScript or HTML through a crafted response, without proper sanitization/encoding of user input

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript/HTML Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the context of a user's browser session on the GlobalProtect Gateway.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):** An attacker could potentially use injected scripts to access and exfiltrate sensitive information, such as cookies, session tokens, or user data.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** An attacker could modify the content displayed to the user, potentially redirecting them to malicious sites or changing data.
- **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the system or service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires the victim to interact with a malicious link or resource, such as clicking a manipulated link or accessing a malicious webpage.
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the PAN-OS response of GlobalProtect Gateway. This could be done by crafting malicious requests.
- The attacker needs to lure a user to visit the crafted link to trigger the injected JavaScript payload.

**Affected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 6.1.21 and earlier
- PAN-OS 7.1.18 and earlier
- PAN-OS 8.0.11 and earlier

**Unaffected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 8.1.0 and later
- PAN-OS 8.0.12 and later
- PAN-OS 7.1.19 and later

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
The provided information offers more detail than a basic CVE description by providing:
- Specific vulnerable versions of PAN-OS.
- CVSS v3.1 score with a breakdown of impact metrics
- Identification of the CWE (CWE-79).
