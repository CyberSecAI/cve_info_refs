Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the TMWFP driver within Trend Micro OfficeScan. Specifically, it is caused by the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before using it to initialize a pool-based buffer. This lack of validation occurs when processing IOCTL 0x220008.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Data Validation:** The driver fails to validate the length of user-supplied data. This allows an attacker to control the size of a buffer allocated in the kernel pool.
- **Pool Corruption:** By providing a specially crafted length, an attacker can cause a pool overflow during buffer allocation. This leads to pool corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges to kernel level. This means they can gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack must be executed locally on the target machine.
- **IOCTL:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific IO control code (IOCTL), 0x220008, to the TMWFP driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Ability to Interact with Kernel Driver:** The attacker must be able to send IOCTL commands to the vulnerable TMWFP driver.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that Trend Micro has released an update to correct the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Trend Micro on 2018-02-02, and the coordinated public release was on 2018-06-07.
