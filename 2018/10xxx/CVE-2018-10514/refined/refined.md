- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `coreServiceShell` service's improper impersonation of the client before executing sensitive operations while processing request ID 0x2ff0000b in request ID\_AMSP\_MASTER.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing impersonation privilege. The service does not properly impersonate the client before executing sensitive operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges to SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
