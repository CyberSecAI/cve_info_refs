[![@reecewalsh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33012349?u=435483a48fda7eb46f640af7ffe731438ccff5e9&v=4&size=48)](/reecewalsh)[reecewalsh](https://github.com/reecewalsh)opened [on Apr 13, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4474#issue-313935400)
# Version:

Tested and replicated in Octopus version 2018.3.13

# Issue:

The logged-in user is able to view/update/save variable values within the `Tenant Variables` area for Environments that do not exist within their associated Team scoping.

This occurs in situations where the logged-in Users also belongs to multiple teams where one of the Teams has the `VariableEdit` permission for `VariableView` permissions exist for the environment.

# Replication Steps:

1. Create a Test Project with `Multi-Tenant Deployments enabled`

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33012349/38711258-f97d88d4-3f07-11e8-9ce6-3379a3ff3f16.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33012349/38711258-f97d88d4-3f07-11e8-9ce6-3379a3ff3f16.png)

2. Connect the associated Project to a newly generated Tenant and select two environments (i.e. `Testing` & `UAT`);

3. Create a Project Template within the Project;

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33012349/38711277-1e11aa0e-3f08-11e8-9007-e5791c5ae83f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33012349/38711277-1e11aa0e-3f08-11e8-9007-e5791c5ae83f.png)

4. Create a Test Octopus User
5. Create two Teams based on the Permissions information specified below and associate the newly created User with these Teams.
6. Login to Octopus as the newly created User
7. Navigate to `Tenants` > `Variables`
8. In this area it's possible to view/update/save variables belonging to environments that are not specified within the `Team` that has the `UserRole` required containing the `VariableEdit` permission
9. The expected behavior here would be still be able to view the variable but updating/saving should not be an option;
