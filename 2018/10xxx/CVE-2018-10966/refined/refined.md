Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10966

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded secret key in `config/environments/all.js` which is used for signing session cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The application uses a hard-coded secret in the cookie session configuration.
- **CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data:** Because the secret is known, an attacker can forge a session cookie with a manipulated ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
-  Forge session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to other user accounts.
-  Escalate privileges.
-  Take over accounts by manipulating the session cookie to contain the ID number of the account they want to take over, then re-sign it using the hard coded secret.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. An attacker can send malicious HTTP requests with a forged session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate HTTP requests.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the session cookie and the hard-coded secret.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the hard-coded secret and instead using an environment variable.
- The vulnerable code is located in `config/environments/all.js` at line 58.
- The fix is implemented in pull request #56 on the repository.
- The vulnerable software is GamerPolls version 0.4.6.
