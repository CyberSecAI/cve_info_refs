**Description**

This pull request fixes a security issue by removing the hard coded cookie secret. This change will instead make the application fetch it from the environment variable `GAMERPOLLS_COOKIE_SECRET`.

By using a hard coded secret, a would-be attacker could manipulate the cookie data and re-sign it using the same cookie secret - potentially leading to an authentication bypass and privilege escalation.

**Vulnerability Classification**

CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password

CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data

**CVE-ID**

[CVE-2018-10966](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-10966/)

**CVSS v3 Score**

6.5 (Medium)

**CVSS v3 Vector**
