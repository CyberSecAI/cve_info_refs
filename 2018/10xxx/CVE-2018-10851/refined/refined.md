Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory leak occurs in PowerDNS Authoritative Server and PowerDNS Recursor while parsing malformed DNS records. The memory allocated during parsing is not always properly released if the record is invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** Failure to release allocated memory during parsing of malformed DNS records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending queries with malformed records can lead to memory exhaustion and a crash.
    - In the Authoritative Server, this can be triggered by an authorized user who has control over a zone.
    - In the Recursor, this can be triggered by a malicious authoritative server sending crafted responses.
- A crash may lead to service degradation as an out-of-memory crash can lead to an automatic restart if a supervisor is being used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authoritative Server:** An authorized user can insert specially crafted records in a zone they control and then send DNS queries for that zone.
- **Recursor:** A malicious authoritative server can send specially crafted records in response to a legitimate query by an authorized user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authoritative Server:** Attacker needs to be an authorized user with control over a DNS zone.
- **Recursor:** Attacker needs to be a malicious authoritative server that can respond to DNS queries sent to the recursor.

**Affected Versions:**
- **PowerDNS Authoritative Server:** 3.3.0 up to and including 4.1.4
- **PowerDNS Recursor:** 3.2 up to and including 4.1.4

**Fixed Versions:**
- **PowerDNS Authoritative Server:** 4.1.5, 4.0.6
- **PowerDNS Recursor:** 4.1.5, 4.0.9
