### [VS-2018-020] IPVanish for MacOS Root Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

#### CVE ID

CVE-2018-10192

#### CVSS Score

Pending

#### Vendor

IPVanish VPN

#### Product

IPVanish VPN for macOS

#### Product Version

3.0.11

#### Vulnerability Details

IPVanish for MacOS suffers from a root privilege escalation vulnerability. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper`  LaunchDaemon implements a insecure XPC service that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user. IPVanish uses a third-party library for converting `xpc_object_t` types in to `NSObject` types for sending XPC messages. When IPVanish establishes a new connection the following XPC message is sent to the `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon. Because the XPC service itself does not validate incoming connection, this means any application installed on the operation system can send it XPC messages. In the case of the "connect" message, an attacker could manipulate the `OpenVPNPath` to point at a malicious binary on the system. The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` would receive the VPNHelperConnect command, then execute the malicious binary as the root user.
