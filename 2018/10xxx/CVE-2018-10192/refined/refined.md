The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10192.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon implements an insecure XPC service. It does not validate incoming connections, allowing any application on the system to send it XPC messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure XPC service implementation.
- Lack of validation of incoming connections to the XPC service.
- Usage of a third-party library for converting `xpc_object_t` types to `NSObject` types.
- The service executes the path specified in `OpenVPNPath` field of the "connect" message, which allows to inject a malicious binary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve root privilege escalation by sending a crafted XPC message to the vulnerable service, specifying a malicious binary. This results in arbitrary code execution as the root user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted XPC message to the `com.ipvanish.osx.vpnhelper` LaunchDaemon.
- Manipulating the `OpenVPNPath` parameter within the XPC message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to send XPC messages to the vulnerable service. This can be achieved by having an application installed on the target system.
- The attacker needs to have write access to a location in the filesystem where they can place a malicious binary.
