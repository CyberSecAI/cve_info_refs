{
  "CVE-2018-10534": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the _bfd_XX_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common function in peXXigen.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, processes a negative Data Directory size with an unbounded loop that increases the value of (external_IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY) *edd so that the address exceeds its own memory region, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory write, as demonstrated by objcopy copying private info with _bfd_pex64_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common in pex64igen.c.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of a negative Data Directory size in the _bfd_XX_bfd_copy_private_bfd_data_common function within the Binary File Descriptor library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds memory write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to out-of-bounds memory write.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Processing a specially-crafted file."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to trick a user or system into processing a crafted file."
  }
