The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) versions <= 2.2.6 and <= 2.2.7.  Specifically, it identifies CVE-2018-10081 as an admin password reset vulnerability.

**CVE-2018-10081 - Admin Password Reset Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The password reset functionality uses a fixed hash for each admin user, and the hash comparison is done with a weak type comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Fixed password reset hashes for admin users.
    *   Use of loose comparison (`==`) instead of strict comparison (`===`) in the password reset hash check.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can reset the password of an admin user without needing to obtain a reset link via email.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess a hash value that starts with "0e" which when compared loosely with an existing reset hash evaluates as true.
    * The attacker sends this crafted value to /admin/login.php to initiate the reset.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network access to the login page.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess a valid password reset hash which can be a predictable value starting with '0e'.
