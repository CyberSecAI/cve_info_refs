It provides the following details about the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** Improper implementation of the `glusterfs.file` function.\n\n**Vulnerability:** Information Exposure vulnerability. An attacker can use this to obtain information about files.\n\n**Impact:** Information disclosure about the existence of files on the glusterfs server.\n\n**Attack Vector:**  An attacker can issue an xattr request via GlusterFS FUSE\n\n**Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to issue an xattr request via glusterfs FUSE. The vulnerability is in `posix_get_file_contents` function in `posix-helpers.c`\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   The bug report mentions that SELinux mitigates the issue on Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 when in enforcing mode, but not in permissive mode.\n*   It also indicates that the issue affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor, but in recommended configurations, it is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can't be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network.\n*   The upstream fix is available at <https://review.gluster.org/21071>."

It provides the following details about the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** An information disclosure vulnerability in the glusterfs server.\n\n**Vulnerability:** An attacker could issue an xattr request via glusterfs FUSE to determine the existence of any file. This can allow for information disclosure about file existence.\n\n**Impact:** An attacker could potentially determine the existence of files on the glusterfs server.\n\n**Attack Vector:** Network, via xattr requests using glusterfs FUSE\n\n**Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs low privileges and network access to send a crafted xattr request.\n\n**Additional Information**:\n*   SUSE rates the severity of this issue as low.  CVSS 3.1 score from NVD is 6.5(high confidentiality impact) while SUSE gives it a 3.5(low confidentiality impact).\n*   It notes the attack vector as Network, with low access complexity, low privileges required and no user interaction.\n*   The SUSE Bugzilla entries are also referenced: 1105776 and 1107021."
