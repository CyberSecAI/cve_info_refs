- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ZCS Admin UI has a persistent XSS vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied input in two similar attributes/fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would execute in the browsers of other users when they access the affected fields in the ZCS Admin UI. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields via the Admin UI. The code is stored on the server. When a user views the affected fields in the UI, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify specific fields in the ZCS Admin UI. It is not explicitly stated if this requires specific administrative privileges but it is implied that the attacker would have to be an authenticated user.
