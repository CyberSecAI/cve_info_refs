- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when editing snippets, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize the input provided in the snippet name field when editing a snippet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to potential actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites when a user views the affected snippet.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker, with administrative privileges, injects malicious code into the "Name" field while editing a snippet through the admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the snippet edit functionality.
