Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-10100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The redirection URL for the login page was not validated or sanitized when forced to use HTTPS. Specifically, the `wp_redirect()` function was used instead of `wp_safe_redirect()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe Redirect: The use of `wp_redirect()` without proper sanitization or validation of the redirection URL could allow an attacker to control the redirect destination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Open Redirect: An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when visited, would redirect a user to an attacker-controlled site. This can be used for phishing attacks, where the user is tricked into providing credentials or other sensitive information on a fake login page disguised as the real one.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted URL: An attacker would need to create a malicious URL that would trigger the vulnerable redirect in the WordPress login process when SSL is forced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a URL that exploits the lack of sanitization in the login redirect process. No specific user privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `wp-login.php` file.
- The fix involved replacing `wp_redirect()` with `wp_safe_redirect()`, which validates and sanitizes the URL before redirecting, preventing redirection to arbitrary external sites.
- This issue was addressed in WordPress version 4.9.5 and also backported to older versions (3.6.1 and 4.7.5) in Debian LTS and security updates.
