Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Name field" when creating or editing pages in Monstra CMS. Specifically, the code at `monstra-3.0.4/plugins/box/pages/pages.admin.php`, lines 222-233, directly adds and displays the POST data without proper filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the "Name field" is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the browsers of anyone visiting the affected page, including administrators, editors, and regular users.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies and session information to gain control of user accounts.
- **Website Defacement/Malware Distribution:** Attackers could modify the website content or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of Monstra CMS.
- **POST Request:** Attackers must send a POST request to the page creation/edit handler with the malicious payload in the "Name" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into Monstra CMS with the ability to create or edit pages.
- **CSRF token:** The exploit code provided in exploit-db, shows that attacker must also have CSRF token for the page.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a JavaScript `alert(document.cookie)` payload into the `page_title` field (which appears to be used as the page name), although the original report mentioned the "Name field".
- The vulnerability affects Monstra CMS version 3.0.4 and earlier.
- The issue was also mentioned in previous reports [#427](https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/issues/427) and [#435](https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/issues/435).
- Mitigation suggested was to filter user input.

In summary, this is a stored XSS vulnerability where unsanitized user input allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on pages created or edited through the CMS's admin panel.
