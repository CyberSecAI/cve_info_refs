Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-10700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Moxa AWK-3121 device allows modification of its device name via a web interface. The input field for the device name, specifically the POST parameter `iw_board_deviceName`, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks because it does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device is susceptible to stored XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `iw_board_deviceName` field. This injected code will be executed when the device name is displayed in the web interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they view the affected page on the web interface.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** By using malicious JavaScript, an attacker could perform actions on behalf of the logged-in administrator. This could allow the attacker to modify device settings, create new administrator accounts, or perform other privileged actions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal session cookies, sensitive information displayed on the web interface, or other data that can be accessed by the browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely via the web interface of the Moxa AWK-3121 device.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker would typically use a CSRF attack to trick an authenticated administrator into submitting a malicious request that injects the XSS payload into the `iw_board_deviceName` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an administrator into visiting a malicious page while they are logged into the Moxa AWK-3121 device's web interface.
- An attacker needs network connectivity to the Moxa AWK-3121 device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `iw_board_deviceName` within the POST request to `/forms/iw_webSetParameters`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) shows an example of an HTML form that can be used to trigger the vulnerability by submitting a malicious device name.
- The vulnerability is present in Moxa AWK-3121 version 1.19.
