- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A maliciously crafted project file can cause a buffer overflow due to a lack of input size validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, view sensitive information and disrupt the availability of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a maliciously crafted project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can exploit this remotely, and requires low skill to exploit. The user needs to open the malicious project file.
