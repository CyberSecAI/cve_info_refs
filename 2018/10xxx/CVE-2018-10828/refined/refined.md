Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10828

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ApMsgFwd.exe` process, which is part of the Dell Touchpad driver (and similar drivers from ALPS for other manufacturers like VAIO and Thinkpad). This process allows the current user to map and write to a shared memory section named "ApMsgFwd File Mapping Object". The data written to this memory section is used by `ApMsgFwd.exe` as arguments to functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated Input:** `ApMsgFwd.exe` does not properly validate the data written to the shared memory section before using it as function arguments.
- **Shared Memory Vulnerability:**  The shared memory mechanism is vulnerable to user-controlled writes that can lead to unintended behavior when processed by `ApMsgFwd.exe`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By writing invalid pointers or data to the mapped section, an attacker can cause `ApMsgFwd.exe` to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The crash details show an access violation when the process attempts to access memory at an invalid address controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user who can gain access to the shared memory region and write data. 
- **Shared Memory Manipulation:** The attacker crafts specific malicious input that is then written to the shared memory region to cause a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access on the system where the vulnerable `ApMsgFwd.exe` process is running.
- **Ability to Interact with Shared Memory:** The attacker needs to be able to open the file mapping object (`ApMsgFwd File Mapping Object`) and write data to it.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to craft specific data that will cause the crash, such as invalid memory addresses.

**Technical Details from Exploit Code:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to:
    - Open the shared memory mapping using `OpenFileMappingA`.
    - Map a view of the shared memory into the process using `MapViewOfFile`.
    - Open the event used to signal `ApMsgFwd.exe` to process data using `OpenEventA`.
    - Write specific values (in this case, the attacker-controlled address `0x5D05D05D` and `0xD05D05D0` which will be used as pointers) into the shared memory at specified offsets (0x60 and 0x64).
    - Signal the event to trigger processing.
- This leads to a crash in `KERNELBASE!MultiByteToWideChar` when the process dereferences the attacker-controlled pointer, as observed in the crash dump.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code is written in C and targets the Windows platform, where `ApMsgFwd.exe` is typically found.
- The provided exploit specifically targets version 8.1.0.44 of the `ApMsgFwd.exe` module.
- The vulnerability impacts multiple vendors due to ALPS being the vendor of the driver software.
