- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Two CSRF vulnerabilities are present, which can be exploited to add an administrator account.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to add an administrator account, potentially leading to complete control over the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking an authenticated administrator into visiting a crafted web page (or link), as demonstrated by the provided PoC (Proof of Concept) link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website in order to perform the CSRF attack. This requires social engineering skills or a suitable channel to deliver the malicious link.
