Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-10106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of insufficient access control and lack of input sanitization in the D-Link DIR-815 router's firmware. Specifically, the `getcfg.php` script:

*   Relies on the `$_GLOBALS["AUTHORIZED_GROUP"]` variable for access control, which can be manipulated by crafting a specific HTTP request.
*   Passes the user-controlled `$_POST["SERVICES"]` variable to the `dophp("load", $file)` function without any sanitization, leading to arbitrary file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Permission Bypass:** The `is_power_user()` function checks the `$_GLOBALS["AUTHORIZED_GROUP"]` variable which can be bypassed by injecting a crafted `_POST_AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1` into the request. This allows an unauthenticated user to gain access to privileged functions.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Due to the lack of sanitization in `$_POST["SERVICES"]`, an attacker can control the `$file` variable in `dophp("load", $file)`. This allows the attacker to include arbitrary PHP scripts, such as `DEVICE.ACCOUNT.xml.php`, which discloses sensitive information like router usernames and passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Router Takeover:** By obtaining the router's admin credentials, an attacker can gain full control of the device, potentially changing its settings, and using it as a part of a botnet, or for other malicious purposes.
*   **Data Exposure:** Exposure of sensitive information such as usernames and passwords for the router and possibly any other stored credentials.
*   **Network Compromise:** A compromised router can allow the attacker to intercept or modify network traffic, leading to further attacks on the LAN network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a GET request to `getcfg.php` with the following format `?a=%0a_POST_SERVICES%3D[FILE_TO_INCLUDE]%0aAUTHORIZED_GROUP%3D1`, where `[FILE_TO_INCLUDE]` is the desired file for inclusion.
*   **HTTP Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting specially crafted parameters into the HTTP request, specifically in the URL itself, by crafting a string using the `%0a` character which translates to a new line and by utilizing `_POST` parameters in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, which is typically available on the LAN side but may also be exposed on the WAN side depending on the router's configuration.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker should know how to send HTTP requests using a browser or a tool like `curl`
*   **Understanding of PHP request processing:** The attacker needs to understand how PHP processes HTTP requests and extracts variables from the query string and how to inject such variables.

**Additional Information:**

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) request demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited, which is not included in the official CVE description.
The POC provides the exact request to exploit the vulnerability: `GET /getcfg.php?a=%0a_POST_SERVICES%3DDEVICE.ACCOUNT%0aAUTHORIZED_GROUP%3D1 HTTP/1.1`, which leads to the router outputting the admin username and password.
