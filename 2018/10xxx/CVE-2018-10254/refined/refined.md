CVE-2018-10254:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer over-read in the disasm function of the disasm/disasm.c file due to a crafted ELF file
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer over-read.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service, potentially other unspecified impacts.
- Attack vectors: Crafted ELF file processed by the disassembler.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access, user interaction (opening/processing the crafted file).

CVE-2018-1000667:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Memory corruption due to function assemble_file(inname, depend_ptr) at asm/nasm.c:482
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Memory corruption, crash
- Impact of exploitation: Program abort/crash
- Attack vectors: Specially crafted asm file
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access, user interaction (opening/processing the crafted file).

CVE-2018-16517:
- Root cause of vulnerability: NULL pointer dereference in asm/labels.c.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service
- Attack vectors: Crafted file
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access, user interaction (opening/processing the crafted file).

CVE-2018-10016:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Division-by-zero vulnerability in the expr5 function in asm/eval.c.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Division-by-zero.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service.
- Attack vectors: Malformed input file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access, user interaction (opening/processing the crafted file).

CVE-2018-10316:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Endless while loop in the assemble_file function of asm/nasm.c due to a globallineno integer overflow.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Endless loop due to integer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of service
- Attack vectors: Malformed input file
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Local access, user interaction (opening/processing the crafted file).
