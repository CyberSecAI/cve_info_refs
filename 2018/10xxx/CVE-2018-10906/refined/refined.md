{
  "CVE-2018-10906": {
    "Description": "fuse: bypass of the \"user_allow_other\" restriction when SELinux is active",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of backslashes when checking mount options in fusermount, along with the use of a blacklist instead of a whitelist for mount options, which does not include options understood by SELinux and Smack LSMs. Additionally, the SELinux LSM parsing of context strings is lax, allowing the smuggling of backslashes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect handling of backslashes in mount options",
      "Use of a blacklist instead of a whitelist for mount options",
      "Lax parsing of SELinux context strings"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can bypass the system's 'user_allow_other' restriction and mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' option, making it accessible to other users, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or other unspecified effects by tricking other users into accessing files on the mounted file system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation using the 'fusermount' command"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, non-root user with the ability to execute 'fusermount'"
  }
