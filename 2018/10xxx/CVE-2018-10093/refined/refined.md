Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper filtering of user inputs in the CGI scripts used by the AudioCodes 400HD series IP phones, specifically the `command.cgi` script. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where the application executes attacker-supplied commands on the server operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
*   **Full Control Over Device:** This can lead to complete control of the IP phone.
*   **Interception of Communications:** Attackers can potentially intercept live phone calls and other communications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely through the web interface of the IP phone.
*   **CGI Script:** The specific vulnerable script is `command.cgi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable page, requiring possession of the administrator configuration password.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability was tested on the AudioCodes 420HD phone with firmware version 2.2.12.126. Other devices in the 400HD series may also be vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** AudioCodes recommends changing the default administrator credentials to mitigate the issue.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.2 with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RC:C, indicating high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Exploit:** The vulnerability can be exploited by visiting the `/command.cgi` script and appending shell commands to the URL. For example `/command.cgi?cat%20/etc/passwd`.
