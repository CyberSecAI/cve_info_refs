## Description

[![@starnightcyber](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19260696?u=01acf65c5329cd3968652b81f17cfbe449c6142e&v=4&size=48)](/starnightcyber)[starnightcyber](https://github.com/starnightcyber)opened [on Apr 23, 2018](https://github.com/bg5sbk/MiniCMS/issues/18#issue-316845602)

I found two information leakage vulnerabilities in MiniCMS, you need to login the backstage first.

## The first one reveals the web root files on the web server:

### Steps to reproduce:

1、Login in to the backstage <http://192.168.232.181/MiniCMS-master/mc-admin/>

2、Post an article

3、Checked the page and see

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/1.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/1.png)

4、The url will direct to the following...

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/2.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/2.png)

We can see all the files locate in web root the the server.

## The second reveals the real path of the MiniCMS files

### Steps to reproduce

1、Login in to the backstage <http://192.168.232.181/MiniCMS-master/mc-admin/>

2、Post an article

3、Try to re-edit this page, actually this page is save as iabl13.dat

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/3.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/3.png)

we can see :

4、Using burp to intercept this request

the original id is iabl13, and we change to hello-iabl13

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/5.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/5.png)

5、Actually hello-iabl13 is not really exists, error occurs

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/6.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starnightcyber/Miscellaneous/master/MiniCMS/6.png)

This vulnerability reveals the full path of MiniCMS
