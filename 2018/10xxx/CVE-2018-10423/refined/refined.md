```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The MiniCMS application reveals sensitive information due to improper handling of file paths and error messages.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Information Disclosure: The application leaks the web root files and the real path of the MiniCMS files.
  - Path Traversal: Although not explicitly stated, the manipulation of file identifiers in the second vulnerability suggests a potential for path traversal if the application does not properly sanitize the input.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file structure and the absolute path of the MiniCMS installation, which can be used to plan further attacks or exploit other vulnerabilities.
- Attack vectors:
  - The first vulnerability is triggered by creating a new article and inspecting the HTML source code which reveals the directory path.
  - The second vulnerability is triggered by attempting to edit an article, intercepting the request, manipulating the file identifier, and observing the error message.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the MiniCMS administrator panel.
  - The attacker needs to be able to use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML and use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate requests.
