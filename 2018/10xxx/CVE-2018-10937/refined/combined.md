* Require a CSRF token on all proxied requests. This prevents loading

  content hosted from a pod under the console domain by clicking on a

  link that uses the console proxy. Previously, it was not required for

  GET requests.
* Do not forward the X-CSRFToken header through the proxy.
* Set `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` in the proxied

  response to prevent scripts from running in proxied content.

In order to support the CSRF token for WebSockets, this adds an

`x-csrf-token` query parameter when headers can't be set. It also updates

the console to check the `Origin` header when present since `Referer` is

not set for WebSockets.

| [@spadgett](https://github.com/spadgett) one quick question: how does we including csrf-token into proxied requests to perform GET requests? It can get application content with **web console** proxy from terminal like:  `curl -k -X GET https://<master>/api/v1/namespaces/hasha-pro1/services/ruby-ex:8080-tcp/proxy/ --header "Authorization: Bearer l22bZp9lMQ5Vr6PpfuHIjqu-tvzWLr4dyMjcPNahWVI"`. I tried with CSRF token on the **admin** console but get nothing output: <http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/641927>. The CSRF token copied from Storage/Cookie value on the admin console develop windows. I am not clear about it yet, could you point me how to make it works? Thanks! |

| [@SSshahan](https://github.com/SSshahan) You need to include both the `X-CSRFToken` and `Authorization` headers in the request. I don't see `Authorization` in the pastebin. You should try curl with `-v` for verbose output.  edit: This should actually be a cookie not the authorization header... (Getting my consoles mixed up.) |

| [@spadgett](https://github.com/spadgett) thanks, but get `401 Unauthorized` error with `user` and `X-CSRFToken` setting. The `X-CSRFToken` comes from the `csrf-token` value in the Storage/Cookie by enter F12. <http://pastebin.test.redhat.com/644276>. Any other places with the wrong thing? |

| Right, it's expected since the request doesn't have the two cookies. You should include the `csrf-token` and `openshift-session-token` cookies in the request.  I'd recommend using "Copy -> Copy as cURL" from the Network tab of Chrome developer tools. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1622372#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2018-08-27 00:30:05 UTC  ``` A XSS flaw exists in the tetonic-console component of Openshift Container Platfrom 3.11. An attacker with the ability to create pods can use this flaw to perform actions on the K8s API as the victim.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1622372#c3)  Jason Shepherd    2018-08-27 00:51:19 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Sam Padgett (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1622372#c4)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-27 21:27:34 UTC  ``` References: <https://github.com/openshift/console/pull/461>  Upstream fix: <https://github.com/openshift/console/commit/d56666852da6e7309a2e63a49f49a72ff66d309c>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1622372#c8)  Jason Shepherd    2019-03-28 01:14:38 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was fixed prior to the release of OpenShift 3.11, so the initial release of that version was not affected.   ``` |  |
