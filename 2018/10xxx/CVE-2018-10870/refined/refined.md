```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `rhcertStore.py:__saveResultsFile` function in `redhat-certification` does not properly sanitize file paths. The `resultsFileName` is constructed by concatenating fixed strings with attacker-controlled strings. Specifically, the `clientIP` from the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header is used in the path creation, which is under attacker control.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal, improper input sanitization.

- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.

- Attack vectors: By manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, a remote attacker can control parts of the file path being written to via the `__saveResultsFile` function when uploading a "transfer" file to the `/save` endpoint.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server and manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
