Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10931:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `CobblerXMLRPCInterface` in cobbler exposed all its methods over XMLRPC. This design flaw allowed an unauthenticated attacker to access internal functions of the class that were intended to be private.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure API Exposure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of private methods through the XMLRPC interface.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The exposed XMLRPC interface did not require authentication, enabling unauthenticated access to the private methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Gain Privileges:** Execute internal functions, which could lead to privilege escalation within cobbler.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Upload files to arbitrary locations within the daemon's context.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While mitigated by SELinux, it was mentioned that basic attacks allowing RCE could be possible, but it does not exclude all possibilities, highlighting a potential risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attack vector is remote and does not require any prior authentication.
*   **XMLRPC Interface:** Exploitation is performed via the insecurely exposed XMLRPC interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the cobbler instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required, enabling a broad range of potential attackers.
*   **Knowledge of Cobbler API:** An understanding of cobbler's internal API and the exposed methods was needed to take advantage of this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Cedric Buissart of Red Hat.
*   A patch was created and made available as an attachment in the bug report.
*   The issue was addressed in Red Hat Satellite 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8 via RHSA-2018:2372.
*   Mitigation: SELinux can mitigate some, but not all, of the risks.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it could be exploited.
