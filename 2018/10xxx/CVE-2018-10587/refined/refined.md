- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application running on NetGain EM is vulnerable to operating system command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject shell metacharacters to modify commands executed by the server. This leads to arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to compromise of the server hosting the application, the application's data, and functionality. It could also enable the server to be used as a platform for attacks against other systems.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is needed.
