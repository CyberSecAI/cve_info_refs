Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the web interface of D-Link routers, caused by an incorrect fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2017-6190).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The web interface fails to properly sanitize input, allowing attackers to use `..` or `//` in the URL to access files outside of the intended directory. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the router's httpd server processes the "GET /uir" request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read any file accessible by the webserver process on the router's file system, potentially including configuration files, password files, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the router's web interface, specifically using the "/uir" endpoint followed by directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target router.
*   **No authentication is required** to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Devices:**

*   DWR-116 through 1.06,
*   DIR-140L through 1.02,
*   DIR-640L through 1.02,
*   DWR-512 through 2.02,
*   DWR-712 through 2.02,
*   DWR-912 through 2.02,
*   DWR-921 through 2.02,
*   DWR-111 through 1.01,
*   and probably other devices using the same firmware.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is a re-emergence of a previously attempted fix for CVE-2017-6190.
*   The exploit can use `..` or `//` directory traversal techniques.
*   The vulnerability can be chained with CVE-2018-10824 to retrieve the admin password.
