```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization or validation in the `/goform/AdvSetDns` endpoint of the Secutech RiS-11/RiS-22/RiS-33 devices. This allows remote attackers to modify the DNS settings without proper authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a lack of access control on a critical configuration endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to change the DNS settings of the affected device. This can lead to users being redirected to malicious websites, exposed to phishing attacks, served with malicious ads, prevented from accessing important OS and software updates, and potentially infected with additional malware.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/goform/AdvSetDns` endpoint, which includes the desired DNS server addresses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device and know the device's IP address. No authentication is needed, and a simple GET request with the right parameters will trigger the vulnerability."
