  "CVE-2018-10928": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_symlink_req in glusterfs server which allows symlink destinations to point to file paths outside of the gluster volume. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary symlinks pointing anywhere on the server and execute arbitrary code on glusterfs server nodes.",

      "root_cause": "Improper resolution of symlinks in the gfs3_symlink_req RPC request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate validation of symlink paths, allowing symlinks to point outside the designated gluster volume."
      ],
      "impact": "Privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution on the glusterfs server node.",
