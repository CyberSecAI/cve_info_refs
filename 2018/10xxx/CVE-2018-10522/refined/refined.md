{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'file view' operation in the admin dashboard of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) <=2.2.7 does not properly restrict access to files. It uses base64 decoding on the provided filename without proper directory or user permission checks. This allows any ordinary user with access to the admin panel to view the contents of arbitrary files on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of directory restriction"
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive information disclosure. An attacker can read any file content on the server including configuration files with database credentials or other sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific URL containing a base64 encoded file path. This URL is accessed through the admin panel by an ordinary user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid ordinary user account in the CMSMS admin dashboard. The attacker must also know how to form the malicious URL with the base64 encoded file path."
