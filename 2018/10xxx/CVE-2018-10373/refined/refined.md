  "CVE-2018-10373": {
    "description": "binutils: NULL pointer dereference in dwarf2.c:concat_filename() allows for denial of service via crafted file",
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `concat_filename` function within `dwarf2.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted file can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the `nm` application due to a NULL pointer dereference. Specifically, the crash occurs when processing DWARF debugging information due to a missing check for a NULL `line_info_table` pointer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted binary file",
       "Processing a malicious ELF file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted binary file to be processed by the vulnerable `binutils` tool (specifically `nm`)."
