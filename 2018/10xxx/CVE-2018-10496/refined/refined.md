Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10496

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the handling of `TypedArray` objects in the Samsung Internet Browser. Specifically, the browser fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The browser attempts to access a memory location that has been freed, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of object existence validation: The browser does not verify that the `TypedArray` object exists before attempting to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process of the Samsung Internet Browser. This could lead to:
- Complete control over the browser
- Access to sensitive data
- Further compromise of the user's system

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to lure the target user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- The malicious web page or file would trigger the vulnerability by manipulating `TypedArray` objects in a way that leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious website or file.
- The attacker needs to convince the target user to interact with the malicious content.
- No special network position is required beyond delivering the malicious content to the target.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in Samsung Internet Browser version 6.4.0.15.
- The vulnerability was reported to Samsung on 2017-11-05.
- The vulnerability was credited to Tencent Keen Security Lab.
