Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10910:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in BlueZ, where disabling Bluetooth discoverability is not handled correctly in certain scenarios. This could lead to the Bluetooth device remaining discoverable even when it should not be.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of Bluetooth discoverability disabling in BlueZ.
- The `Discoverable` state being reset when turned off, as identified in the patch for `lib/bluetooth-client.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could potentially pair with devices without authorization, even when the user believes Bluetooth discoverability is disabled. This could grant unauthorized access to devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through incorrect state management in the BlueZ Bluetooth stack.
- A remote attacker within Bluetooth range could exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this flaw, as it allows unauthorized pairing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in GNOME Bluetooth by adding a workaround to fix the issue.
- An upstream fix was also merged and may be available in a future release of BlueZ.
- Red Hat indicates that RHEL 7 was not initially affected due to running an older version of GNOME, but was later addressed.
- Mitigation included disabling Bluetooth until the fix was applied.
