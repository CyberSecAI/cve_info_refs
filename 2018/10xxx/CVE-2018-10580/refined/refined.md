{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MyBB Latest Posts on Profile Plugin version 1.1 does not properly sanitize thread subjects when displaying a user's last posts on their profile.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the thread subject, which will be executed when a user views their profile. This could lead to arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker creates a thread with a malicious JavaScript payload in the subject. When a user views their profile, the vulnerable plugin will display that thread subject, executing the attacker's injected script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create a thread on the forum. No specific privileges are required other than being a user capable of creating forum posts."
