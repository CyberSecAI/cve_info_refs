Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10112:

**CVE Description:** The provided text includes the line "(CVE-2018-10112) crash on reading malformed PNG", indicating the CVE relates to a crash when reading a malformed PNG file.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is related to processing a malformed PNG file within the GEGL library. Specifically, the vulnerability appears to stem from how `babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel` handles potentially invalid or unexpected data within the PNG file. This leads to an invalid memory access. There are also other crashes caused by other image file format parsers, like `jpeg_consume_input` when parsing a malformed JPEG file. Additionally, there are memory allocation issues (out-of-memory) when reading crafted image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:**  The `gegl-outbound-write-1` and `gegl-outbound-write-2` PoCs indicate an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to a crash occurring in `memcpy` and `babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel` respectively.
*   **Denial of Service:** The `gegl-dos-1` and `gegl-dos-2` PoCs demonstrate a denial-of-service vulnerability by triggering excessive memory allocation requests, leading to program termination.
*  **Memory Corruption:** The `gegl-dos-3` PoC shows memory corruption due to a crash in `jpeg_consume_input`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:**  The out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities described in `gegl-outbound-write-1` and `gegl-outbound-write-2` could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory with attacker-controlled data, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** The DoS vulnerabilities could cause the application to crash or become unresponsive, impacting availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Image File:** The primary attack vector is providing a crafted, malformed image file (PNG or JPEG) to an application using GEGL.
*   **File Parsing:** Exploitation occurs when the GEGL library attempts to parse this malformed image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious image file as input to an application or service using the vulnerable GEGL library.
*   **No Special Access:** No special privileges or access to the system are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific Function:** The crash occurs in  `babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel` (for the PNG vulnerability), `memcpy` and `jpeg_consume_input`.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Multiple PoCs are available in the provided content (`gegl-dos-1`, `gegl-dos-2`, `gegl-dos-3`, `gegl-outbound-write-1`, and `gegl-outbound-write-2`).
*   **Bugzilla Report:** The Bugzilla report (Bug 795249) confirms the crash on reading malformed PNG.

In summary, CVE-2018-10112 is a vulnerability in the GEGL library related to how it parses malformed image files, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes, memory corruption, and denial-of-service conditions.
