Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10070:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of crafted FTP requests by the MikroTik RouterOS FTP daemon. Specifically, sending a large number of null ('\0') characters at the beginning of an FTP request triggers the issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition in the FTP daemon.
- **Resource exhaustion:** The crafted requests exhaust CPU and RAM.
- **Improper input handling:** The FTP daemon does not properly validate or sanitize the input it receives, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Service disruption:** The affected MikroTik router becomes unresponsive, preventing it from accepting new FTP connections.
- **Reboot:** The router will reboot after about 10 minutes, resulting in downtime. This reboot occurs without a proper shutdown, as indicated by the error message in the logs.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over a network via the FTP protocol.
- **Protocol:** Exploitation occurs by sending specially crafted FTP requests to the vulnerable router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MikroTik device on TCP port 21.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, making it easily accessible.
- **Ability to send crafted packets:** The attacker requires the ability to send arbitrary data to the target's port 21. This could be accomplished with standard tools like `netcat`.
