```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A hard-coded user exists in /etc/passwd on affected WatchGuard AP devices. This allows an attacker to gain access to the device through SSH and the web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Hard-coded credentials",
    "Authentication bypass via HTTP headers",
    "Unintended file upload functionality",
    "Insecure password change mechanism"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as root. Attackers can gain complete access to the device via the web interface, upload and execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending crafted HTTP requests with specific headers (AUTH_USER, AUTH_PASS)",
    "Uploading a malicious file using the hidden 'wgupload' functionality"
  ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. They also need to know the hardcoded credentials."
