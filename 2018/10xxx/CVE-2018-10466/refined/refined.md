Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10466

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   The vulnerability is a **blind SQL Injection** flaw found in **Zoho ManageEngine ADAudit Plus** versions prior to **5.0.0 build 5100**.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability, specifically a blind SQL injection, which means that while an attacker can inject malicious SQL code, the application will not directly reveal the output of the executed queries. The attacker must infer results through other methods, such as timing differences or error messages.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify or delete data, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or the underlying system.
*   Due to the blind nature of the SQL injection, it may take more effort for an attacker to exploit, but the consequences of successful exploitation remain severe.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through malicious SQL code injection via a network.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No specific privileged position seems to be required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated with a high CVSSv3 score of 9.8.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.0.0 build 5100 of ADAudit Plus.
*   The provided content includes links to the vendor's release notes, which confirm the vulnerability and its fix.
*   The advisory highlights that the vulnerability is a "blind" SQL injection, implying that the attacker will not be able to directly see the results of their injection.
