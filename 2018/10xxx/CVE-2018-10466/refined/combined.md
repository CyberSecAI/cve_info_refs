## How to use the best vulnerability alert service?

##### Register

Start your free-forever Vulmon Alerts membership. Registration form is [here](/register).

##### Subscribe

Add your vulnerability queries to the query list on your dashboard, and activate it.

##### Alerted

Get notified with daily emails, instant Slack messages, and API when your queries hit newly
published vulnerabilities.

### Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks. Weekly or monthly vulnerability scanning routines cause long latencies on vulnerability identification. Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners. Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes. [Get Started](/register)

### Vulnerability Alert Subscriptions

Get notifications about
vulnerabilities in your software stack before they are exploited

#### Search Engine Query Subscriptions

It is the fastest way to get notified of newly
published vulnerabilities that are of interest to you.

You can subscribe to any query, including (but
not limited to) vendors, products, vulnerability types, researchers, or a combination of
queries.

When your subscribed queries hit a new
vulnerability, you will get daily emails. If daily emails are not enough for you, other options
include instant Slack notifications, RSS feeds, and API access.

#### Strict Query Subscriptions

It is the best way to get notified about newly
published vulnerabilities if you want to define your subscription strictly based on vendors,
products, and CVSS scores

When your subscribed queries hit a new
vulnerability, you will get daily emails. If daily emails are not enough for you, other options
include instant Slack notifications, RSS feeds, and API access.

Thousands of vulnerabilities are published every year, but few of them attract the attention
of cybersecurity researchers.
The Daily Vulnerability Trends feature informs you of the vulnerabilities being discussed in
the cybersecurity community.

Daily vulnerability trends keep you up to date on the most significant vulnerabilities. This
daily information aids
in your decision-making process on vulnerability assessment and on more strategic decisions,
like product procurement.
