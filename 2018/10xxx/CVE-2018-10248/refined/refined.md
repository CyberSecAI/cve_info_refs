- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF protection when deleting articles in wuzhicms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of the delete request, allowing an attacker to trigger the delete action from a different website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete any article in the wuzhicms by tricking an authenticated administrator into loading a malicious webpage or clicking on a malicious link. This leads to data loss and potentially disruption of the website's content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page (PoC) that an authenticated administrator visits while being logged in to the wuzhicms application. The crafted page uses an image tag to send a delete request, exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a page they control. The attacker does not need direct access to the wuzhicms application.
