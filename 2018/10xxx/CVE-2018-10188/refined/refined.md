Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10188

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure in the `/sql.php` script to properly verify the source of HTTP requests. This lack of proper verification allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application does not adequately protect against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `/sql.php` script doesn't properly validate the origin of incoming requests, allowing for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries through crafted requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the vulnerable database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Database Manipulation:**  An attacker could potentially manipulate the database structure or other settings.
- **Complete database compromise:** A successful SQL injection could lead to a complete compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when clicked by a logged-in phpMyAdmin user, will execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Deception:** The attacker needs to deceive a user into clicking the malicious link. This can be achieved through various methods like social engineering, phishing, or embedding the link on a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The target user must be logged into phpMyAdmin for the attack to succeed.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to get the logged-in user to click on a crafted URL.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious requests.
- **Knowledge of the target phpMyAdmin installation:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the target phpMyAdmin instance and potentially the name of the database they wish to target.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin version 4.8.0.
- The fix is to upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.8.0-1 or newer.
- The provided exploit example uses an HTTP GET request to drop a database as a demonstration.
- The provided Exploit-DB entry confirms the vulnerability and provides a proof-of-concept HTML payload.
