Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `glastopf` application. The application takes a URL as a parameter (in this case, through the `a` parameter in a PHP file), and makes a request to that URL from the server-side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the URL provided by the user before making a server-side request. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers could potentially scan internal networks that are not reachable from the outside world by making the vulnerable server act as a proxy.
- **Access to Internal Services:** They could access internal services running on the network, which are not meant to be exposed to the internet.
- **Attack Other Websites as a Proxy:** As mentioned by the reporter, the vulnerable server could be used as a proxy to attack other websites.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Potentially, attackers could exfiltrate data from internal resources by making the server retrieve the data and forward it to an attacker-controlled endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a URL parameter. Specifically, the reported example is via `abc.php?a=<malicious_url>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to make requests to the vulnerable web application.
- They need to be able to manipulate the URL parameter to include their desired malicious URL.
- There is no need for prior authentication in order to perform this attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content indicates that the developers are aware of this issue and may have implemented some attempt to prevent the SSRF by the presence of 'Internal Server Error' messages. However, it also suggests that this attempt is not completely effective.
- The reporter mentions that they can get logs from other web servers being accessed by the vulnerable server's IP address (192.168.8.123), which confirms the SSRF vulnerability.
- The issue was reported on April 16, 2018.
