## Description

[![@loveraven42](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14023234?u=021adb3708bb404d03c275f961b9f0f57a55c1c3&v=4&size=48)](/loveraven42)[loveraven42](https://github.com/loveraven42)opened [on Apr 16, 2018](https://github.com/mushorg/glastopf/issues/286#issue-314530916)

**My English isn't fluent**

* when I let this program run in my nginx web site, I find it has Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability
* for example , the url is

```
 http://192.168.8.123/abc.php?a=http://****.***.com(the other abnormal web server)

```

and I can get the log from the other web server which this ip（192.168.8.123）visit it.

I know you have do something that prevent it, though I can see `Internal Server Error` from this request `http://192.168.8.123/abc.php?a=http://***.**.com(a normal webserver)`

Maybe the other hackers could use it to attack the other website as a proxy

***My English really is not fluent***

I hope you can understand my means, thanks, bro.
