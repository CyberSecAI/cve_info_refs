Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-10634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information between the Medtronic MiniMed insulin pump and its wireless accessories (MMT-500 and MMT-503 remote controllers).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):**  Communication between the pump and remote controllers is unencrypted, allowing an attacker to intercept and read the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can capture wireless transmissions and extract sensitive information such as device serial numbers.
- This vulnerability is considered to have a high confidentiality impact, but no impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be within the wireless communication range of the devices to capture the transmissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the affected devices.
- A "sufficiently skilled" attacker is required, implying knowledge of wireless communication protocols and the ability to analyze captured data.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to capture wireless communications.

**Additional Notes:**
- This advisory also discusses CVE-2018-14781, which is a separate vulnerability related to capture-replay attacks, where an attacker could replay captured wireless transmissions to cause an insulin bolus delivery. This is related to "easy bolus" and "remote bolus" options on affected pumps when enabled.
- Medtronic has advised users to stop using the remote controllers and disable the remote option on the insulin pumps.
- The advisory also includes general mitigations related to network security for control systems (firewall, vpn, etc)
