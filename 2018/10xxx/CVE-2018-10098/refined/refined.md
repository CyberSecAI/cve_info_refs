Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-10098:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `econceal.sys` driver of MicroWorld eScan Internet Security Suite (ISS) for Business. Specifically, the driver does not properly handle a specific IOCTL request, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of IOCTL requests by the `econceal.sys` driver.
- The driver allows a non-privileged user to send a crafted IOCTL request (0x830020E0) to the `\\.\econceal` device, which can cause a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
- This leads to system unavailability until the system is rebooted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local attack.
- A non-privileged user or a malicious executable running on the system can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker doesn't need administrative privileges, which makes exploitation easier.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on April 17, 2018, and the vendor did not respond, leading to public disclosure on July 12, 2018 after the CVE was assigned.
- The affected software version is eScan ISS for Business v14.0.1400.2029. Other versions may be affected as well.
