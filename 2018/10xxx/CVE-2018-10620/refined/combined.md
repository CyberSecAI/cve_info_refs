# [R1] AVEVA InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Machine Edition Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in **TCPServer.dll** while developing a [Nessus plugin](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/109280) for [CVE-2018-8840](https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-07). To understand the vulnerability a description of the *WSTR* structure in **TCPServer.dll** is useful. The *WSTR* class is used to store wide-character strings:

```

 Class WSTR
 {
 vftable;
 unsigned short lbuf[0x40]; // local storage for the string data
 void *pData; // ptr to string data; can point to @lbuf
 int32 DataLen; // length allocated for @pData
 ...
 };

```

Strings shorter than 0x40 bytes are stored in the *lbuff* array. Otherwise, heap memory is allocated and *pData* and *DataLen* are updated accordingly.

When processing command 81, **TCPServer.dll** tries to read a string into a *WSTR* object. To determine if the string should be stored in *lbuf* or in a heap allocated buffer, **TCPServer.dll** will first read in the string length. The user provided length is incremented by one to account for a null terminator and compared against 0x40. If the *length + 1* is less than 0x40 then the string will be stored in *lbuf*. A remote unauthenticated attacker can abuse this by providing a length of 0xffffffff. When one is added the length rolls over to zero which causes **TCPServer.dll** to try to store the string in *lbuf*. The server will then attempt to copy 0xfffffff bytes into *lbuf* resulting in the following stack buffer overflow:

```

The following commands will recreate the issue:

```

```

### Solution

AVEVA has released updates InduSoft Web Studio Hotfix 81.1.00.08 and InTouch Machine Edition Hotfix 81.1.00.08 to address this vulnerability.

* <https://softwaresupportsp.schneider-electric.com/#/producthub/details?id=5063> (login required)

To identify which version of InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Machine Edition you have installed:

* Windows Desktop or Server operating system: Navigate to Windows Programs and Features, locate the “InduSoft Web Studio” or “InTouch Machine Edition” entries to review the displayed installed version.
* On a Windows Embedded operating system: navigate to the Bin folder in the installation location of InduSoft Web Studio or InTouch Machine Edition and open the file “CEView.ini”. The installed version can be observed from the “version=\*.\*.\*” attribute within the file.

AVEVA’s security bulletin LFSEC00000128 is available at the following location:

[https://sw.aveva.com/hubfs/assets-2018/pdf/security-bulletin/SecurityBulletin\_LFSec128(002).pdf](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sw.aveva.com_hubfs_assets-2D2018_pdf_security-2Dbulletin_SecurityBulletin-5FLFSec128-28002-29.pdf&d=DwMGaQ&c=54IZrppPQZKX9mLzcGdPfFD1hxrcB__aEkJFOKJFd00&r=zE5lG3CZZIbdBvT6slVAzQ&m=YHzOx3IxjROa2Y6TDyoej3F3hX3mODG1x0muH-XoFaA&s=yULjWVgHeseMfsZj9PU5fjfvt1zNBSPWyInIQ39XLiE&e=)

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
