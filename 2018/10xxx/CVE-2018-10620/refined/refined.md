Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-10620:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `TCPServer.dll` component of AVEVA InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Machine Edition. This occurs when processing command 81, where the server reads a string into a `WSTR` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper bounds checking:** The code increments the user-provided string length by one (for a null terminator) before comparing it with 0x40. However, providing a length of `0xffffffff` causes an integer overflow when incremented, resulting in a length of 0. This bypasses the check and causes the code to try storing the string into a small, fixed-size local buffer (`lbuf`).
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** When `TCPServer.dll` attempts to copy a large user-controlled string into the fixed size buffer `lbuf`, it overflows the buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The stack buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, which includes function return addresses. This allows an attacker to potentially redirect program execution and execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to the affected application. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:**  The attacker does not need any prior credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. This usually means the attacker must be on the same network or be able to reach the system through firewalls, VPNs, etc.
- **Knowledge of the protocol:** The attacker needs to understand the specific command (81) and the structure of the data required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `TCPServer.dll`, specifically during processing of command `0x51`.
*   The vulnerability affects InduSoft Web Studio v8.1 and below, and InTouch Machine Edition 2017 v8.1 and below
*   A specially crafted packet includes a length field with value `0xffffffff` followed by the payload to cause overflow.
*   The advisory provides a sample command using `nc` (netcat) to demonstrate how the vulnerability can be triggered, which involves sending a specially crafted byte sequence with a length of 0xffffffff and a long string of 'A' characters.
*   The Tenable advisory mentions that this vulnerability was found while developing a Nessus plugin for CVE-2018-8840.
*   The advisory also mentions that the CVSS v2 base score is 10.0 and the CVSS v3 base score is 9.8

This vulnerability is considered critical due to the ease of remote exploitation and the potential for complete system compromise.
