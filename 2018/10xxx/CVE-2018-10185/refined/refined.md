- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, can add a new administrative user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to create a new administrator account.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, triggers the malicious request to add a new admin user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or clicking on a malicious link to trigger the crafted request.
