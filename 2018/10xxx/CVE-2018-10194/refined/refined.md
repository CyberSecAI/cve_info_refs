  "CVE-2018-10194": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the pprintg1 function of the spprint.c file within Ghostscript. This occurs because of mishandling of PostScript file data during conversion to PDF. The vulnerability is specifically triggered in the `pdf_set_text_matrix` function within `gdevpdts.c`, which calls `pprintg1` with an overly large floating-point value. This can lead to a stack-based out-of-bounds write when processing crafted PostScript or PDF files. The vulnerability can cause a denial of service or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The `pprintg1` function in `spprint.c` uses a fixed-size buffer on the stack. When `pdf_set_text_matrix` calculates text-positioning using extremely large floating-point numbers, the formatted string within `pprintg1` exceeds the buffer, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Improper input validation of floating-point numbers",
      "Insufficient bounds checking before writing to a stack buffer"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a denial of service through a crash (stack smashing), or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted PostScript or PDF file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by Ghostscript. This can be achieved by manipulating the text matrix transformations, leading to large floating point values in position calculations.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create or modify a PostScript or PDF file that can be opened by a vulnerable version of Ghostscript. No specific position is required.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered on page 4 of a 10-page document and has been confirmed using Ghostscript 9.18. The fix involves clamping the rogue value to 0 to prevent the excessively large numbers that cause the overflow. It can also be triggered by a double free condition."
