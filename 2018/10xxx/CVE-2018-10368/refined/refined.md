{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating system announcements. Specifically, it does not properly encode or remove HTML tags in the content section of a system announcement before saving it into the database.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores the malicious JavaScript payload in the database without sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into system announcements. When a user views the announcement, the injected JavaScript will be executed in the user's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions on the user's behalf.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker must first login to the backend administration panel. Then navigate to the 'Extension Module' -> 'System Announcement' section to create or edit announcements. The malicious script can then be injected in the content field of the announcement.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrator-level access to the web application's backend administration panel."
