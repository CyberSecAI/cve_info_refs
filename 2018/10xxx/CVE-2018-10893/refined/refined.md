  "cveId": "CVE-2018-10893",
  "description": "A flaw was found in spice-client. An improper check on LZ images sent by the server could lead to an integer/buffer overflows on the client.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Insufficient encoding checks for LZ compressed frames from the server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious server could cause the client to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "A malicious server sends crafted LZ compressed image data to the client."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker must control the SPICE server."
    }
  ],
  "fixes": [
        "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to ensure that the image type is within the valid range before using it to index into arrays. This prevents out-of-bounds access and potential overflows."
  ],
  "additionalNotes": [
    "The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 via RHSA-2020:0471 and RHSA-2019:2229 respectively.",
        "The fix involves changes in the common/lz.c and common/lz_common.h files."
