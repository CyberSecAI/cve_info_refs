    "description": "Podman before version 0.6.1 does not drop capabilities when executing a container as a non-root user. This results in unnecessary privileges being granted to the container.",
    "affected_component": "podman",
    "fixed_version": "0.6.1",
    "attack_vector": "Local",
    "privileges_required": "None",
    "user_interaction": "None",
    "root_cause": "The podman tool did not properly drop capabilities when running containers as non-root users.",
    "impact": "Containers run as non-root users are granted unnecessary privileges.",

    "resolution": "Clear all caps, except the bounding set, when --user is specified.",
    "vulnerable_code": "Currently we are giving all caps to users when running with podman run --user,\nThey should get none by default.  If the command line includes --cap-add, then\nwe need to run with those capabilties.  Similarly we need to drop caps from\nbounding set, if user specifies --cap-drop"
