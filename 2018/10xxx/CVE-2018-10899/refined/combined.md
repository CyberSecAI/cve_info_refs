| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-13 16:24:16 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Jolokia versions from 1.2. up to and including 1.6.0. Affected versions are vulnerable to a system-wide CSRF. This holds true for properly configured instances with strict checking for origin and referrer headers. This could result in a Remote Code Execution attack.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c4)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-17 18:53:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Martin Bajanik   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c11)  Jonathan Christison    2019-06-20 16:54:02 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://jolokia.org/#Minor_updates_coming_with_1.6.1>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-08 10:08:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0  Via RHSA-2019:2413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2413)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-08 13:18:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10899>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c14)  Joshua Padman    2019-08-12 01:42:31 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:  * JBoss Developer Studio 11  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/node/4027141> for more details.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-17 13:45:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 6.3  Via RHSA-2019:2804 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2804](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2804)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c16)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 06:06:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, jolokia is not enabled by default and, when enabled, the jolokia endpoints do not rely on CORS for security. Therefore, the impact has been reduced to Low and no updates will be provided at this time for the RHOSP jolokia package.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-10-25 12:26:57 UTC  ```  Spring Security OAuth, versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.4, and 2.2 prior to 2.2.3, and 2.1 prior to 2.1.3, and 2.0 prior to 2.0.16, and older unsupported versions could be susceptible to a privilege escalation under certain conditions. A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument.  External References:  <https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15758>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-08 10:08:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0  Via RHSA-2019:2413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2413)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1643048#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-08 13:18:32 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-15758>   ``` |  |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Conversion for TabularData optimized. If any index of an TabularData structure is not a SimpleType, then a direct serialization of the Tabular Data (i.e. an JSON Object with two entries "indexNames" and "values" is created). Otherwise, if it is the representation of an MXBean Map attribute, the map is recreated, otherwise, nested maps are used for simple acces. More on this in the reference manual.

| Fix | Fixed assembly of distribution packages where the JMX and Spring packages were missing. Fixes [84](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/84). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | JS: j4p.register() can now use a 'onlyIfModified' attribute to call the callback only if some changes has happened on the server side. This works currently only for list requests. Fixes [77](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/77). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added the possibility to use the attributes "callback" and "config" in j4p.register() in the JS library. Fixes [78](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/78). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added property errorValue to J4pRemoteException which contains a serialized version of the exception if the 'serializeException' processing parameter is switched on. Fixes [85](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/85). | [marosmars](team-list.html#marosmars) |
| Add | If no host is given, the JVM agent will now bind to localhost. If a host of "0.0.0.0" or "\*" is given, then the agent will listen on all interfaces. Fixes [86](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/86). | [benson-basis](team-list.html#benson-basis) |
| Add | If a port of 0 is given, then the JVM agent will select an arbitrary free port and prints out the selected port. Fixes [82](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/82). | [benson-basis](team-list.html#benson-basis) |
| Add | Added support for "ifModifiedSince" processing parameter. Fixes [77](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/77). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed wrong key order in path when diving into tabular data values. Fixes [83](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/83). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Check whether the Jolokia MBeanServerHolder is registered in advance instead of relying on an InstanceNotFoundException. Fixes [76](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/76). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added BigDecimal and BigInteger converters for input parameters. Fixes [79](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/79). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Fix a bug HistoryEntry.trim() when the list of values is empty and max duration is > 0. Fixes [67](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/67). | [mjr5749](team-list.html#mjr5749) |
| Add | Added enums for serialization/deserialization. It's really surprising how long this missing feature slipped without anybody missing it ;-) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Added additional query parameters (serializeException, canonicalNaming and includeStackTrace) to the set of allowed query parameters for the Java client lib. Fixes [66](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/66). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed URI encoding for GET requests in the JavaScript client library. Fixes [64](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/64). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Added safety net for serialization, so that OutputStreams and Writers are never obtained from get-methods if they declare a subclass as return value. It happens e.g. for Jetty 8.1 that FileResource.getOutputStream() opens a new FileOutputStream nuking the existing data. Nice side effect ;-) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Added new global and process configuration options "includeStackTrace" (true,false,runtime) and "serializeException" (true, false) which can be used to tune the error responses. Fixes [59](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/59). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | "canonicalNaming" option can be as global agent configuration, too. Fixes [59](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/59). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed Glassfish detector which failed to boot AMX in certain circumstances. Fixes [63](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/63). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added support for JSON-MBean. A dedicated @JsonMBean annotation can be used to export complex arguments/attributes/return values as JSON String to the Platform MBeanServer. Jolokia now offers an own MBeanServer as well for registering MBeans which won't show up in any other (exported) MBeanServer (except for the delegation of @JsonMBeans which are delegated and translated). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed issues with GET requests and MBean ObjectNames which end with a "/". Added to integration tests to deal with these issues. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed timestamp in the Java client library's response. | [twhite](team-list.html#twhite) |
| Add | New module "jolokia-spring" with Spring integration for the JVM agent has been added. It contains an own Spring configuration syntax and provides also a plugin for automatic startup the agent with default values by only declaring a dependency (works for containers which automatically lookup META-INF/spring/\*.xml). Kudos to James Strachan for the initial idea. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.6 – 2012-11-26

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Jolokia's JavaScript poller fixes an register/unregister issue, where the returned handle from register() remains stable. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Jolokia JVM agent used with startup options now initializes itself lazily in order to await all the MBeans required for a proper server detection. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | One can now change the key property order for MBeans names with the query parameter "canonicalNaming" for read, list and search operations. By default this is set to "true" in which case an alphabetical ordering for the keys is used. If set to "false", then the original name as registered is used. | [mikael,jstrachan,roland](team-list.html#mikael,jstrachan,roland) |
| Add | Added a method "jobs()" to the JavaScript Jolokia agent to get all handles for all currently registered jobs. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Added GlassfishDetector to the list of detectors for the OSGi Agent. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.5 – 2012-07-23

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | Added a deserialization to javax.management.ObjectName so that attributes of this type and operations taking such an argument can be properly invoked with a Jolokia request. Fixes [JOL-35](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/JOL-35). | [matejj](team-list.html#matejj) |
| Add | Added Jolokia datasource for Cubism (with AMD support). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Jolokia WAR agent initialisation parameters can now be given as servlet context parameters, too. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed regular expression for detecting Oracle Glassfish server | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added specific check for 7.1.x to JBoss Handler since for 7.1 there seems to be an MBean for the version number (contrary to 7.0.x) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.4 – 2012-06-07

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | Allow for custom detector options in the agent's configuration. These options can be evaluated during startup of the agent. The first (and only) option it 'bootAmx' for allowing a Glassfish detector to not boot up the AMX subsystem upon start of this agent. By default (since it is probably needed every time when Jolokia is installed), AMX is booted to provide the most userful information over JMX. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a page showing the Jolokia-Cubism integration including live demos. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a scheduler to the JavaScript client library. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed issue with HTTP method checker for policy based restrictions. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed fallback when registering ConfigMBean which didn't properly work (see pull request #42) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.3 – 2012-04-11

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Fixed issue with Glassfish detector and Jolokia running under gcj | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Added support for AMD in jolokia.js and jolokia-simple.js | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | The history store allows also for time based eviction (JOL-28) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fix for possible NPE when serializing a complex Java objects (#41) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | New configuration property "httpServiceFilter" added for providing a OSGi filter expression which gets applied when selecting the HttpService to bind to. (#39) | [tempredirect](team-list.html#tempredirect) |
| Update | If registering of an ConfigMBean doesnt work because there has been already one be registered with the same name by another agent, a warning is giving out and a UUID is adde to the object name, so startup works as usual. Use either a "mbeanQualifier" or an "httpServiceFilter" in order to avoid naming collisions from the very beginning. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added CORS support for the agents including preflight checks. The policy based restrictor allows for fine grained restriction of cross origin access with a <cors> section. Fixes [JOL-27](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/JOL-27). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Added none-caching headers (cache-control: 'no-cache', pragma: 'no-cache', expires: '-1') to Jolokia's response for all requests. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.2 – 2012-01-06

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update | Verified that javascript client binding works with jQuery 1.7.1 | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Updated Roo plugin for Roo 1.2. It won't work with older Roo versions. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Jolokia's Java client library now can request MBeans via an JSR-160 proxy. This is done either by giving a default proxy configuration to the J4pClient or by providing a proxy config to the request objects. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added support for global and request procession parameter "mimeType" for specifying the HTTP content-type for the Jolokia response. By default this is "text/plain" (but "application/json" can be useful, too). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | In case of an error, the request leading to this error is returned in the response, too. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.1 – 2011-10-31

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Daemonized threads created by the thread pool for the JVM agent. Fixes [37](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/37). | [senthilnest](team-list.html#senthilnest) |
| Add | Added a CollectionConverter for deserializing collections in addition to Maps and Lists. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | The JVM agent know can also take as argument a regular expression for matching a process' name in adition to a process id. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed path access which consists of a single slash (which is the same as no path at all). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 1.0.0 – 2011-10-03

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | Applied patch from codewax for supporting an Equinox HTTP-Service | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Increased test coverage to 80.5%, documented public API to 100% (plus 100% rules coverage, 0% duplications, 0% package tangle index ...). See http://labs.consol.de/sonar/dashboard/index/org.jolokia:jolokia for more information about Jolokia's code metrics. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed problem with URL encoding for GET request with the Java client library, which used to use URLEncoder.encode() and switched now to URI. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724043/http-url-address-encoding-in-java for details. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added processing options for the Java client | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Changed escaping scheme for GET URLs and paths so that a slash (/) can be escaped with an exclamation mark (!): / --> !/ | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Multiple attibutes can be added to GET read requests as a comma separated value list within the URL. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.95 – 2011-08-21

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | Added a dynamical attach mode for the JVM agent launcher (patch by Greg Bowyer). The agent now includes also a client for dynamically starting/stoping an agent on already running Java process. See the reference manual for more information. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Support for upstream serialization of open type, i.e. CompositeData and TabularData. This allows for easy access to MXBeans, which provide support of transparent translation between plain Java objects and collections, which follow some restrictions, to open type data. Jolokia knows how to deal with the fixed format used by this MXBean translation of Maps and transparentrly dispatch this to a JSON map. Initial patch provided by asssaf. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.91 – 2011-05-30

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Fixed issue with overloaded methods where one variant takes no arguments. This no-arg variant can be specified with the signature "()" after the operation name. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added HTTPS support for the JVM agent. In order to switch it on, the property "protocol=https" must be set and additional the properties "keystore" and "keystorePassword" for pointing to the keystore which holds the server side certificate. Client side certificate authentication is switched off currently alway. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed date handling when an MBean exports an attribute as date. It is now returned as an ISO-8601 formatted string, when used with a path "time" the epoch milliseconds are returned. Setting of date values and using dates as arguments for JMX operations is now also supported, the value can be given either in epoch milliseconds or as an ISO-8601 formatted string. With a path "time" a given date value can be even updated for a write operation. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Reworked "list" handling. It's now much faster when used with paths since it doesn't slurp in the whole meta and truncate it afterwards but does the right thing directly to only fetch the required information. The list handler respect now a 'maxDepth' request option for truncating the data from top down. 'maxDepth' works with paths, too. Comprehensive unit tests has been added as well. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added constructor to J4pListRequest() which takes an ObjectName as argument for fetching the meta data for a single MBean only. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.90 – 2011-04-04

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | Added a Knopflerfish detector and tested Jolokia with Knopflerfish 3.1 | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed content-type in javascript library to "text/json" for requests (was "application/x-www-form-urlencoded") | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | A search request will now return an empty list, not an error response with a 404 status code. A null result of a search query is considered to be a valid result, not an error condition. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a OSGi bundle property org.jolokia.listenForHttpService which, if set to false, prevents the automatic registration of a JolokiaServlet to an OSGi HttpService (default: true) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | The activator in jolokia-osgi and jolokia-osgi-bundle can now use an OSGi restrictor service implementing org.jolokia.restrictor.Restrictor when bundle property org.jolokia.useRestrictorService is set to true. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a servlet init parameter "policyLocation" for specifying the location of the policy file. This can be an URL or an string with prefix "classpath:". Default: "classpath:/jolokia-access.xml" | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Refactored restrictor handling and exported org.jolokia.restrictor in the OSGi bundles. JolokiaServlet can take now an Restrictor object as constructor parameter. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Lookup of policy file with the same classloader as used for loading the jolokia classes if lookup failed with context loader added. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | jolokia.js: Works now with jQuery 1.5.1, too (but still doesn't use the advanced Ajax features) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | jolokia.js: Added an HTTP method upgrade to "post" if a proxy target is provided. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | jolokia.js: Add a trailing slash to the Jolokia URL if a "post" request is requested. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Changed protocol in order to support JSON types for return values and write/exec parameters instead of only plain strings as it was before. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.83 – 2011-02-19

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update | Reference Manual updated with sections about the OSGi agent and the new Roo addon. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Jolokia Roo addon added. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a Virgo detector (tested with 2.1) | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added PGP signing for the deployed artifacts | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Introduced org.jolokia.osgi.servlet.JolokiaServlet which gets exported by the jolokia-osgi bundle and allows for programmatic registration of the servlet without the use of an OSGi HttpService. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Update | Update jolokia-osgi-bundle to include Felix's HttpService implementation (since its is a bit smaller and fits better due to the packages already included). Now the bundle can be deployed without dependencies at all on Felix and Equinox. I recommend to use the 'pure' bundle and a given HttpService, though. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed problem for Jetty Detector with Jetty Version < 6.1.4 and made server detection to more conservative so that the servlet starts up nevertheless when an exception occurs during the detection phase (call in the servlet's init method). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Fixed registering of simplifiers, which allows for simplified serialization of well known objects like java.io.File or javax.management.ObjectName | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.82 – 2011-01-16

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update | The HTTP status code returned with a HTTP response does not reflect the status of the JMX operation itself. An HTTP error occurs only if an processing exception (like security constraint violations) happen on the top agent level, otherwise 200 is returned (even when an Jolokia response object contains an error). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a JavaScript client library including about 120 unit tests and a new section in the reference manual. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

### Release 0.81 – 2010-12-14

| Type | Changes | By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix | Fixed MBean registration issue with Websphere AS 7.0 where MBean registration via the MBeanRegistration intefaces causes the WAS MBeanServer to raise a NPE (but register the MBean nevertheless, so no rollback here). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | New request parameter "callback" allows for sending a response as JavaScript function (JSONP). For POST request this parameter must be given as URL parameter and is valid for bulk requests, too. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Security policy can now be globally restricted to a certain HTTP method. Within the <http> section of the policy file, <method> tags define the allowed methods ("get" or "post"). If this section is missing, all methods are allowed. If only one method is given, the other is forbidden. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added an alias for MBean "jmx4perl:type=Config" to "jolokia:type=Config" for backwards compatibility with jmx4perl clients < 0.80 | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Fix | Change HttpClient to a thread safe connection manager by default, extended J4pClient construction with a builder pattern. Fixes [14](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/issues/14). | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a server detection facility (available via the 'version' command) and made 'version' the default command if no command is given in the request URL for a GET request. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |
| Add | Added a "error\_type" key to the Jolokia response in case of an remote exception, which will contain the Java class name of this error. Added getErrorType() to the J4pRemoteException for the Java-Client. | [roland](team-list.html#roland) |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-13 16:24:16 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Jolokia versions from 1.2. up to and including 1.6.0. Affected versions are vulnerable to a system-wide CSRF. This holds true for properly configured instances with strict checking for origin and referrer headers. This could result in a Remote Code Execution attack.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c4)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-17 18:53:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Martin Bajanik   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c11)  Jonathan Christison    2019-06-20 16:54:02 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://jolokia.org/#Minor_updates_coming_with_1.6.1>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-08 10:08:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.4.0  Via RHSA-2019:2413 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2413)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-08 13:18:25 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10899>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c14)  Joshua Padman    2019-08-12 01:42:31 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:  * JBoss Developer Studio 11  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/node/4027141> for more details.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-17 13:45:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 6.3  Via RHSA-2019:2804 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2804](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2804)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1601037#c16)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 06:06:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, jolokia is not enabled by default and, when enabled, the jolokia endpoints do not rely on CORS for security. Therefore, the impact has been reduced to Low and no updates will be provided at this time for the RHOSP jolokia package.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-14 15:27:11 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in FasterXML jackson-databind before versions 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, 2.9.6. A new potential gadget type from MyBatis (<https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3>) has been reported. It may allow content exfiltration (remote access by sending contents over ftp) when untrusted content is deserialized with default typing enabled.   Upstream Bug: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2032>  References: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.8>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c4)  James Hebden    2019-02-20 05:13:25 UTC  ``` OpenDaylight does not use any packages or classes under the org.apache.ibatis (namespace of the MyBatis SQL mapper) and as such is not affected by this. We already have active bugs open to update jackson-databind regardless.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c5)  James Hebden    2019-02-20 05:17:26 UTC  ``` Relevant upstream patch: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/27b4defc270454dea6842bd9279f17387eceb737>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-17 21:01:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2019:0782 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0782](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0782)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-24 18:47:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes  Via RHSA-2019:0877 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0877](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0877)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-08 12:04:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2019:1106 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1106](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1106)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-08 12:09:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2019:1107 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1107](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1107)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-08 12:11:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:1108 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1108](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1108)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-09 18:15:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3.1 zip  Via RHSA-2019:1140 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1140](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1140)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-22 14:53:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Process Automation  Via RHSA-2019:1823 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1823](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1823)   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c33)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-22 14:54:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Decision Manager  Via RHSA-2019:1822 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1822](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1822)   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c37)  Chess Hazlett    2019-07-29 19:14:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since Candlepin's java runtime environment does not load MyBatis classes.  Red Hat Virtualization 4 is not affected by this issue, since it does not include MyBatis classes.  Red Hat Fuse 6 and 7 are not directly affected by this issue, as although they do ship the vulnerable jackson-databind component, they do not enable polymorphic deserialization or default typing which are required for exploitability. Their impacts have correspondingly been reduced to Moderate. Future updates may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c38)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-17 13:45:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 6.3  Via RHSA-2019:2804 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2804](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2804)   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c41)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-27 00:14:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2858 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2858](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2858)   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c42)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-10 12:49:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse Intergration Services 2.0 based on Fuse 6.3 R13  Via RHSA-2019:3002 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3002](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3002)   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c43)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-17 14:55:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8  Via RHSA-2019:3140 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3140](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3140)   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c44)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-18 19:53:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:3149 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3149](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3149)   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c45)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-14 21:18:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.5.0  Via RHSA-2019:3892 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3892](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3892)   ```  [Comment 47](show_bug.cgi?id=1677341#c47)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-02 16:24:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Data Grid  Via RHSA-2019:4037 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4037](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4037)   ``` |  |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-15 18:40:40 UTC  ``` FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the slf4j-ext class from polymorphic deserialization.   References: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2097> <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.7>  Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-15 18:40:51 UTC  ``` Created jackson-databind tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1666416](show_bug.cgi?id=1666416 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14718 jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c10)  Doran Moppert    2019-02-08 05:30:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  This vulnerability in jackson-databind involves exploiting [CVE-2018-1088](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1088) against slf4j, which was fixed in Red Hat products through the errata referenced at <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-8088>. Applications that link only slf4j versions including that fix are not vulnerable to this vulnerability.  Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle slf4j-ext jar.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c11)  James Hebden    2019-02-14 05:18:02 UTC  ``` Even though slf4j in part of OpenDaylight-parent aggregator, the versions included are not vulnerable versions, and specifically the slf4j-ext library is not in use.   ```  [Comment
