Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Arris Touchstone Gateway web administration console does not properly handle session expiration. Even after a user logs out, the `credential` cookie remains valid and can be replayed to perform unauthorized actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613): Session identifiers remain valid even after logout, allowing for replay attacks.
- Improper Authorization: The system does not properly validate session validity, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who has previously sniffed a valid `credential` cookie can:
    - Change the Wi-Fi pre-shared key.
    - Restart the gateway (leading to DoS).
    - Reset the device to factory settings (leading to DoS).
    - Change the administrator username, preventing the legitimate admin from logging in (leading to DoS).
    - Configure, open, and forward ports.
    - Perform any actions that would normally require administrative authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Replay Attack: Reusing a previously captured valid `credential` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have previously sniffed network traffic between the Arris Gateway and an administrator.
- The administrator must have logged into the Arris Gateway web administration console at least once during the sniffing period.
- The attacker can be on the same network (e.g., WiFi) or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The article provides specific examples of how the cookie can be replayed to perform actions such as changing the admin username and restarting the device using `curl` commands.
- The `credential` cookie contains a unique session identifier, but it is not invalidated upon logout.
- The issue exists even after the user has logged out and back in using a new session identifier, as long as the old one was captured.
- The article also references related CVEs:
    - CVE-2018-10991, which is marked as a duplicate of CVE-2018-10990, as it describes the denial of service caused by the lack of session expiration
    - CVE-2018-10989, which describes the cleartext transmission of credentials during login.
