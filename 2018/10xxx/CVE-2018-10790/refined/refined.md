The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10790.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AP4_CttsAtom::AP4_CttsAtom` function when calculating the buffer size, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  Integer overflow: The multiplication of `entry_count` by 8 overflows due to `entry_count` potentially being a large value (e.g., 0x8000000a), which results in a small allocated buffer.
2.  Heap buffer overflow read: After the undersized buffer allocation, a loop attempts to read data from it based on the original, large `entry_count`, leading to an out-of-bounds read, causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service by causing a crash due to the heap buffer overflow. It can also potentially lead to other issues depending on the program execution after the crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file that contains a malicious 'ctts' atom with a large `entry_count` value. The `mp42hls` tool is used to process this file which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to create a malicious MP4 file with a crafted 'ctts' atom. The attacker would then need to get a user to process this MP4 file using the vulnerable application (mp42hls).

**Additional Details:**

The provided content gives detailed information about the vulnerability including:
*   The specific lines of code affected in `Source/C++/Core/Ap4CttsAtom.cpp`
*   Debug information showcasing the integer overflow, where the product of `entry_count * 8` yields a much smaller value than expected.
*   A stack trace and AddressSanitizer error output which clearly shows the heap buffer overflow read exception and its location in the code, thereby confirming the impact of the vulnerability.
