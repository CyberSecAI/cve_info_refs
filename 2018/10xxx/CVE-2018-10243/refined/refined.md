Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10243:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `htp_parse_authorization_digest` function within the `htp_parsers.c` file, which is part of an embedded copy of LibHTP in Suricata.
*   The issue stems from an "unexpected end of Authorization field".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Heap-based buffer over-read. This means the code attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can crash the Suricata service by triggering the over-read.
*   Potential Unauthorized Disclosure of Information: The over-read could potentially expose sensitive data from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted HTTP Authorization field that has an unexpected end during the digest parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running the vulnerable version of Suricata that includes a malformed HTTP Authorization header.
*   The attacker does not appear to need any special privileges or access to the system other than the ability to send the network packet.
