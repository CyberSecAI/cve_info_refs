Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10352

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to construct SQL queries within the `formConfiguration` class of Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** User-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without sanitization or proper escaping. This enables attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software does not adequately validate or sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server. The code is executed under the context of the root user, granting the attacker full system control.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially compromise the entire system, including data, configurations and potentially use the system as a jump point into other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:**  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable input fields or parameters that are used to construct SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Although the vulnerability is stated to require authentication, the advisory also notes that the authentication mechanism can be bypassed, allowing unauthenticated attackers to leverage this vulnerability
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite.
*   Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `formConfiguration` class.
* The CVSS score is 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
