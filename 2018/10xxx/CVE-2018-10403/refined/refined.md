The provided content is related to CVE-2018-10403.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the discrepancy between how the Mach-O loader loads signed code and how third-party code signing APIs incorrectly verify signed code in Fat/Universal binaries. Specifically, the code signing APIs don't check the CA root of trust for nested architectures within a Fat/Universal binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Verification of Nested Architectures:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that code signing APIs verify the first binary in a Fat/Universal file for the CA root of trust, but they do not perform the same check for subsequent nested binaries.
- **Lack of CA Root of Trust Verification:** Code signing APIs, when used improperly by third-party developers, do not verify the CA root of trust for all nested Mach-O files, relying only on TeamIdentifier matching.
- **Preference for Native CPU Architecture:** Code signing APIs prefer to check the native CPU architecture, which can lead to skipping checks on other architectures and executing malicious code.
- **Malformed Fat/Universal File:** The vulnerability requires a specially crafted Fat/Universal binary with a valid Apple-signed Mach-O as the first entry, and a malicious, adhoc-signed binary as a subsequent entry. The CPU_TYPE of the Apple-signed entry must be set to an invalid type or one not native to the host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Code Signing Checks:** Malicious, unsigned code can be disguised as signed by Apple, thus bypassing security tools that rely on code signing verification.
- **Execution of Unsigned Code:** Attackers can execute arbitrary, malicious code by embedding it in a Fat/Universal file and manipulating the CPU_TYPE.
- **Undermining Security Tools:** Security, incident response, and forensics tools that rely on code signing can be undermined and ineffective.
- **Compromised Whitelisting/Antivirus:** Whitelisting solutions can be bypassed, and antivirus products may fail to identify the malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Fat/Universal Binaries:** Attackers create malformed Fat/Universal files that contain a valid Apple-signed Mach-O binary and a malicious binary.
- **CPU_TYPE Manipulation:** The CPU_TYPE in the Fat header of the Apple binary is modified to an invalid or non-native CPU type to force the loader to execute the malicious binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Fat/Universal Files:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a Fat/Universal binary with the specific structure.
- **Ability to Sign Code:** The attacker must be able to ad-hoc sign the malicious code (using `codesign -s -`) for it to be included as a Mach-O in a Fat/Universal binary
- **No Admin Access Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring admin access, JIT'ing code, or memory corruption.
- **Target macOS/OSX:** The vulnerability affects macOS and older versions of OSX.
