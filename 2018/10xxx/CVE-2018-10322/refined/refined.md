  "CVE-2018-10322": {
    "description": "The XFS file system in the Linux kernel did not properly validate inode metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper validation of inode metadata within the XFS file system during mount and operation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `xfs_dinode_verify` function does not properly handle a crafted XFS image, causing an invalid pointer dereference in the `xfs_ilock_attr_map_shared` function.",
        "Missing checks for `di_nextents` in LOCAL data forks, `di_anextents` in LOCAL attr forks, and handling of inodes with no attr fork offset."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (system crash).",
      "attack_vector": "A local attacker can cause a system crash by mounting a crafted XFS image.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to mount a crafted XFS image, either by tricking a legitimate user or by having privileged access."
