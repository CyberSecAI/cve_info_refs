Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the member password reset functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF:** The `/index.php?m=member&v=pw_reset` endpoint, used for resetting a member's password, lacks CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to forge requests that appear to come from a legitimate user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Password Change:** An attacker can force a logged-in user to change their password without their knowledge or consent.
*   **Account Takeover:** By changing the user's password, the attacker can potentially take over the account if they know the username or if it is easy to guess.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page crafted by the attacker, which triggers the password reset.
*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker hosts a specially crafted HTML page containing a form that submits a password reset request to the vulnerable WUZHI CMS application.
*   **Hidden iframe/Image:** The attacker can embed this malicious page in an iframe or an image on a site that the user is likely to visit, without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host or inject HTML content that a legitimate logged-in user will visit/load.
*   The attacker does not need any specific permissions on the target application. The attack leverages the user's existing authenticated session.
*   The user must be logged into the WUZHI CMS application when the attack is initiated.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/index.php?m=member&v=pw_reset`.
*   The exploit uses a simple HTML form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with the new password in the `password` and `password2` parameters. The `submit` parameter is also sent.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) is an HTML page with a form and a hidden script that automatically submits it:

```html
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://localhost/www/index.php?m=member&v=pw_reset" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="yuduo" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password2" value="yuduo" />
      <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="รง&#161;&#174;&#32;รฅ&#174;&#154;" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
*   The exploit uses a fixed password (`yuduo`) in this example.
