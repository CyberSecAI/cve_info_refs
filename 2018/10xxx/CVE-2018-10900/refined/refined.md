Based on the provided content, here's a summary of the CVE-2018-10900 vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Network Manager VPNC plugin. It stems from the ability to inject a newline character into configuration data passed to VPNC. Because of this, a `Password helper` parameter can be injected.

*   **Vulnerability:** Privilege escalation. Specifically, the newline injection vulnerability allows a local user with the ability to modify system connections to execute arbitrary commands as root.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting a newline character into a VPNC configuration parameter (e.g., "Xauth username"), an attacker can insert a "Password helper" option pointing to an attacker-controlled executable. When the VPN connection is initiated, Network Manager executes this attacker-specified "Password helper" script as root.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be local and have privileges to modify a system connection.

*   **Affected Software:** Network Manager VPNC plugin versions prior to 1.2.6.

*   **Fix:** The fix involves disallowing newline characters in configuration values.
