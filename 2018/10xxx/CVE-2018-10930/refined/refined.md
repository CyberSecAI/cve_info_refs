  "CVE-2018-10930": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_rename_req in glusterfs server. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to write to a destination outside the gluster volume.",
    "affected_components": [
      "glusterfs server"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper validation in the RPC request handling of gfs3_rename_req, allowing path traversal during file rename operations.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Path Traversal",
        "Improper Input Validation"
     ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker could rename files to arbitrary locations outside the gluster volume on a glusterfs server node. This could lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with access to modify files on a gluster volume can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RPC request to the glusterfs server to rename files outside the volume's intended boundaries.",
     "additional_information": [
        "The flaw is present in the handling of the RPC request `gfs3_rename_req` in glusterfs server.",
        "Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have sufficient access to modify files on a Gluster volume.",
         "The vulnerability is related to the glusterfs component and not the client itself."
