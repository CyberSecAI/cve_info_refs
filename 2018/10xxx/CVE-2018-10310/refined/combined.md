## Description

* Compliance with **GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive,** and more!
* Customer preference settings and Auto Blocker
* Simple plugin installation + customization options
* Fully supports Google Consent Mode v2 and IAB TCF v2.2

Termly’s GDPR-CCPA Cookie Consent Banner is one of the easiest, most effective, and popular cookie consent plugins available for WordPress. Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) helps businesses comply with data privacy laws from around the world, including the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, all U.S. state-level privacy laws, the UK’s PECR, and more. As a certified Google CMP Gold Partner, our cookie banner also fully integrates with Google Consent Mode v2 and Google Tag Manager (GTM).

Termly’s CMP supports the IAB TCF v2.2 and provides users with a pre-populated list of both TCF Vendors and Google’s Ad Tech Providers, with an option to enter in additional vendors as necessary.

Use our cookie scanner to identify, list, and define all cookies your website uses. Our CMP then creates a custom cookie consent banner and cookie policy for you to easily add to your website.

This Cookie Consent Banner is actively developed, tested, and maintained by a team of engineers, designers, and data privacy attorneys. Termly’s cookie banner and consent solutions receive consistently positive reviews in the industry — from small companies and budding startups to web development agencies, legal offices, and larger enterprises.

Our team works around the clock to ensure you don’t have to worry about your cookie banner or cookie policy while remaining compliant.

#### New in 3.0:

*Now operated by Termly, this plugin includes new features and functions to better help you comply with privacy laws like the GDPR, CCPA and other Cookie Laws like the ePrivacy Directive. Read more here about what’s changed and what it means for you.*

*IMPORTANT: For existing plugin users prior to version 3.0, after upgrading, you will need to sign up for a Termly account from within the plugin, or on app.termly.io, then enable the consent banner again.*

#### KEY FEATURES

* Simple set up — install in seconds
* Automatic cookie scans
* Unique cookie consent banner with customizable features (including text, font, theme, and colors)
* Up to 10,000 monthly unique visitors for free
* Choice of cookie banner position — top or bottom bar, corner tooltip, or full-screen modal
* Regional cookie banner display options (e.g., only display for EU users)

In addition, enable the Auto Blocker to automatically detect, categorize and block tracking scripts on your site from being served to your visitors until they have consented to it in accordance with their local laws and regulations.

## FAQ

### Where can I learn more about this plugin?

To learn more about how this plugin works, visit [the support page](https://help.termly.io/support/solutions/articles/60000666955-how-do-i-install-the-consent-banner-on-wordpress-).

### How does Termly’s plugin help with data privacy legislation compliance?

Laws like the [GDPR](https://termly.io/resources/articles/gdpr-cookies/), UK GDPR, [ePrivacy Directive](https://termly.io/faq/what-is-the-eu-cookie-law/), and UK’s Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations have strict requirements about how websites can use cookies. Termly’s plugin can help you comply with cookie consent requirements, including scanning your site for cookies, gathering user consent, creating a cookie preference center, and more.

### Where can I find out more about the EU and UK laws regarding the use of cookies?

You can find more details about EU and UK regulations like the Cookie Law on the [European Commission’s](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-privacy) site, and the UK’s PECR on the [Information Commissioner’s](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/) Office site. For information about how the GDPR affects your website, visit Termly’s [GDPR guide](https://termly.io/resources/articles/what-is-gdpr/).

### Is the consent banner customizable?

Yes, you can customize your consent banner to match the look and feel of your website. Edit the colors, theme, text, font, display style, and position using our banner settings editor.

### Do visitors need to consent to cookies to use my site?

If you choose to display your consent banner as a top or bottom bar, or as a left- or right-side tooltip, users will be able to continue using your site without interacting with the consent banner. You can also set your banner to disappear when a user scrolls (scroll to consent function). However, if you choose to display your consent notification as a full-screen modal, users will need to interact with the notice before continuing to use your site.

### Will cookies on my site be blocked until a user gives consent to their use?

Yes, if you enable auto-blocking through the plugin, non-essential cookies will be blocked until your site’s visitors have consented to your use of cookies. To learn more about setting up and customizing auto-blocking, [read our developer’s guide](https://help.termly.io/support/solutions/articles/60000688982).

### Is GDPR Cookie Consent Banner free?

The base version of GDPR Cookie Consent Banner is free and includes all of the basic plugin features.

The free plan has a 10,000 monthly unique visitor limit to your consent banner. When that limit has been reached, your banner will be deactivated until the following month. Consider upgrading to a paid plan to unlock additional monthly visitors and access even more features on your consent banner. Visit our pricing page for more information.

This plugin was a very simple, basic plugin doing 1 job and 1 job only. You installed it you knew what you were getting. Now it requires an account on a private company’s API. 0 features without an account.

This dreadful plugin has enabled a bot in robots.txt file. It’s only by searching for the user agent name that I found out in a Wordpress thread that this could be the culprit. Take my advice, delete the files in the database and use another Cookie plugin.

This plugin apparently stopped working months ago – which is bad. But worse – we don’t recall seeing any warning or communication. For months we were relying on a plugin that turned itself off. And of course – we don’t notice because we are not new users. The new free version doesn’t meet our needs and is convoluted – so we have to select and install an alternative.

## Description

* Compliance with **GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive,** and more!
* Customer preference settings and Auto Blocker
* Simple plugin installation + customization options
* Fully supports Google Consent Mode v2 and IAB TCF v2.2

Termly’s GDPR-CCPA Cookie Consent Banner is one of the easiest, most effective, and popular cookie consent plugins available for WordPress. Our Consent Management Platform (CMP) helps businesses comply with data privacy laws from around the world, including the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, all U.S. state-level privacy laws, the UK’s PECR, and more. As a certified Google CMP Gold Partner, our cookie banner also fully integrates with Google Consent Mode v2 and Google Tag Manager (GTM).

Termly’s CMP supports the IAB TCF v2.2 and provides users with a pre-populated list of both TCF Vendors and Google’s Ad Tech Providers, with an option to enter in additional vendors as necessary.

Use our cookie scanner to identify, list, and define all cookies your website uses. Our CMP then creates a custom cookie consent banner and cookie policy for you to easily add to your website.

This Cookie Consent Banner is actively developed, tested, and maintained by a team of engineers, designers, and data privacy attorneys. Termly’s cookie banner and consent solutions receive consistently positive reviews in the industry — from small companies and budding startups to web development agencies, legal offices, and larger enterprises.

Our team works around the clock to ensure you don’t have to worry about your cookie banner or cookie policy while remaining compliant.

#### New in 3.0:

*Now operated by Termly, this plugin includes new features and functions to better help you comply with privacy laws like the GDPR, CCPA and other Cookie Laws like the ePrivacy Directive. Read more here about what’s changed and what it means for you.*

*IMPORTANT: For existing plugin users prior to version 3.0, after upgrading, you will need to sign up for a Termly account from within the plugin, or on app.termly.io, then enable the consent banner again.*

#### KEY FEATURES

* Simple set up — install in seconds
* Automatic cookie scans
* Unique cookie consent banner with customizable features (including text, font, theme, and colors)
* Up to 10,000 monthly unique visitors for free
* Choice of cookie banner position — top or bottom bar, corner tooltip, or full-screen modal
* Regional cookie banner display options (e.g., only display for EU users)
* Translations / multi-language support
* Compatible with Google Consent Mode v2
* Fully supports IAB TCF v2.2 Framework
* Automatic cookie configuration based on our extensive cookie database
* Auto-generated cookie descriptions and cookie categories
* Custom cookie policy

#### SIMPLE SETUP, SCANS AND AUTO-BLOCKING

Termly’s compliance plugin benefits from being one of the easiest and most intuitive compliance tools available. Simply install and activate the plugin, fill in your business info, use our cookie scanner to scan your site for cookies, and customize your settings to get a live cookie consent banner and compliant cookie policy for your website.

In addition, enable the Auto Blocker to automatically detect, categorize and block tracking scripts on your site from being served to your visitors until they have consented to it in accordance with their local laws and regulations. Unlike other tools, Termly maintains a database of thousands of known scripts and trackers so you don’t need to think about set-up and can focus on building your site.

We’ll automatically generate your cookie descriptions and categories. Plus, we’ll keep your notification bar and cookie policy up to date to help ensure compliance. No configuration needed.

## FAQ

### Where can I learn more about this plugin?

To learn more about how this plugin works, visit [the support page](https://help.termly.io/support/solutions/articles/60000666955-how-do-i-install-the-consent-banner-on-wordpress-).

### How does Termly’s plugin help with data privacy legislation compliance?

Laws like the [GDPR](https://termly.io/resources/articles/gdpr-cookies/), UK GDPR, [ePrivacy Directive](https://termly.io/faq/what-is-the-eu-cookie-law/), and UK’s Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations have strict requirements about how websites can use cookies. Termly’s plugin can help you comply with cookie consent requirements, including scanning your site for cookies, gathering user consent, creating a cookie preference center, and more.

### Where can I find out more about the EU and UK laws regarding the use of cookies?

You can find more details about EU and UK regulations like the Cookie Law on the [European Commission’s](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-privacy) site, and the UK’s PECR on the [Information Commissioner’s](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/what-are-pecr/) Office site. For information about how the GDPR affects your website, visit Termly’s [GDPR guide](https://termly.io/resources/articles/what-is-gdpr/).

### Is the consent banner customizable?

Yes, you can customize your consent banner to match the look and feel of your website. Edit the colors, theme, text, font, display style, and position using our banner settings editor.

### Do visitors need to consent to cookies to use my site?

If you choose to display your consent banner as a top or bottom bar, or as a left- or right-side tooltip, users will be able to continue using your site without interacting with the consent banner. You can also set your banner to disappear when a user scrolls (scroll to consent function). However, if you choose to display your consent notification as a full-screen modal, users will need to interact with the notice before continuing to use your site.

### Will cookies on my site be blocked until a user gives consent to their use?

Yes, if you enable auto-blocking through the plugin, non-essential cookies will be blocked until your site’s visitors have consented to your use of cookies. To learn more about setting up and customizing auto-blocking, [read our developer’s guide](https://help.termly.io/support/solutions/articles/60000688982).

### Is GDPR Cookie Consent Banner free?

The base version of GDPR Cookie Consent Banner is free and includes all of the basic plugin features.

The free plan has a 10,000 monthly unique visitor limit to your consent banner. When that limit has been reached, your banner will be deactivated until the following month. Consider upgrading to a paid plan to unlock additional monthly visitors and access even more features on your consent banner. Visit our pricing page for more information.

This plugin was a very simple, basic plugin doing 1 job and 1 job only. You installed it you knew what you were getting. Now it requires an account on a private company’s API. 0 features without an account.

This dreadful plugin has enabled a bot in robots.txt file. It’s only by searching for the user agent name that I found out in a Wordpress thread that this could be the culprit. Take my advice, delete the files in the database and use another Cookie plugin.

This plugin apparently stopped working months ago – which is bad. But worse – we don’t recall seeing any warning or communication. For months we were relying on a plugin that turned itself off. And of course – we don’t notice because we are not new users. The new free version doesn’t meet our needs and is convoluted – so we have to select and install an alternative.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
