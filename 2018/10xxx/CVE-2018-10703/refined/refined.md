  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web interface of Moxa AWK-3121 allows an administrator to run scripts for troubleshooting. However, the POST parameter 'iw_serverip' within the web_runScript functionality is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow in the 'iw_serverip' POST parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve code execution on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to /forms/web_runScript, where the 'iw_serverip' parameter contains a string of 480 characters or more.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. Exploitation can be achieved by tricking an administrator into submitting the malicious request using a Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attack."
