  "description": {
    "description_data": [
      {
        "lang": "en",
        "value": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JPEG images embedded inside U3D files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process."
      }
    ]
  },
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JPEG images embedded within U3D files.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper Input Validation",
    "Out-of-bounds memory access"
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The attack vector involves a remote attacker enticing a user to interact with a malicious webpage or a malicious PDF document that contains a specially crafted JPEG image embedded inside a U3D file."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF document or website and trick a user into opening the document or visiting the page. No specific capabilities are mentioned besides crafting the malicious content.",
   "Affected product": "Foxit Reader",
    "More details": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing JPEG images embedded inside U3D files due to improper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in out-of-bounds memory access."
