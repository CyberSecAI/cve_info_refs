Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `wait4()` system call in the Linux kernel did not properly validate its `pid` argument when the value `INT_MIN` was passed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Handling Error:** The kernel code lacked a check for the specific case of `INT_MIN` (the minimum possible value for a signed integer), which leads to undefined behavior when negated because it cannot be represented as a positive integer within the same signed integer type.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `wait4()` system call did not properly validate the provided process ID (pid).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by triggering the undefined behavior, leading to a system crash.
- The Debian Security Advisory notes that using the invalid `pid` value of `INT_MIN` can lead to "formally undefined behavior" which "might have had a security impact."

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user with the ability to make system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user able to execute system calls, specifically `wait4()`, with a crafted `pid` value of `INT_MIN`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking if the `upid` (process ID) is equal to `INT_MIN`. If it is, the function returns `-ESRCH` (No such process), thus preventing the undefined behavior.
- The code change included a comment indicating `-INT_MIN` is not defined.
- Some of the content discusses the general problem of `-2147483648` in C, particularly the edge case where negating `INT_MIN` results in undefined behavior. This is directly relevant to the vulnerability as it highlights the underlying issue the patch is fixing.
- The provided information goes into detail on the specific code changes and includes a discussion on `INT_MIN` behavior in C.

This analysis is based on the provided content, which includes commit logs, Ubuntu security notices and a discussion on the problem of  `-2147483648` in C.
