The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Frog CMS version 0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization when processing the "Name" field within the "Edit layout" functionality. The application does not properly encode or validate user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code is persistently stored in the application's database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user accesses the affected page, the stored JavaScript payload is executed within their browser context.
- This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Deface the website
    - Potentially gain administrative access if an administrator is targeted

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user can inject the XSS payload by editing a layout's "Name" field via the administration panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges within the Frog CMS to access the "layouts" and "Edit layout" functionality and modify the layout's name field.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit uses the following payload: `</textarea>"/><script>confirm(1234)</script><textarea>`. This payload breaks out of the `textarea` context and injects a `<script>` tag that executes `confirm(1234)`.
The attacker can then replace the `confirm(1234)` with other malicious code.
The HTTP POST request demonstrates how the payload is injected into the `layout[name]` parameter when editing the layout.
