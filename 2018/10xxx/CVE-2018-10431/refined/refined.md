  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'Traceroute' function of the D-Link DIR-615 router's web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the router, allowing an attacker to potentially gain full control of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting shell commands into the host input field of the 'Traceroute' function, through the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface and be authenticated as an administrator."
