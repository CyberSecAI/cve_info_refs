- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The product UI does not adequately warn users of unsafe actions, specifically allowing authorized users with privileged access to issue SQL commands that can corrupt or lose data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper restriction of operations within the application. Specifically, DB Manager, ReadA Overview, and PerformA applications do not prevent authorized users from issuing arbitrary SQL commands via the user interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to data corruption or loss of data.
- **Attack vectors**: An authorized user with a privileged account can use the vulnerable application interfaces to execute SQL commands
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authorized user with privileged access to the BD Kiestra system and must have adjacent network access.
