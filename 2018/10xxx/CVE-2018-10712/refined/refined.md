- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ASRock drivers (AsrDrv101.sys and AsrDrv102.sys) expose functionality to read and write data to IO ports through IOCTL codes. These IOCTLs can be accessed by non-privileged user processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control on the exposed IOCTLs for port mapped I/O access, which allows non-privileged users to interact with them.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read and write arbitrary data to IO ports, potentially leading to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service. The provided proof of concept demonstrates a system reboot by writing to the specified I/O ports, showcasing the impact of the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. A non-privileged user can send crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the machine with the vulnerable ASRock drivers installed. They must be able to execute code as a non-privileged user.
