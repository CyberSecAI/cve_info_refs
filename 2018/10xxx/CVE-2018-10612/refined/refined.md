- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User access management and communication encryption are not enabled by default in CODESYS Control V3 products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Access Control (CWE-284). The lack of default user access management and encryption allows unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data, including user credentials. This could lead to complete compromise of the device, data manipulation, and potential disruption of critical infrastructure processes.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected device, no special privileges or user interaction is required. The vulnerability is considered low skill to exploit.
