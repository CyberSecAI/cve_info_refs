Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10230

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the Zend Debugger module's failure to properly encode user-controlled data, specifically the `debug_host` parameter, before including it in error messages. This occurs during hostname resolution and connection attempts, as well as host allow/deny checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue. The debugger includes user-supplied input in server responses without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when visited by a user, execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If the victim is authenticated to the website (e.g., via cookies), the attacker can perform actions on the website on behalf of the user.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Even if the user is not authenticated, the attacker can use the XSS to perform phishing attacks and steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious code into the `debug_host` parameter of a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered without any prior authentication, so the attacker does not need any credentials.
*   **Zend Debugger Module Enabled:** The Zend Debugger module must be loaded and enabled on the target server.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing the crafted URL for exploitation to occur.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Zend Debugger versions bundled with Zend Server 9.0.1 up to 9.1.3 and up to 8.5.9.
*   The vulnerability does not seem to exist in production mode.
*   Zend Server 8.5.9 and 9.1.3 bundle a fixed version of Zend Debugger.
*   The vulnerable code is present in `zend_debugger_lookup_hostname`, `zend_debugger_check_ip_allowed` and `zend_match_host_masks` functions.
*   The `debug_host` parameter is used in the error messages when hostname resolution fails, connection fails or when the host is not allowed.
