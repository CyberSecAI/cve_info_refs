Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a combination of an authentication bypass in the `.srv` functionality and a command injection flaw in the `parhand` component of Axis network cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The `.srv` functionality has an authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to access it without proper credentials.
2.  **Command Injection:** The `parhand` component is vulnerable to command injection. This means that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system through parameters processed by the `parhand` component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected Axis devices with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing the attacker to perform any action they desire, including but not limited to:
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Modifying device settings
    - Using the device as a bot in a botnet
    - Disrupting normal functionality

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Exploitation is achieved through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/index.html/<random>.srv` endpoint.
- **DBUS calls:** The attacker uses the DBUS interface to call the `set_param` method of the `com.axis.PolicyKitParhand` service and inject a command into the `root.Time.DST.Enabled` parameter. Followed by `SynchParameters` method to execute the command

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device.
- **No Credentials Required:** No prior authentication or valid user credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Internet Facing Devices at High Risk**: Devices exposed directly to the internet are at higher risk

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit leverages the ability to execute commands via the `parhand` service using the `set_param` DBUS method by injecting it in `root.Time.DST.Enabled` parameter.
- The exploit uses the `synch_params` method to execute the previously injected command.
- This vulnerability has been assigned multiple CVEs: CVE-2018-10660, CVE-2018-10661 and CVE-2018-10662.
- The exploit was discovered by VDOO and a Metasploit module is available for its exploitation.
- Patches for this vulnerability are available, and it is strongly recommended to update affected devices to the latest firmware.
