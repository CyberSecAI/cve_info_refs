Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-10823:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Sip` parameter within the `chkisg.htm` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Shell command injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the router, gaining full control over the device internals.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Requires an authenticated session on the router web interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated on the router's web interface.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `chkisg.htm` page, injecting shell commands into the `Sip` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the following D-Link router models:
    - DWR-116 through 1.06
    - DWR-512 through 2.02
    - DWR-712 through 2.02
    - DWR-912 through 2.02
    - DWR-921 through 2.02
    - DWR-111 through 1.01
- The attacker injects a shell command via the `Sip` parameter. Example: `http://routerip/chkisg.htm%3FSip%3D1.1.1.1%20%7C%20cat%20%2Fetc%2Fpasswd` which executes the command `cat /etc/passwd` on the router's shell.
