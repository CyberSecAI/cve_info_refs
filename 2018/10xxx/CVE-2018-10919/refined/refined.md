Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-10919:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Samba LDAP server had missing access control checks when handling custom LDAP attributes. Specifically, the `searchFlags` confidential flag on custom attributes was not properly enforced, allowing unauthorized access to attribute values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is an information disclosure flaw. Although Samba recognizes the `searchFlags` confidential flag and attempts to hide attributes from non-admin users, the values can still be discovered using brute-force substring search queries via LDAP.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access controls for confidential attributes when processing LDAP search queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated attacker can extract confidential attribute values. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information that should be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the Samba LDAP server.
*   Attackers would use specially crafted LDAP search expressions, including wildcard searches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Samba server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Samba when acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller.
*   The issue can be exploited by brute-forcing the attribute values one character at a time with wildcard search queries.

The provided content also mentions that the vulnerability was fixed in Samba versions 4.6.16, 4.7.9, and 4.8.4.
