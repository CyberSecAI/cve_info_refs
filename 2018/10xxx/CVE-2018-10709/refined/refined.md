```
{
  "CVE-2018-10709": {
    "Root cause": "The ASRock drivers (AsrDrv101.sys and AsrDrv102.sys) expose functionality to read and write CR register values through IOCTL codes without sufficient access control.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control [CWE-782]"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read and write CR register values, which can ultimately lead to code execution with elevated privileges.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can send IOCTL codes to the vulnerable driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to interact with the driver."
  }
