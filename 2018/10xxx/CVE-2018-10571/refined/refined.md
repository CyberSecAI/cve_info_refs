  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in the output of the web page, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript code into the page, leading to actions being performed on behalf of the logged in user. This could include data manipulation or account takeover.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript payload in the `patient` parameter is sent to a logged-in user."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and have a logged-in user click it.",
    "details": "The `finder_navigation.php` script in OpenEMR version 5.0.0 does not sanitize the `patient` GET parameter, which is then reflected in the HTML of the page within an input textbox's value attribute. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Javascript code by manipulating this parameter in a crafted URL."
