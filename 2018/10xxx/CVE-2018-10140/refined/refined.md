- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the PAN-OS Management Web Interface. Specifically, malformed search parameters sent through the Filter bar.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper Input Validation (CWE-20), leading to a Denial of Service.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An authenticated user can shut down all management sessions, forcing all logged-in users to be redirected to the login page, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, sending malformed search parameters to the PAN-OS Management Web Interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PAN-OS management interface.
