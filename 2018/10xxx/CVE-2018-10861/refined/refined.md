The content directly mentions CVE-2018-10861 in the following contexts:

*   **SUSE Advisory:** The SUSE security advisory for CVE-2018-10861 details a flaw in Ceph MON, where it does not properly perform authorization on OSD pool operations. This is a direct match to the CVE description: "ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops."
*   **Red Hat Advisory:** Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA-2018:2177, RHSA-2018:2179, RHSA-2018:2261 and RHSA-2018:2274) indicate that a fix for CVE-2018-10861 is included in the respective updates.
*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2018-10861 also describes the same issue: "ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops".
*   **openSUSE Advisory:** The openSUSE Security Advisory mentions that CVE-2018-10861 is fixed in a security update for ceph.
*   **Debian Security Advisory:** The Debian Security Advisory states the ceph-mon did not validate capabilities for pool operations, corresponding to CVE-2018-10861, and that a fix was included in the update.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of authorization checks in Ceph Monitor (`ceph mon`) when handling requests related to OSD pool operations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated Ceph users with read access can bypass intended authorization controls related to OSD pools.
    *   **Potential for Data Corruption or Deletion:** Due to the lack of proper validation of user capabilities, attackers can potentially delete, create, or corrupt snapshot images, and even delete Ceph storage pools.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Integrity:**  An attacker with read access can corrupt snapshot images.
    *   **Availability:**  An attacker with read access may delete Ceph storage pools.
    *   **Confidentiality** is not directly impacted by the vulnerability. However, loss of data availability may cause indirect confidentiality impacts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ceph cluster.
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker requires a valid Ceph user account with at least read access to the Ceph cluster.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be authenticated to the Ceph cluster.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the Ceph Monitor.
    *   The attacker needs to have at least read permissions.
*  **Mitigation:** Disable pool deletion via setting  `mon_allow_pool_delete = false` in ceph.conf and also set `ceph osd pool set <pool> nodelete true`.
* **Upstream Fix:**  The upstream fix is implemented in Ceph versions 10.2.11, 12.2.6, and 13.2.1.

**3. Additional Technical Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   The vulnerability involves a flaw in how Ceph Monitor handles user requests for OSD pool operations, which are used for managing unmanaged snapshots or even deleting pools.

**4. Summary of Content:**

The provided documents consistently describe a vulnerability (CVE-2018-10861) where authenticated ceph users with read privileges could perform actions they should not be able to do with OSD pools. This could lead to deletion or corruption of snapshot images or even ceph storage pools. The documents list the vulnerable ceph versions and the fix versions. Some documents also contain mitigations.

Based on this information, the provided content is indeed relevant to CVE-2018-10861, and gives detailed information of the vulnerability.
