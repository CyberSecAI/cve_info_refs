| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1610640#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-01 05:29:33 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  All versions of Samba from 4.7.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of service attack which can crash the "samba" process when Samba is an Active Directory Domain Controller.  Missing database output checks on the returned directory attributes from the LDB database layer cause the DsCrackNames call in the DRSUAPI server to crash when following a NULL pointer.  This call is only available after authentication.  There is no further vulnerability associated with this error, merely a denial of service.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1610640#c2)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-16 03:39:27 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-10918.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1610640#c3)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-16 07:13:22 UTC  ``` Created samba tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1617910](show_bug.cgi?id=1617910 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-10918 samba: DsCrackNames on a user without an SPN can trigger NULL-pointer de-reference [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1610640#c5)  Huzaifa S.

# USN-3738-1: Samba vulnerabilities

14 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Samba.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [samba](/security/cves?package=samba) - SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix

## Details

Svyatoslav Phirsov discovered that the Samba libsmbclient library

incorrectly handled extra long filenames. A malicious server could use this

issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10858](/security/CVE-2018-10858))

Volker Mauel discovered that Samba incorrectly handled database output.

When used as an Active Directory Domain Controller, a remote authenticated

attacker could use this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

([CVE-2018-10918](/security/CVE-2018-10918))

Phillip Kuhrt discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled

certain confidential attribute values. A remote authenticated attacker

could possibly use this issue to obtain certain sensitive information.

([CVE-2018-10919](/security/CVE-2018-10919))

Vivek Das discovered that Samba incorrectly handled NTLMv1 being explicitly

disabled on the server. A remote user could possibly be authenticated using

NTLMv1, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. ([CVE-2018-1139](/security/CVE-2018-1139))
