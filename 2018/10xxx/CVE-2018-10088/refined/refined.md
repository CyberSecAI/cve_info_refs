Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-10088:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the XiongMai uc-httpd version 1.0.0 web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs in the processing of the `username` field within a POST request to the `/login.htm` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) crashes the `Sofia` process, which hosts multiple services including the vulnerable web server. This effectively leads to a denial of service condition.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The information suggests a high potential to escalate the vulnerability to full remote code execution with root privileges, given the context that the `Sofia` process runs as root on the tested DVR.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/login.htm` endpoint, specifically by overflowing the `username` parameter.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through a web camera viewer interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the target device running the vulnerable uc-httpd server.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be triggered by unauthenticated users since the overflowing occurs in the login form.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests.
- **Target Identification:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target DVR and its running uc-httpd service on TCP port 81 as in the PoC

**Additional Information:**
- The affected product is Xiongmai's `uc-httpd` version 1.0.0.
- The vulnerable component is the handling of POST requests to the `/login.htm` endpoint with the `username` field.
- The PoC uses a buffer of 85 bytes (the 'A' * 85 payload).
