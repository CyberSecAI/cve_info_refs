Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2018-10865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `redhat-certification` component lacks proper authorization checks for the `/configuration` view. This allows unauthenticated users to call the "restart" RPC method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authorization checks before allowing access to the restart functionality via the RPC method.
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  An unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote Code Execution (Implied):** The ability to restart the RHCertD daemon on any accessible host can be leveraged to potentially cause a denial of service, as well as possibly cause other unpredictable behavior on the target system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Restart:** An attacker can restart the RHCertD daemon on any host accessible to the vulnerable system. This could interrupt services and cause instability.
- **Potential Denial of Service:** Repeated restarts could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Cross Customer Impact:** An attacker could restart the RHCertD daemon on systems belonging to other customers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable `redhat-certification` component.
- **RPC Method Call:** The attacker calls the "restart" RPC method on the `/configuration` view.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the system on which the vulnerable `redhat-certification` service is running and be able to access port 8009.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Riccardo Schirone of Red Hat Product Security.
- The issue was fixed, and the bug report is closed with an errata.
