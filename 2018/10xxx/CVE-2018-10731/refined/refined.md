Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-10731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow caused by improper handling of long cookies within the web interface of the affected Phoenix Contact FL switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** A buffer on the stack is overflowed when processing a long cookie in a GET request, overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the switch's operating system files.
*   Attackers can insert and execute arbitrary code within the OS, potentially leading to:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
    *   Compromise of the switch's integrity.
    *   Further exploitation of the managed FL switch.
    *   Complete control over the device.
*   The attacker may also be able to deny switch network access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted, long cookie within an HTTP GET request to the web interface of the affected device.
*   The attack vector is network-based, allowing for remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable switch's web interface.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user interaction or authentication (though the cert.vde.com document does not exclude this)
* The ICS-CERT advisory mentions the vulnerability is exploitable with low skill level.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Phoenix Contact FL SWITCH 3xxx, 4xxx, and 48xx series devices running firmware versions 1.0 to 1.33.
*   The vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2018-10728, although both are related to buffer overflows and are present in the same devices.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 9.0, with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Vyacheslav Moskvin and Semen Sokolov (and others) of Positive Technologies to PHOENIX CONTACT.
