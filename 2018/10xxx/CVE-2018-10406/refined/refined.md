Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-10406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of code signing checks by third-party developers using the macOS code signing APIs. Specifically, the issue lies in the insufficient verification of nested Mach-O binaries within Fat/Universal files. While the code signing API checks the cryptographic signature of the first binary, it fails to properly validate the CA root of trust for subsequent binaries in the same file, leading to a bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Verification of Nested Binaries:** The primary weakness is the failure to verify the code signature and CA root of trust of all architectures within a Fat/Universal binary.
*   **Reliance on First Binary Verification:** Code signing APIs primarily validate the first binary in a Fat/Universal file, then perform limited checks on subsequent binaries without checking the CA root of trust
*   **Preference for Native Architecture:** The code signing API favors the native CPU architecture for code signing checks, defaulting to checking unsigned code if it's the native architecture (e.g., x86_64), but allowing i386 when x86_64 is present and the CPU_TYPE is not native.
*   **Lack of Strict Validation:** The API lacks strict validation by default. Developers must manually check each architecture, verify identities, and ensure cryptographic integrity.
*   **Team Identifier Issue:** Ad-hoc signed binaries have "TeamIdentifier=not set," which matches core Apple-signed binaries, making the Team Identifier check insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Code Signing Checks:** Attackers can bypass code signing checks by crafting malicious Fat/Universal files with a validly signed (e.g., by Apple) first binary and a malicious, ad-hoc signed second binary.
*   **Execution of Malicious Code:** By manipulating the CPU\_TYPE in the Fat header to be an invalid or non-native CPU type, the macOS loader skips over the legitimate code and executes the attacker-controlled binary, even though the overall file is deemed "valid" by vulnerable security tools.
*   **Undermining Security Tools:** Security tools relying on code signing for whitelisting, antivirus, incident response, and threat hunting can be circumvented, allowing malicious code to execute undetected.
*   **Compromise of Security and Forensics Processes:** By subverting code signing, an attacker can potentially hinder incident response and forensics investigations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Fat/Universal Files:** Attackers create a malicious Fat/Universal file that includes:
    *   A validly signed (e.g., by Apple) Mach-O binary as the first entry.
    *   A malicious, ad-hoc signed Mach-O binary as a subsequent entry, usually with an i386 architecture for x86\_64 target systems.
    *   A manipulated CPU\_TYPE field in the Fat header to force the execution of the malicious binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Fat/Universal Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create and modify Fat/Universal files and ad-hoc sign them.
*   **No Admin Access Needed:** This vulnerability does not require administrative privileges or memory corruption to bypass code signing checks.
*   **Knowledge of Fat/Universal File Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the Fat/Universal binary format and the Mach-O loader.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   **Specific API functions involved:** The blog post mentions `SecCodeCheckValidity` and how it's improperly used, and how third party developers need to use `SecRequirementCreateWithString` with the requirement "anchor apple" then `SecStaticCodeCheckValidity` with additional flags such as `kSecCSDefaultFlags | kSecCSCheckNestedCode | kSecCSCheckAllArchitectures | kSecCSEnforceRevocationChecks`.
*   **Affected software:** The content lists specific vendors and software affected, including VirusTotal, Google Santa, Facebook OSQuery, Objective Development LittleSnitch, F-Secure xFence, Objective-See tools, Yelp OSXCollector, and Carbon Black Cb Response.
*   **Workarounds/Mitigations:** The blog post explains how to use `codesign` with the `-R='anchor apple'` flag or the `generic` flag to verify code signatures correctly using the command line, and describes the API calls and flags developers need to use when checking code signatures in their applications.
