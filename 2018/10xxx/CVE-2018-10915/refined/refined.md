## Analysis of CVE-2018-10915

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-10915:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The content from multiple sources clearly relates to CVE-2018-10915, with descriptions aligning with the provided CVE description. The vulnerability lies within the `libpq` client library of PostgreSQL.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `libpq` library fails to properly reset its internal state between connection attempts. Specifically, a state variable determining whether a password is needed for a connection is not reset.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper state reset:** `libpq` does not adequately reset internal state variables, specifically ones that determined if a password is required.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing client-side security features:** An attacker can bypass client-side security checks by manipulating connection parameters (e.g. host or hostaddr).
*   **Access to higher-privileged connections:** Attackers may gain access to connections that are supposed to be protected, possibly using server-side credentials without authorization. This particularly affects users of `dblink` and `postgres_fdw`.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can cause `PQescape*()` functions to malfunction, allowing SQL injection, particularly within "postgres_fdw" and other applications that utilise libpq.
*   **SSL/TLS bypass:** Attackers can cause `sslmode=prefer` to not attempt SSL/TLS at all.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
*   **Untrusted connection parameters:** Attackers need to control or influence the `host` or `hostaddr` connection parameters provided to a PostgreSQL client application using libpq.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to communicate with a system using the vulnerable `libpq`.
*   **Control of connection parameters:** The attacker must be able to provide or influence the `host` or `hostaddr` connection parameters used by a PostgreSQL client application.
*   **Low privilege:** The attacker needs only low-level privileges for some exploits.

**Additional Details from Content**

*   **Specific functions affected:** The content identifies `PQconnectionUsedPassword()` and the `PQescape*()` family of functions as being impacted.
*   **Affected modules:**  The `dblink` and `postgres_fdw` contrib modules are specifically mentioned as exploitable use cases.
*   **Upstream fix:** The upstream fix involves a commit to reset connection state variables.
*   **Red Hat products affected:** The Red Hat content mentions several Red Hat products and software collections affected by this vulnerability, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Software Collections, Red Hat Virtualization, and CloudForms Management Engine.
*   **SUSE products affected**: The SUSE content lists SUSE Enterprise Storage, SUSE Linux Enterprise, SUSE OpenStack Cloud, and several openSUSE versions.
*   **Ubuntu Products affected**: Ubuntu 18.04 ESM, Ubuntu 16.04 ESM, and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM are listed as affected, mentioning specifically the `postgresql-10`, `postgresql-9.5`, and `postgresql-9.3` packages.
*   **OpenSUSE details:** openSUSE mentions packages for Leap 15.0, 15.1, 15.2, and Tumbleweed are affected.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper state reset in `libpq` between connections.
*   **Weakness:** Failure to reset crucial connection state variables.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing client security features, gaining unauthorized access, SQL injection, SSL/TLS bypass, potentially memory disclosure (through CVE-2018-10925).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network, untrusted `host`/`hostaddr` parameters.
*   **Capabilities:** Network access and ability to influence connection parameters, low privileges sufficient for some exploits.
*   **Affected Software:** PostgreSQL versions prior to 10.5, 9.6.10, 9.5.14, 9.4.19, and 9.3.24, plus numerous Linux distributions that ship these versions.
