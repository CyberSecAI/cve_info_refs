  "CVE-2018-10904": {
    "description": "It was found that glusterfs server does not properly sanitize file paths in the \"trusted.io-stats-dump\" extended attribute which is used by the \"debug/io-stats\" translator. An attacker can use this flaw to create files and execute arbitrary code. To exploit this an attacker would require sufficient access to modify the extended attributes of files on a gluster volume.",
