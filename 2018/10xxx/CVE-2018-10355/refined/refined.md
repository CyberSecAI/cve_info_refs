**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-10355

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `DBCrypto` class of the Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway product.
- User passwords are not securely stored; they are stored in a recoverable format.
- A hard-coded key is used for encryption, which allows decryption if the key is obtained.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a hard-coded key for password encryption.
- Storing passwords in a format that can be easily decrypted with the key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can recover user passwords.
- This allows unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially other sensitive data protected by these credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers need to gain access to the user database on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
- Once they have the database, they can use the hardcoded key to decrypt the stored passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers must have access to the user database of the Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway.
- No specific network position is mentioned, but access to the database is critical for exploitation.
