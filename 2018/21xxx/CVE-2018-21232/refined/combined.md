# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: re2c: infinite loop

Hello all,

re2c is affected by an infinite loop.

It was initially discovered by Sergei Trofimovich (slyfox) and reported by me
privately to upstream.
The upstream reference is at: <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/issues/219>
There is no CVE assigned.

Here is the additional upstream comment:

I fixed enough recursive functions to make the ASAN-instrumented re2c
pass on this file (but that doesn't fully fix #219, as some other
recursive functions still need rewriting, work in progress).
This is the list of fixes:
fd634998f813340768c333cdad638498602856e5 Rewrite recursion into iteration
(Tarjan's SCC algorithm and YYFILL states).
637d4e468835690eac102aba83535dfd26afbbdb Rewrite recursion into iteration
(paths for -Wundefined-control-flow).
e3e43bcbb746dd6692f2d60ed1fa2e26c8cbe987 Rewrite recursion into iteration
(skeleton max path length computation).
f39b522cd40d04e80b77db926ce2d7d766954852 Rewrite recursion into iteration
(insertion of negative tags in RE).
They will appear in the next release, re2c-2.0.

Agostino
