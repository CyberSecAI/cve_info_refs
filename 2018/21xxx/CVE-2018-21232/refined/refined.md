Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21232:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is an infinite loop issue within the `re2c` code, specifically triggered during processing certain inputs, which leads to a denial-of-service. The issue was initially discovered due to a stack overflow caused by excessive recursion but was later revealed to be an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Infinite loop in the code due to excessive recursion which was later addressed with iterative solutions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the `re2c` tool to enter an infinite loop, consuming system resources (CPU, memory) and ultimately making the system unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is by providing a specially crafted input to the `re2c` tool that triggers the infinite loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `re2c` tool, such as supplying a specially crafted `.re` file to the re2c compiler.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was initially reported as a stack overflow due to excessive recursion, but the root cause is an infinite loop. The developers have addressed the recursion issue by replacing recursive functions with iterative ones in later commits. The specific functions involved include: Tarjan's SCC algorithm and YYFILL states, paths for -Wundefined-control-flow, skeleton max path length computation and insertion of negative tags in RE.
- The vulnerability was reported privately and has a corresponding Github issue:  <https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/issues/219>
- The content indicates that the fix has been implemented and will be included in re2c version 2.0
