## Description

RSVPMaker is an event and email marketing tool. Use PayPal or Stripe to collect event payments. RSVPMaker handles scheduling, event marketing, and RSVP tracking. You can send email to small lists through your web server or take advantage of the integrations with Postmark and Mailchimp to scale up.

When implemented in combination with Postmark for reliable email delivery, RSVPMaker can function as an alternative to Mailchimp or MailPoet that allows you to format messages in the WordPress editor and easily incorporate events (for invitations) and blog posts or excerpts from posts (for email newsletters and promotions).

Use RSVPMaker to:

– Schedule and promote events of all sorts: conferences, classes, seminars, speaking events, parties and weddings are a few common uses.

– Register attendees, prompting them to enter whatever information you need, including the names of guests.

– Collect money using PayPal or Stripe.

– Create webinars and other online events leveraging free resources like the YouTube Live service.

– Create, format, and edit email newsletters within the WordPress block editor, rather than learning another content composer tool. Use dynamic blocks or shortcodes to incorporate dynamic content like lists of recent blog posts or upcoming events.

– Power membership-oriented websites with tools for emailing all your members or just those who have or have not registered for a specific event.

– Send email using your own web server, an SMTP plugin or the integrations with Mailchimp and Postmark.

– Postmark integration has the advantage of supporting both broadcast / mailing list and transactional messages (like RSVP Confirmations).

### Creating and Managing Events

RSVPMaker events are created and edited just like blog posts in the WordPress editor, with the addition of parameters like event date (so the items can be listed chronologically and displayed on a calendar grid).

You can use RSVPMaker for event announcements, or turn on the Collect RSVPs function and set additional options for sending email notifications, customizing confirmation and reminder messages, and setting a price or prices if you will be requesting online payments via PayPal.

RSVP reports can be viewed on the administrator’s dashboard or downloaded as spreadsheets.

If you hold events on a recurring schedule, such as First Monday or Every Friday, you can define a template with the boilerplate details and quickly generate multiple entries that follow that schedule. Individual event posts can still be customized. For example, you might book a series of monthly events for the year and add the names of speakers or agenda details as you go along.

The RSVP Mailer tool allows you to use the familiar WordPress editor to format email newsletters and promotional messages, which can include embedded events and other dynamic content from your website. You use the same tools to format transactional messages such as confirmation and reminder messages.

### Hosting and Support

RSVPMaker is a free plugin that doesn’t hold much back in terms of “premium” features.

The plugin author is available to consult on customizations, but most generally useful enhancements are folded back into the core plugin code. RSVPMaker also aims to be developer-friendly, allowing you to build event-centric applications on top of it.

Hosting and support of pre-configured websites is available through [RSVPMaker.com](https://rsvpmaker.com/). RSVPMaker.com uses Siteground hosting behind the scenes and Postmark for reliable delivery of email newsletters and transactional messages.

Contact the plugin author for details about additional customizations for reselling Postmark services across WordPress multisite networks.

## Installation

1. Upload the entire `rsvpmaker` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Visit the RSVPMaker options page to configure default values for RSVP email notifications, etc.
4. Check that you have set the timezone for your site on the Settings -> General WordPress admin screen
5. Create and customize your events listing page. Embed the RSVPMaker Upcoming block or the RSVPMaker Query Loop block (a variation on WordPress’s standard Query Loop). The RSVPMaker Calendar block displays a calendar grid. These blocks can also be used to customize the standard archive page displayed at /rsvpmaker/ on your site.
6. OPTIONAL: Depending on your theme, you may want to create a single-rsvpmaker template to prevent confusion between the the event date and the post publication date (move the post publication date to the bottom or just remove it).
7. OPTIONAL: To enable online payments for events, obtain the necessary credentials from PayPal or Stripe to enter into RSVPMaker settings.

I’ve been using this plugin for a couple of months now. It has worked well for me. I have had a couple of issues but David is always quick to address them. If you are looking to do RSVP Forms, give this a try.

I was successful in installing the plugin, but when I activated it, I got this error “The plugin does not have a valid header”. I wonder what causes the issue here?

We only needed some VERY basic functionality which is oddly hard to find in the other RSVP plugins I tried. Most of the other had hard coded requirements that I couldn’t find a way around.
RSVPMaker’s form builder was exactly what we needed.
It take s a little bit to navigate because of all of the features and options, but it can do a lot.

I tried several premium and free plugins but this seems to be doing the job very nicely.
However, the admin flow and design has to be changed a bit.
I can help with the design part of admin section.
