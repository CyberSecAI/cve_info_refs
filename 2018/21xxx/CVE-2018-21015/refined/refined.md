Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21015:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `AVC_DuplicateConfig` function within `isomedia/avc_ext.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the `cfg` parameter passed to the `AVC_DuplicateConfig` function is NULL. The code attempts to access members of this NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) due to a NULL pointer dereference and application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted file. The `MP4Box` tool in GPAC is used to process such crafted files which then triggers the vulnerability when parsing the AVC configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file to the vulnerable application (GPAC). This can occur in scenarios where users process arbitrary media files from untrusted sources.

**Additional details:**
- The provided github issue #1179 shows the crash details including the backtrace and the program state during the crash.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 2072-1) explicitly mentions CVE-2018-21015 and confirms that `AVC_DuplicateConfig()` at `isomedia/avc_ext.c` allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service through a crafted file leading to a null pointer dereference and application crash.
