The provided content is related to CVE-2018-21127.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system without needing prior authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for complete compromise of the affected devices, meaning attackers can gain full control over the device. This includes confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through network communication, likely through HTTP requests, before any authentication is performed.
- The attack vector is "Adjacent", meaning the attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required for exploitation, meaning the vulnerability can be triggered before the user logs in.

**Affected Devices:**
- WAC505, running firmware versions prior to 5.0.0.17
- WAC510, running firmware versions prior to 5.0.0.17
