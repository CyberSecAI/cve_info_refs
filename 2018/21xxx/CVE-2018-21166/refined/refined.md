The provided content is related to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models. However, the advisory is associated with PSV-2017-3167, not CVE-2018-21166. Thus, while the content discusses a vulnerability, it does not match the specified CVE.

The following information is extracted from the advisory, even though it pertains to a different vulnerability than specified:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory does not detail the specific root cause, but it is identified as a denial-of-service vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A denial of service vulnerability exists in the affected NETGEAR router models.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The advisory does not specify the attack vector, only that an adjacent attacker is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The advisory states that the attack vector requires an adjacent attacker. It also suggests that a high privilege is required to trigger this DoS.

**Affected Products:**

*   R6100 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.22)
*   R7500 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.122)
*   R7800 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.42)
*   R8900 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.10)
*   R9000 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.10)
*   WNDR3700v4 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.96)
*   WNDR4300 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.98)
*   WNDR4300v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54)
*   WNDR4500v3 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54)
*   WNR2000v5 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.64)

The advisory also includes a CVSS v3 score of 4.5 with the vector string "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H". This indicates an adjacent attack vector, low attack complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, and a high impact on availability.

This information is associated with PSV-2017-3167 and not CVE-2018-21166.
