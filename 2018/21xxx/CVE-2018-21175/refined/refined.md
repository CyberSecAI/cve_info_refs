The provided content is related to a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router and gateway models. This vulnerability is tracked under the advisory PSV-2017-2624, but does not have a CVE ID associated with it.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication stack overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow vulnerability that can be triggered after successful authentication to the device.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The stack overflow could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device, leading to full control over the router, which includes unauthorized access to network resources, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service. The CVSS v3 rating is Medium with High impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
*  **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the router.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a valid administrative user account and needs to be on the local network of the vulnerable device. This is indicated by the privileges required (PR:H) and attack vector (AV:A) scores. The attack does not require user interaction.

**Affected Devices:**

The advisory lists the following Netgear product models as affected, along with the vulnerable firmware versions:

*   D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
