{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on firmware downgrade process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated firmware downgrade.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can downgrade the firmware to a vulnerable version, potentially exploiting other known vulnerabilities present in the older firmware, or maintain persistent access by downgrading to compromised firmware.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is adjacent network. It means attacker need to be on the same network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the adjacent network to be able to send unauthenticated downgrade request."
