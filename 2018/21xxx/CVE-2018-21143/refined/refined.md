The provided document describes a security advisory for a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in NETGEAR's GS810EMX product, identified as PSV-2018-0220. Although it doesn't mention a CVE ID, it provides details that strongly suggest it corresponds to CVE-2018-21143.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The advisory states that there is a "sensitive information disclosure security vulnerability" in the GS810EMX product.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The specific weakness is sensitive information disclosure. The document does not disclose the exact type of information leaked or the underlying vulnerability that leads to it.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation would lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The document does not specify the exact nature of this information but its disclosure could compromise the confidentiality of the system or connected network.
*   **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector provided (AV:A) indicates that the attack vector is adjacent network.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the device to exploit this vulnerability (Adjacent network). No specific user interaction is required, and the attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N, UI:N).

**Additional notes**

*   The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability affects GS810EMX devices running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.5.
*   NETGEAR recommends updating to the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 6.5 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating that while the attack requires local network access, it is relatively easy to perform and can have a high impact on confidentiality.
*   The advisory acknowledges SÃ©bastien Dusuel for reporting the vulnerability.
