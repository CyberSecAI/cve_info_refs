The provided document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and modem router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document indicates a "post-authentication stack overflow" exists, meaning after a user successfully authenticates with the device, a vulnerability can be triggered in a stack-based buffer. This overflow could be caused by improper handling of data after authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability involves a stack buffer overflow, meaning that a buffer located on the stack is written to beyond its allocated memory space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The CVSS score of 6.8 (Medium) and vector string CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H indicates that a successful exploit could lead to:
    -  **High Confidentiality Impact**: An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the device.
    -  **High Integrity Impact**: The attacker might be able to alter system configuration or files.
    -  **High Availability Impact**: The device could crash or become unresponsive.
- The document states: "The post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps."

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment or have direct access to the deviceâ€™s LAN.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H), suggesting that they need to be a valid user with administrative rights on the device. The user interaction (UI) is none meaning no action is needed by the user, only the attacker needs to send the exploit request.
- The attacker must first authenticate to the affected device before triggering the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- D3600
- D6000
- D6100
- R7800
- R8900
- R9000
- WNDR3700v4
- WNDR4300
- WNDR4300v2
- WNDR4500v3
- WNR2000v5

**Mitigation:**
- The document strongly recommends users download and install the latest firmware for their respective devices to patch the vulnerability.
