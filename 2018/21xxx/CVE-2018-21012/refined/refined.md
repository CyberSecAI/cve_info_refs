Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- It arises from the lack of sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in the `tab` parameter of the GET request when displaying the plugin's admin page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The plugin takes the value of the `tab` parameter from the URL and outputs it directly into the HTML without proper sanitization or encoding. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `tab` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking this malicious link. This is typically done via social engineering, phishing, or by embedding the link on a compromised page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
- They need the ability to generate and distribute a malicious link that contains a crafted `tab` parameter.
- The user targeted must be logged in to the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.3.1 of the "CF7 Invisible reCAPTCHA" plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.2 by sanitizing and escaping the input.
- The proof of concept provided shows that when a logged in administrator visits a specially crafted URL, any available cookies will be shown in an alert box.
- Major web browsers other than Firefox have XSS filtering capabilities which mitigate the impact of this particular exploit.
