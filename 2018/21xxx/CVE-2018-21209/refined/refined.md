The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2017-2514, which affects multiple router and extender models. While the advisory does not mention CVE-2018-21209, it does provide information on a related vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. This means that the vulnerability lies in how the affected devices handle user-supplied input. Specifically, the devices improperly sanitize user input before reflecting it back in the output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable web page. This could potentially lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Credential theft
*   Malware injection
*   Defacement of the web interface

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is reflected in the output without proper sanitization. This would likely involve tricking a user into clicking on a specially crafted URL or visiting a malicious website that redirects to the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload. They also need to trick a user of the vulnerable device to click on the malicious link or visit a malicious webpage which will send the malicious payload to the device.

The advisory provides a list of affected models and firmware versions. It also includes a CVSS v3 rating, scoring, and vector for the vulnerability.
