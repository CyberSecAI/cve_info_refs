The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, which is not associated with CVE-2018-21093.

The advisory is for the vulnerability identified as **PSV-2017-2011**.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the document:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Pre-authentication stack overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Stack overflow vulnerability that can be exploited before authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The CVSS vector indicates the attack vector is adjacent (`AV:A`), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
*   No user interaction (`UI:N`) or special privileges are needed (`PR:H` - this is a mistake and likely should have been `PR:N` or `PR:L` since it is a pre-authentication issue).
