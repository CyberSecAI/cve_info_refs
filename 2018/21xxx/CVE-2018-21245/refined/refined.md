Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21245:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a potential HTTP request smuggling issue due to "fudged headers". This indicates that the `pound` web server was not correctly handling malformed or crafted HTTP headers, leading to request smuggling.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:**  The core weakness is that the server can be tricked into interpreting multiple requests as a single one, or vice-versa, by manipulating HTTP headers. This can lead to requests being routed to the wrong backend server or being processed with unintended parameters, bypassing security controls, and potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The bug description mentions potential request smuggling. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass security controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of data, or even taking control of backend systems in certain scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests with fudged headers. An attacker would send specially crafted HTTP headers that are ambiguous or interpreted differently by the `pound` server and the backend systems.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable `pound` instance. They don't need direct access to the server's filesystem. They can be in a position to send HTTP requests, such as an external network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in `pound` version 2.8. However, due to a build error, upgrading to 2.8 was initially blocked, and instead, the Gentoo package was bumped to 3.0 which included the fix.
*   The dependency `dev-libs/nanomsg` caused some complications as it was not supported on all architectures, which initially prevented a straight upgrade.
*   The bug was resolved by bumping the `www-servers/pound` package to version 3.0 and dropping the old version 2.7f-r1, which had the vulnerability.
*   The impact of this vulnerability was considered low with no reverse dependencies, leading to the decision that a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) was not necessary.

This bug report provides more context than the basic CVE description, by specifying the vulnerable software (`pound`) and giving an idea of how the issue was resolved in the Gentoo ecosystem.
