The provided document discusses a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and gateway models. It is identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2017-2607, but does not have a CVE ID assigned.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication stack overflow.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow vulnerability
**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability as indicated by the CVSS score. The specific nature of what an attacker can do with a successful stack overflow is not disclosed.
**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). This typically means that an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the target device.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the administrative interface. This requires high privileges (PR:H) and the attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
