The provided content is related to a security advisory, **PSV-2017-2631**, concerning a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability in several NETGEAR router models. Although the advisory does not directly reference CVE-2018-21172, it describes a vulnerability that could be related to it. 

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a post-authentication stack overflow. This means that after a user has successfully authenticated, a specially crafted request can cause a buffer overflow in the stack memory of the affected device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer space on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states the CVSS v3 impact as: Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High, Availability: High. Exploitation could potentially lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to take full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is launched over the network. The CVSS vector string indicates the attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A).
- Exploitation requires the attacker to be on the same network segment or physically adjacent to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the device before triggering the vulnerability (PR:H - High privileges).

**Affected Devices (and vulnerable firmware versions):**
- R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.40
- R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52
- WNDR3700v4, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.92
- WNDR4300, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.94
- WNDR4300v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
- WNDR4500v3, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
- WNR2000v5, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.62

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory was published on 2018-03-01.
- The advisory explicitly states that "Associated CVE IDs: None"

**Note:** The provided content does not mention CVE-2018-21172 directly. It references **PSV-2017-2631** for the disclosed vulnerability.

Based on the information, this is a post-authentication vulnerability with significant impact. If CVE-2018-21172 is related to this advisory, it would be a critical vulnerability to address.
