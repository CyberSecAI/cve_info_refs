This document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, identified as PSV-2017-2619, affecting several NETGEAR router and gateway models. However, it does not mention the specific CVE-2018-21180.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Post-authentication stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states that the vulnerability is rated as medium severity. 
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which translates to:
  - Attack Vector: Adjacent (A) - The attack can occur from a network that is logically adjacent to the target.
  - Attack Complexity: Low (L) - Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist.
  - Privileges Required: High (H) - The attacker must have administrative level privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
  - User Interaction: None (N) - No human user needs to perform an action for the exploit.
  - Scope: Unchanged (U) - An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority.
  - Confidentiality Impact: High (H) - There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.
  - Integrity Impact: High (H) - There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection, resulting in the attacker gaining full control over the impacted component.
  - Availability Impact: High (H) - There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully stop the device from functioning, or making resources completely inaccessible.
-  Successful exploitation can lead to the attacker gaining full control over the impacted device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is adjacent, meaning it needs to come from a local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to access the affected device.
