Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a TLS client authentication bypass. The specific flaw lies in how Caddy handled TLS client authentication, allowing a bypass under certain circumstances, which are not specified in detail in this provided information. The fix implemented included a "StrictHostMatching mode" to prevent this bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **TLS client auth bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass client authentication in a TLS connection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass client authentication, gaining unauthorized access to resources or services that require client certificate authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a TLS connection where client authentication is expected.
- Details of the specific scenario needed to trigger the bypass are not available in the provided text.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to initiate a TLS connection to a Caddy server that is configured to require client authentication.
- The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerability present in older versions of Caddy.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bug report indicates that the issue was resolved in Caddy version 0.10.13 and the Gentoo package has been updated, resolving this CVE.
- The fix involved the introduction of "StrictHostMatching" in the TLS configuration.
- It's also noted that version 0.10.13 has another bug that prevents certificate obtainment, so version 0.10.14 was the correct update to make.
