The provided content is related to CVE-2018-21037.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Subrion CMS application is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack due to the lack of CSRF token implementation and source origin validation for password change requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Absence of CSRF protection mechanisms (CSRF token).
- Lack of source origin validation for requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can change an administrator's password by crafting a malicious request and tricking the administrator into executing it, potentially leading to complete control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts an HTTP request to change a userâ€™s password and tricks a legitimate user to execute the crafted request through various means such as email links or malicious websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to trick a user into executing a crafted request, but does not need to have authenticated access to the application.
