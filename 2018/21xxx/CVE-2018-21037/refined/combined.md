## Description

[![@TusharKdm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36395331?v=4&size=48)](/TusharKdm)[TusharKdm](https://github.com/TusharKdm)opened [on Feb 13, 2018](https://github.com/intelliants/subrion/issues/638#issue-296637859)

Hi Team,

The application is vulnerable to CSRF attack.

Affected Application Version: Subrion CMS 4.1.5

The attacker can change the administrator password by sending a crafted request to the application on change password field.

The application is not validating the source origin of the request is coming from also CSRF token is not implemented.

**Proof of concept as given below**

1. Crafted Code of Change Password of Administrator User.

[![csrf attacke code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137449-4ad05bc4-10bb-11e8-8618-f3530ac7901e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137449-4ad05bc4-10bb-11e8-8618-f3530ac7901e.png)

2. Crafted Request to Change the Password of Administrator.

[![csrf crafted request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137562-d87d58be-10bb-11e8-8487-a437b069cb0c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137562-d87d58be-10bb-11e8-8487-a437b069cb0c.png)

3. The Password is Changed Successfully.

[![password changed successfully](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137619-14e3da9e-10bc-11e8-8fce-ead0a1cc9a26.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36395331/36137619-14e3da9e-10bc-11e8-8fce-ead0a1cc9a26.png)

Recommendation:

1. Implement CSRF Token.
2. Validate the Source Origin

When you fix the bug, please, can you include my name in the release notes when the bug will be corrected?
