it shows an error when other user roles like editor, author , subscriber or any other roles except administrator tries to upload the media or attch file to it. But for admin roles its a perfect to upload any post from frontend but whats the use of plugin if it works only for admin role.

There are very few plugins that can do what this does, let users submit information for the front end but also can keep it private. Very easy to use! I found some limitations but notified support who quickly fixed them. My only constructive feedback is for support to respond more quickly, that’s what will turn a free user into a paid one (in my case eventually I was able to communicate more directly with support through slack and believe they will be more responsive for others)
