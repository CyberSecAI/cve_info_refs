- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could potentially lead to complete compromise of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered post-authentication, meaning an attacker needs valid credentials to exploit it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the device's administrative interface. The attack would likely be executed remotely over the network if remote management is enabled, or locally if the attacker is on the local network.
