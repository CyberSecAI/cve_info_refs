The provided content is related to a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as indicated by the CVSS vector (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- Specifically, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to full control.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is reachable via network, requiring an adjacent network position. (AV:A)
- The vulnerability requires a high-privileged attacker to be authenticated to the device. (PR:H)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on an adjacent network to the target device.
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the device.

**Affected Products:**
The following Netgear product models are vulnerable with firmware versions prior to the ones listed:
- D7800, prior to 1.0.1.34
- R6100, prior to 1.0.1.22
- R7500, prior to 1.0.0.122
- R7500v2, prior to 1.0.3.26
- R7800, prior to 1.0.2.40
- R9000, prior to 1.0.2.52
- WNDR3700v4, prior to 1.0.2.92
- WNDR4300, prior to 1.0.2.94
- WNDR4300v2, prior to 1.0.0.50
- WNDR4500v3, prior to 1.0.0.50
- WNR2000v5, prior to 1.0.0.62

The advisory also includes a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 and a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
