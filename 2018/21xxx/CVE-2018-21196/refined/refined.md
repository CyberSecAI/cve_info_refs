The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of several NETGEAR routers and gateways.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Post-authentication stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete control of the affected device. This is indicated by the CVSS v3 score showing high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device (e.g. connected to the same wireless network, or LAN).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:H), implying they would need to have valid administrative credentials to access the affected device's management interface.
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).
*   The scope is unchanged (S:U) meaning the attack is limited to the affected device.

**Affected Products:**
*   D6100, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
*   R6100, firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.20
*   R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.40
*   R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52
*   WNDR3700v4, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.92
*   WNDR4300, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.94
*   WNR2000v5, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.62

The advisory recommends updating to the latest firmware versions to mitigate the vulnerability.
