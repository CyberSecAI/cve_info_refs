Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Jupyter Notebook server was not using a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to isolate served files, specifically HTML and SVG files. This meant that these files were treated as being from the same origin as the notebook server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing CSP Header:** The primary weakness was the lack of a CSP header that would sandbox served files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The absence of proper origin separation allowed for XSS attacks.  An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript within an untrusted HTML or SVG file.
*   **Same-Origin Issue**:  Because the browser treated these files as having the same origin as the notebook server, the malicious JavaScript code could interact with the notebook server's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's notebook session by injecting it into served HTML or SVG files.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  The malicious JavaScript could potentially access sensitive data within the notebook session, modify the notebook, or perform other actions with the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Files:** The primary attack vector involves uploading or serving maliciously crafted HTML or SVG files containing JavaScript code.
*   **File Access via `/files/` URL:**  The vulnerability specifically applies when users access HTML/SVG files via `/files/` URLs, which, without the CSP, would not sandbox the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve or Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to either serve the malicious file from a location that a user can access through the `/files/` endpoint, or upload the file to a location where it will be served by the server.
*   **Knowledge of Jupyter Notebook Behavior**:  An understanding of how Jupyter Notebook handles file serving and how to craft effective XSS payloads within HTML/SVG is necessary.

**Mitigation:**

The identified fix is the implementation of a `Content-Security-Policy` header with `sandbox allow-scripts` to treat served files as belonging to a separate origin. This prevents Javascript code within the served file from interacting with the notebook server. The fix was implemented by overriding the `content_security_policy` property in the `notebook/base/handlers.py` file.
