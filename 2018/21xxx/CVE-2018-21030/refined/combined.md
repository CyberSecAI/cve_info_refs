### @takluyver **[takluyver](/takluyver)** commented [Feb 15, 2018](#issue-297458095)

We already contain these files using the `/view/` handler, which displays them inside an iframe with the same sandboxing. This PR ensures that if a user ends up viewing an untrusted HTML/SVG file at a `/files/` URL (instead of `/view/`), it will still be sandboxed, using the [Content-Security Policy: sandbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/sandbox) header.

The browser then treats the page as having a unique origin, so cross-origin protection prevents any Javascript from communicating with the notebook server.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This also overrides any currently set `Content-Security-Policy` -- should we merge with the operator's settings?

Note: I refer to operator to mean whoever administers this deployment, whether a local server user or a jupyterhub administrator.

Yes, good point. Do you think it's sufficient to use `add_header()` to do this, or should we get into checking any existing `Content-Security-Policy` headers?

Can multiple CSP headers be set and do what we want? If not, we might want to override the inherited [content\_security\_policy property](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/base/handlers.py#L66) instead.

[From MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy):

> You can use the Content-Security-Policy header more than once... Adding additional policies can only further restrict the capabilities of the protected resource

I think that means this should work, but maybe the c\_s\_p property is a neater way to achieve the same thing?

Interesting, I didn't realize we could add multiple headers with the same key. How does `set_header` work when there are multiple headers with the same key from `add_header`?

I think `set_header` blows away anything that was set before.

My question comes down to "what's the set of headers after running the following"

```
self.add_header("X", "y")
self.add_header("X", "z")
self.set_header("X", "x")
```

I'm thinking using only one header is good. For now I think the value you've set here is a very sane default and further enhancements on merging content security policies can be separate work.

Package        : jupyter-notebook
Version        : 4.2.3-4+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-8768 CVE-2018-19351 CVE-2018-21030
Debian Bug     : 893436 917409

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in jupyter-notebook.

CVE-2018-8768

    A maliciously forged notebook file can bypass sanitization to execute
    Javascript in the notebook context. Specifically, invalid HTML is
    'fixed' by jQuery after sanitization, making it dangerous.

CVE-2018-19351

    allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because nbconvert responses are
    considered to have the same origin as the notebook server.

CVE-2018-21030

    jupyter-notebook does not use a CSP header to treat served files as
    belonging to a separate origin. Thus, for example, an XSS payload can
    be placed in an SVG document.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.2.3-4+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jupyter-notebook packages.

For the detailed security status of jupyter-notebook please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jupyter-notebook>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
