This document describes a security advisory, PSV-2017-2198, for a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, extender, and cradle models. However, it **does not mention CVE-2018-21139**.

The document provides the following information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive information disclosure. The document doesn't give specifics on how the information is disclosed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The document states that this is a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability, which implies an attacker could gain access to confidential data. The CVSS v3 score indicates that the impact to confidentiality is high, the impact to integrity is low, and the impact to availability is none.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N` suggests the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A).
- Adjacent means the attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target device.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).

The advisory lists numerous affected NETGEAR product models and their vulnerable firmware versions, and it strongly recommends updating to the latest firmware to remediate the issue.

**Note:** Although the document does not explicitly mention CVE-2018-21139, it is still a relevant security advisory from Netgear. Because the CVE is a placeholder, this content may be related.
