The provided content relates to CVE-2018-21020.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Type juggling on authentication in `centreonAuth.class.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to type juggling during the authentication process. This means that the application may be comparing values of different data types (e.g., string and integer) using loose comparison operators, which can lead to unexpected behavior and allow bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication. The severity of impact is described as low.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in `centreonAuth.class.php`. An attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the authentication endpoint to exploit the type juggling flaw.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Centreon web interface and be able to send requests to the login page.
