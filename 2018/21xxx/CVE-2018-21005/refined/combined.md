This was a terrific plugin ‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt. Comments no longer are automatically added to the BBpress Forum and you can‚Äôt selectively shut down the comments to compel readers to go to the Forum if they want to take part. I note it hasn‚Äôt been updated for two years. Could that be the problem?

Hello, first of all my congratulations to the developer of excellent plugin, it works correctly, highly recommended to move debates to the correct site since bbpress does not have this serial utility. Thank you very much for this excellent plugin !!!

I‚Äôve added this plugin to my official recommended bbPress plugins.
It is seamless, does exactly what is needed to control visitors who highjack topics. Don‚Äôt know how one could run a forum without this plugin.

All three of this author‚Äôs bbPress plugins including this one are amazingly well designed and laid out‚Ä¶ Their user interfaces seem to have had a lot of attention to detail‚Ä¶ And best of all, all three are very helpful, give me some possibilities I‚Äôve been seeking for a while, and I‚Äôve yet to experience any glitches with them‚Ä¶
To be as new as they are and still be able to say this about them seems to suggest the possibility of some good support and additional features in the future‚Ä¶
