Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21009:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a potential integer overflow in the `Parser::makeStream` function within the Poppler library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow, which occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type being used. In this case it happens during the size calculation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. An integer overflow during stream creation can lead to unpredictable behavior in the Poppler library. The overflow may result in allocation of an incorrect amount of memory.
*   **Unspecified Impact**: The initial report mentions "possibly other unspecified impact when processing maliciously crafted documents", so there may be other effects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted PDF Documents:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted PDF documents. The attacker would need to create a PDF file with specific parameters that, when parsed by Poppler, cause an integer overflow in `Parser::makeStream`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable software (Poppler library) with a specially crafted PDF document. This could involve:
    *   Sending the malicious PDF to a system using a service that uses the poppler library
    *   Having the target user open the crafted PDF in a PDF reader that uses the poppler library
    *   Placing a PDF in a location that is processed by a backend system using the Poppler library.

**Technical Details from Commit:**

*   The commit message "Parser::makeStream: Fix potential integer overflow" clearly indicates the location and nature of the vulnerability.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is an integer overflow within the Poppler PDF rendering library. By crafting a malicious PDF document, an attacker can trigger this overflow in the `Parser::makeStream` function, leading to a denial of service and possibly other unspecified impacts.
