Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a post-authentication stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow: A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs on the stack. This means that an attacker can overwrite data on the stack, including return addresses, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected device. This could lead to data breaches, malware infection, or the device being used as part of a botnet. The CVSS score suggests high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered after successful authentication. The specific attack vector is not detailed in the advisory, but it involves sending a malicious request that causes a stack buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, meaning they must have valid credentials for the router's web interface or other authentication mechanism. This indicates the attacker would need to be on the network (or have remote access through other vulnerabilities) and have valid admin credentials.
-The advisory indicates the vulnerability is exploitable by an adjacent attacker.

**Affected Products:**
- D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
- D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.28
- R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.24
- R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.40
- R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.6

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSS v3 Rating: Medium
- CVSS v3 Score: 6.8
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This advisory provides more detail than a typical CVE entry as it contains information about affected products, firmware versions, and mitigation measures (firmware update), as well as acknowledgements and contact information.
