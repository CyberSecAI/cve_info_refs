This document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed NETGEAR devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stack overflow:**  A buffer overflow on the stack can be triggered after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Complete compromise:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the affected devices, leading to a full compromise of the device (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is likely launched over the network.
*   **Authentication required:** The attacker needs to successfully authenticate to the device before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the device's management interface.
*   **Network access:**  The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the targeted device.

**Affected devices (and vulnerable firmware versions):**
*   D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
*   D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.34
*   R6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.20
*   R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.24
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.40
*   R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.6
*   WNDR3700v4, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.92
*   WNDR4300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.94
*   WNDR4300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
*   WNDR4500v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
*   WNR2000v5, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.62

**CVSS v3 Score:** 6.8 (Medium)
**CVSS v3 Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
(Attack Vector: Adjacent, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: High, User Interaction: None, Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality: High, Integrity: High, Availability: High)

**Mitigation:** NETGEAR advises users to update to the latest firmware.
