The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear addressing a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, identified as PSV-2017-0645, affecting several of their router, modem router, and wireless extender models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection. This indicates that after a user successfully authenticates to the device, they can inject malicious commands into the system through a vulnerable interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is the presence of a command injection flaw in the web interface, that allows the injection of system commands after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   **C:H (High Confidentiality impact):** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the device.
*   **I:H (High Integrity impact):** Ability to modify device settings, firmware, or other data.
*   **A:H (High Availability impact):** Potential to disrupt device operation, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a network adjacent attacker (AV:A), which implies the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or be able to route to it (ie local network).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device (PR:H - High Privileges).
*   The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
*   The attack is on a device that does not require a separate security scope (S:U - Unchanged).
*   The attack has low complexity (AC:L).

**Affected Models and Firmware:**
The advisory lists the affected models and the specific firmware versions that are vulnerable. Models include:

*   D7800 (prior to 1.0.1.44)
*   EX6150v2 (prior to 1.0.1.70)
*   EX6100v2 (prior to 1.0.1.70)
*   EX6200v2 (prior to 1.0.1.64)
*   EX7300 (prior to 1.0.2.136)
*   EX6400 (prior to 1.0.2.136)
*   R6100 (prior to 1.0.1.16)
*   R7500 (prior to 1.0.0.110)
*   R7800 (prior to 1.0.2.32)
*   R9000 (prior to 1.0.4.12)
*   WN3000RPv2 (prior to 1.0.0.56)
*   WN3000RPv3 (prior to 1.0.2.52)
*   WNDR4300v2 (prior to 1.0.0.50)
*   WNDR4500v3 (prior to 1.0.0.50)

**Mitigation:**
The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the firmware of the affected devices to the versions mentioned in the advisory or later.
The document provides instructions on how to find and download the firmware.

**CVSS v3 Score:**
CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Score: 7.5 (Medium severity).
