    {
      "root_cause": "The application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",

        "Untrusted URL Invocation"

    {
     "root_cause": "The application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents.",

        "Incorrect Signature Verification"
      ],
      "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents.",

      "root_cause": "The application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users.",

        "Information Disclosure"
