Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21036:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly addresses CVE-2018-21036. The email on openwall.com and the commit messages on github.com confirm that this CVE is related to a denial-of-service vulnerability in Sails.js due to a lack of error handling for empty pathnames in WebSocket requests.

**2. Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `sails-hook-sockets` not handling an empty pathname when parsing the URL of incoming WebSocket requests. Specifically, when the URL parsing logic encounters an empty pathname, it could lead to an error because it attempts to call `.match()` on a null value, resulting in a crash.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Validation/Error Handling**: The code does not anticipate or handle malformed URLs where the pathname component is missing or empty.
- **Uncaught Exception**: The lack of error handling during URL parsing leads to an unhandled exception.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker can cause the Sails.js application to crash with a single malicious request by sending a WebSocket request to the server with a malformed URL containing no path, leading to unavailability of the application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed WebSocket Request**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a WebSocket request with a URL that has an empty pathname.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send a WebSocket request to the server hosting the Sails.js application.
- **Basic Knowledge**: The attacker does not require advanced skills. A simple malformed request is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code resides within the `sails-hook-sockets` module.
*   The specific commits fixing this issue are:
    *   [https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets/commit/ff02114eaec090ee51db48435cc32d451662606e](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets/commit/ff02114eaec090ee51db48435cc32d451662606e) - Introduced `req.path` for socket requests, but did not account for missing paths
    *   [https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets/commit/0533a4864b1920fd8fbb5287bc0889193c5faf44](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets/commit/0533a4864b1920fd8fbb5287bc0889193c5faf44) - Ensures `req.path` is a string using a default value of `/` when the parsed path is null.
*   The fix involves adding a default value ("/") when the URL parsing results in a null pathname to prevent the `.match()` call on a null value.
*   The affected versions are Sails.js before v1.0.0-46 and sails-hook-sockets before 1.5.5.
