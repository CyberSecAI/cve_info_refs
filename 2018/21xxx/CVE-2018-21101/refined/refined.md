- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for command injection after successful authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device. The CVSS v3 rating is 8.8, indicating high impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have already authenticated to the device (PR:L, low privileges) and does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
