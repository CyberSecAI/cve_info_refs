Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21025:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a cron job (`centreon_autodisco`) that is executed as root, but the script itself is owned by the `apache` user and is writable by this user.
- This allows an attacker with control over the apache user to modify the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The core vulnerability is that a process owned by a lower-privileged user (`apache`) is being executed by a higher-privileged user (`root`) via a cron job.
- **Insecure File Permissions:**  The script executed by the cron job has insecure file permissions, allowing modification by a low privileged user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user with access to the `apache` account can modify the `centreon_autodisco` script. Because the script is executed as `root` by the cron job, a malicious user can achieve arbitrary code execution as root. This allows complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves compromising the `apache` user on the Centreon-VM server. Once achieved the attacker would overwrite the script `/usr/share/centreon/www/modules/centreon-autodiscovery-server//cron/centreon_autodisco`. Then, the cron job will execute the script with root privileges, giving the attacker the ability to run commands as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the Centreon-VM system as the `apache` user. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in web applications or other means.
