The provided content is related to a security advisory for a pre-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability, but it does not correspond to the CVE ID provided (CVE-2018-21220). This document references NETGEAR's advisory PSV-2017-2481. Therefore, while relevant to security, it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2018-21220.

However, here's the information about the vulnerability described in this document:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A pre-authentication buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of several NETGEAR router and gateway models. This vulnerability is present before authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is not explicitly stated but, a successful exploitation of buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unauthorized access to the device. The CVSS v3 score indicates High impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is Adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network segment (adjacent) as the targeted device. The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) or any user interaction (UI:N). The attack complexity is low (AC:L).

**Affected products (and vulnerable firmware versions):**
