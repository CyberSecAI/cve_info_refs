Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21035:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Qt WebSocket implementation allows a maximum frame size of 2^31 - 2 bytes, which is a very large value. An attacker can exploit this by establishing numerous WebSocket connections and sending partial messages with large frame sizes. This can exhaust the virtual memory of the process running the WebSocket, leading to a crash and a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted maximum frame/message size: The `MAX_FRAME_SIZE_IN_BYTES` and `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE_IN_BYTES` are defined as `INT_MAX - 1`, which is too large.
- Lack of control over data reception: The existing signals in `QWebSocket` only trigger when a full frame or message is received, making it impossible to preemptively discard large frames.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By sending large partial messages across multiple WebSocket connections, an attacker can cause the server or client application to exhaust its memory and crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attacker sends malicious WebSocket messages over the network to the vulnerable server or client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to establish WebSocket connections to a vulnerable server or client.
- They need to be able to craft and send WebSocket messages with large frame sizes.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is easy to exploit.
- The issue affects multiple Qt versions: 5.11.2, 5.12.1, 5.12.4, 5.13.0, 5.14.1, and 5.15.
- The suggested solutions to address this vulnerability are:
    - Allow users to modify the maximum frame/message size through a class parameter.
    - Implement a signal that triggers on every reception of data, allowing to discard large frames/messages early.
- The fix has been implemented in version 5.15.0 Beta3.
