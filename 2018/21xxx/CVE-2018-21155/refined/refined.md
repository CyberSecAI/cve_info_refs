This document details a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document states a "stored cross-site scripting security vulnerability" exists, but does not give the root cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
The advisory does not go into specific detail regarding the impact, but generally, successful XSS attacks can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Phishing attacks
- Defacement of the web interface
- Potential execution of malicious code on the user's browser, possibly leading to further compromise

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that the malicious script is stored on the device and executed when a user interacts with the affected page.
- This usually involves an attacker injecting malicious code into a field or parameter that is not properly sanitized before being displayed to other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to find a way to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable input field or parameter.
- Since it's stored XSS, the attack would then execute when a user views the vulnerable page on the router.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network to inject the script, but the victim user must access the affected page of the router to be impacted.
- The CVSS vector indicates a required user interaction (UI:R) making it likely that the vulnerable input is not accessible to unauthenticated users.
