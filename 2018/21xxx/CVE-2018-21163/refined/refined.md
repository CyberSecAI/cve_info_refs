This document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, gateway, and extender models. Although no CVE ID is listed, this advisory is for PSV-2017-0308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack overflow that occurs after successful authentication to the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed NETGEAR devices. This is likely due to insufficient bounds checking when handling input data.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected devices, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the device. This could lead to data theft, denial of service, or further attacks on the network.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local network access. An attacker must first authenticate to the device's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the local network and have valid credentials to log in to the device's web interface.

The advisory also includes a CVSS v3 rating:
- CVSS v3 Score: 6.8 (Medium)
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
   - AV:A (Adjacent) - Attack vector is adjacent network
   - AC:L (Low) - Attack complexity is low
   - PR:H (High) - Privileges required are high (admin access)
   - UI:N (None) - User interaction is not required
   - S:U (Unchanged) - Scope is unchanged
   - C:H (High) - Confidentiality impact is high
   - I:H (High) - Integrity impact is high
   - A:H (High) - Availability impact is high
