This document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability in NETGEAR R7800 and R9000 routers.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow vulnerability in the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Post-authentication stack overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, denial of service, or other malicious activities. The CVSS v3 score is 6.8, with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the router's web interface (PR:H - High Privileges) and no user interaction is required (UI:N).
