{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect usage of the `Vec::from_raw_parts()` constructor within the `safe-transmute` crate. Specifically, the `length` and `capacity` arguments were swapped.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow or memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "The incorrect parameter order can lead to memory corruption or data leakage. This could result in a heap buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unintended behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "No privileges or user interaction are required to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation can be achieved remotely over a network."
