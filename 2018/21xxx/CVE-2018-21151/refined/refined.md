The provided content is related to a security advisory for a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models. Although the advisory doesn't directly reference CVE-2018-21151, it provides information on a buffer overflow vulnerability, which aligns with the nature of this type of CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed NETGEAR router models. This can occur after the user has successfully authenticated.

**Impact of exploitation:**  The CVSS v3 score of 6.8 and vector string (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) suggests a high impact:
    - Confidentiality: High (C:H)
    - Integrity: High (I:H)
    - Availability: High (A:H)
    An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify system settings, or cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
    - Adjacent Network (AV:A): The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
    - Low Attack Complexity (AC:L)
    - Requires High Privileges (PR:H): The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
    - No User Interaction (UI:N)
    - Unchanged Scope (S:U)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
    - The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the router's management interface.

**Affected Models and Firmware Versions:**
The following models and firmware versions are affected:
*   D7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.34
*   R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.26
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.42
*   R8900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.10
*   R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.10
*  WNDR4300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54
*   WNDR4500v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory states that the vulnerability is a post-authentication issue, which means it can only be exploited after an attacker has gained administrative access to the router.
* NETGEAR recommends that users download and install the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was reported by aircut on Bugcrowd.
