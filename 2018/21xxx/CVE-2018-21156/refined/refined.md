The provided content is related to a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple NETGEAR products. However, the advisory does not list CVE-2018-21156. The vulnerability is tracked under PSV-2017-2460.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of various NETGEAR routers, gateways and extenders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow: A flaw where a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states a CVSS v3 rating of medium with the following vector string "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", which means:
    - **Confidentiality:** High - Sensitive information may be disclosed
    - **Integrity:** High - Data may be modified
    - **Availability:** High - The service might be interrupted or become unavailable
- The potential impact is that attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A)
- This means the attacker needs to be in the same network or within the same broadcast domain to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privilege Required:** High (PR:H) - The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** None (UI:N) - No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability after authentication.

**Affected Products:**
The following product models with firmware versions prior to the ones listed are affected:
* D6220, D6400, D7000v2, D8500, DGN2200v4, DGN2200Bv4, EX3700, EX3800, EX6000, EX6100, EX6120, EX6130, EX6150, EX6200, EX7000, R6250, R6300v2, R6400, R6400v2, R6700, R6900, R6900P, R7000, R7000P, R7300DST, R7900, R7900P, R8000, R8000P, R8300, R8500, WN2500RPv2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2
