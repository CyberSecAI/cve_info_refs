The provided content is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router models, but it is **NOT** related to CVE-2018-21226. 

The advisory, identified as PSV-2017-0748, discusses a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication on specific router models running older firmware versions.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The document mentions an "authentication bypass security vulnerability" without specifying technical details about the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism on the affected routers.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the router's administration interface and potentially its network. The advisory lists the CVSS v3 impact as C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). This suggests that an attacker must be on the same local network segment as the affected router to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable router and does not need any prior authentication (PR:N). User interaction (UI) is not required.

**Affected Devices:** The following models are vulnerable with firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.48:

*   JNR1010v2
*   JWNR2010v5
*   WNR1000v4
*   WNR2020
*   WNR2050

The advisory strongly recommends users update their router's firmware to the latest version.
