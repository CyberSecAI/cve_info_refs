It clarifies that the vulnerability is not in Plex itself but in the misconfiguration of a third party application, Tautulli, and provides technical details of the attack and mitigation. It mentions the use of Shodan to find exposed Tautulli instances and details the process of extracting the Plex token and using it to gain access to the Plex media server. It also gives a detailed explanation of how to prevent the described attack by requiring authentication for Tautulli.  It also clarifies the version of CherryPy used and Tautulli's history as PlexPy.
