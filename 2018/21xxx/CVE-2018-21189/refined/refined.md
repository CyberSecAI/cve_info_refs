The provided content is related to CVE-2018-21189.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of specific NETGEAR router and gateway models. This vulnerability can be triggered after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the affected device, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is indicated by the high scores for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability in the CVSS vector.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network segment or be within range of the device's Wi-Fi network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H), meaning they need valid administrative credentials to authenticate to the device before exploiting the vulnerability, and no user interaction is required(UI:N) for successful exploit.
