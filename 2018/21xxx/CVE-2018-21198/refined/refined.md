This document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the listed Netgear routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device, potentially leading to full control of the device. This could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered after successful authentication to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the router's web interface or other management interfaces before exploiting the vulnerability. They need to be on the same network or have some form of network access to the device.

**Affected Products:**

* D6100 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57)
* R7800 (firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.44)
* R9000 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52)
* WNDR3700v4 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.92)
* WNDR4300 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.94)
* WNDR4300v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54)
* WNDR4500v3 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.54)
* WNR2000v5 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.62)

The document also includes a CVSS v3 vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
This translates to:
* Attack Vector: Adjacent
* Attack Complexity: Low
* Privileges Required: High
* User Interaction: None
* Scope: Unchanged
* Confidentiality: High
* Integrity: High
* Availability: High
