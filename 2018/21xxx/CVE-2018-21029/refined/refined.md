Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21029:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2018-21029. This is evident from the NetApp advisory (NTAP-20191122-0002) which explicitly mentions the CVE ID and states that "Systemd versions 239 through 243 are susceptible to a vulnerability." Additionally, the GitHub content confirms this by discussing a fix for the "incorrect certificate validation with DNS over TLS" in systemd, referencing the specific issue number #9397 which is also mentioned in the NetApp advisory.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of certificate validation in systemd-resolved when using DNS-over-TLS (DoT) with GnuTLS. Specifically, the resolver accepted any certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, failing to validate the certificate against the expected hostname or IP address of the DNS server.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Incorrect Certificate Validation**: The systemd-resolved component, when configured with `DNSOverTLS=yes`, does not properly validate the server's certificate. It accepts any certificate signed by a trusted CA, without verifying if the certificate matches the intended DNS server's hostname or IP address.
    *   **Lack of SNI**:  Server Name Indication (SNI) is not sent in the TLS handshake.
    *  **Vulnerability in Opportunistic Mode**: While the initial implementation of DNS-over-TLS in systemd (versions 239-242) only supported the opportunistic mode, it lacked proper authentication of the server, as documented.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: An attacker positioned on the network path between a client and a DNS server can exploit this flaw to conduct a MitM attack.
    *   **Eavesdropping**: Attackers can intercept and monitor DNS queries and responses.
    *  **Data Modification**: Attackers can modify DNS responses, potentially redirecting victims to malicious sites, or inject false records.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exploitation could also lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if the attacker causes DNS lookups to fail.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The primary attack vector is a MitM attack performed on the network path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the client (systemd-resolved) and the DNS server to intercept and modify DNS traffic.
    *   The attacker needs a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA in order to successfully perform the MitM attack when strict mode is enabled.

**3. Additional Information**

*   **Versions Affected**: The NetApp advisory indicates that systemd versions 239 through 243 are susceptible to this vulnerability. The GitHub issue also confirms that the vulnerability exists in systemd versions 239-242, and that version 243 is the target for the fix.
*   **Fix**: The issue was addressed in systemd version 243 by implementing proper IP address validation in the certificate when GnuTLS is used. A commit on GitHub ([`b7a4129`](/systemd/systemd/commit/b7a4129ca946ed49e161a03283faf5bbab96d110)) indicates the fix.
*   **NetApp Products**: The NetApp advisory states that no NetApp products were found to be affected but includes a long list of "Products Not Affected".
*   **Configuration**: The vulnerability is related to the `DNSOverTLS` option in the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file. When set to `yes` the vulnerability was present. The advisory states that RHEL 8 shipped with versions of `systemd` that only supported `opportunistic` mode and didn't implement strict checking of the certificate. The `opportunistic` mode is inherently vulnerable to MitM attacks due to the lack of authentication, but the `strict` mode in systemd versions 243 and later is vulnerable if an attacker can obtain a valid cert.
*  **GnuTLS vs OpenSSL:** The vulnerability is specific to the GnuTLS backend used for TLS in systemd-resolved, the OpenSSL backend performed the certificate validation correctly from the beginning.
*   **Impact on DNSSEC**: Although the CVE is focused on DNS-over-TLS (DoT), it mentions that DNSSEC validation is impacted by how the data is retrieved, and if servers do not properly support DNSSEC all validations will fail.
* **Downgrade Attacks**: Both the official CVE description, and the information provided in the analyzed text, mention the vulnerabilities present in the "allow-downgrade" mode which makes DNSSEC and DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to downgrade attacks.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2018-21029 is a critical vulnerability in systemd that allows a MitM attacker to intercept and modify DNS traffic due to the lack of proper certificate validation in the DNS-over-TLS implementation. While this vulnerability was fixed in systemd 243, affected NetApp products were not identified.
