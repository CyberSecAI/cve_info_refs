This plugin has been amazing for our ministry website. The support is just as amazing! Just recently we had to update the plugin, but something went awry during the update. I reached out to Support, and David promptly replied and had it resolved in no time. Additionally, I had a few other tweaking questions, and David was prompt and generous with assisting me with that, as well. Highly recommend this plugin and this company!!!

During my 4 years with Charitable, I’ve had nothing but a great experience! The plugin works flawlessly, but what really sets these guys apart is SUPPORT. They respond quickly and are extremely helpful to someone who sometimes struggles with implementation details. During these 4 years they’ve made consistent improvements and have been very willing to assist with adapting to the needs of my individual circumstances. Can’t recommend Charitable highly enough.

Everything you need to know about Charitable and our team.

[![](https://www.wpcharitable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/charitable-1-5-14.jpg "charitable-1-5-14 | Charitable")](https://www.wpcharitable.com/release-notes-security-release-1-5-14/)
# Release Notes: Security Release 1.5.14

Last updated on

August 26, 2024

* By

Eric Daams

**tldr;** If you haven’t already, upgrade to Charitable 1.5.14. It resolves a security bug affecting some sites using Charitable.

Earlier this week we released Charitable 1.5.14, which fixes an security issue. We recommend all Charitable users upgrade to version 1.5.14 to fix a bug that can in certain scenarios allow unauthorized users to access the user and donation details of previous donations. Payment details such as credit card details were **not** exposed.

You can download this update via the plugin updater in WordPress, or from [WordPress.org](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/charitable.latest-stable.zip).

The issue was discovered internally late on Tuesday and we were able to get an update out by Wednesday evening local time. While we are not aware of any active attempts to exploit this bug, we have decided to be transparent in disclosing the issue to encourage all of our users to upgrade as soon as possible.

To all Charitable users: We are genuinely sorry for this security issue. We are disappointed to have let this one through, and we are committed to continuously improving Charitable in every respect.

We take all security issues very seriously at Charitable. If you believe you have found a security issue with Charitable, we ask that you contact our team directly at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#98ebfdfbedeaf1ece1d8efe8fbf0f9eaf1ecf9faf4fdb6fbf7f5).
