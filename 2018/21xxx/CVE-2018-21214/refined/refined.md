This document describes a pre-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router, gateway, and extender models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow that occurs before authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Pre-authentication buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the affected device. The CVSS score indicates a high impact with full compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be within the same network segment (adjacent network) as the targeted device. No user interaction (UI:N) or privileges (PR:N) are required. The attack is of low complexity (AC:L).

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
- D3600, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.67
- D6000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.67
- EX2700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.28
- R6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.20
- R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.24
