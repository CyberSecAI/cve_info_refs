The provided content is a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in Netgear R7800 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection. An attacker can inject malicious commands to be executed by the router.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the affected device, potentially allowing the attacker to control the router, steal data, or perform other malicious activities. The advisory states the impact as Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability being High.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the local network, requiring access to the router's administrative interface, which makes it an adjacent network attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have valid credentials for the router's administrative interface. This means the attacker must have already gained some level of access or be an authorized user before exploiting the command injection vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The advisory assigns a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 and vector CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* The affected product is the R7800 router with firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.60
* The vulnerability was reported by aircut.
* NETGEAR advises users to update to the latest firmware version as soon as possible to mitigate the risk.
