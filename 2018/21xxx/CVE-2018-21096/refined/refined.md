The provided content is related to CVE-2018-21096.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the web interface of several NETGEAR wireless access points.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions on the vulnerable device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful attack could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the device by a user, such as a configuration change.
- The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability, suggesting the attack could potentially disrupt the normal functioning of the access point.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be within the same network segment or be able to access the network the device is on.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning a victim needs to visit a malicious site or open a malicious email with a crafted request.
- The attack requires low privileges (PR:L), so an attacker does not need to be an admin user on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the same network or have access to the same network as the vulnerable access point.
- The attacker needs to trick a user who has access to the device's web interface into performing a crafted request (e.g., by visiting a malicious site or opening a malicious link).
- The attacker does not need prior privileged access to the device.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory lists the specific affected devices and firmware versions.
- NETGEAR provides updated firmware to remediate this issue.
- The CVSS v3 vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` is provided, indicating the vulnerability characteristics.
- The vulnerability is acknowledged by Cyriac.
