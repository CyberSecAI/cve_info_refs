{
  "CVE-2018-21247": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer before 0.9.13. There is an information leak (of uninitialized memory contents) in the libvncclient/rfbproto.c ConnectToRFBRepeater function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ConnectToRFBRepeater` function in `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` uses `snprintf` to format a string into a buffer, `tmphost`. The size of the buffer is then passed to `WriteToRFBServer`, resulting in transmission of uninitialized buffer content when the formatted string doesn't fill the buffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Leak through uninitialized memory content",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exposes uninitialized memory contents from the server to the client, potentially revealing sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can connect to a vulnerable LibVNCServer and trigger the vulnerable code path within `ConnectToRFBRepeater` to leak server memory."
