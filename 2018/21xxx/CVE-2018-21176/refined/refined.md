The provided content is related to a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability in several Netgear router and gateway models. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a post-authentication stack overflow. This means the overflow occurs after a user has successfully logged into the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** A buffer overflow on the stack memory region allows an attacker to overwrite return addresses or other data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful stack overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable device.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** This can lead to complete control of the device, including data theft, modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is likely network-based, as it targets network devices.
*   **Post-Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable after successful authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for the device's web interface or other authenticated services.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
The following products are affected if running firmware versions prior to the specified versions:
*   D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
*   R6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.20
