this is an awesome plugin with. I tried several plugins for woocommerce registration but nothing worked. finally, this plugin did the job well.
but only one problem woocommerce new user mail is triggered along with user activation link email there is no option to add delay to woocommerce mail after most of the plugins have this option.
I appreciate it if this option would be added to the next update.
thankyou for the plugin.

As others stated, it does work with the native WP php mail functionality and also with other smtp mail plugins. Just make sure you work through all steps and fill the email body with text. Great plugin!!!

Plenty of complaints from people who have not configured the plugin before complaining that it doesn’t work.
It works perfectly as described, many thanks.
The only thing this plugin could do better is to insert its verification link info into the email that woo-commerce / WP is already generating for new accounts so that there is only the one email being sent not two.
For those who are having difficulty and coming here to complain, don’t expect so much free service from someone who has written and delivered a free plugin. They have done a fantastic job and the only cost to you to use this brilliant plugin is to spend 5 minutes working out how to use it.
Consider:
Emails getting Spammed – not the plugins fault, look at your email delivery system (WPMail or SMTP etc) and the content of the email (say spammy things and it will look like spam) – nothing this plugin will cause the emails generated to be seen as spam, they are simply sending the text you put in through the delivery system you are providing from the address you are asking…
Email not sending – Have you configured the text to be sent… if the email being generated is missing a body due to lack of configuration, the wordpress system may not send it or the email servers may reject it, or mark it as spam
Not working with ‘WP Mail SMTP’ or other mail generation plugin – again not the plugin, if your WordPress email system is set up correctly it will work properly – the plugin is simply sending an email through the mail generation functions provided by WordPress – if you have set up an alternative SMTP or other plugin then this email is being hijacked by said SMTP plugin to be handled in a particular way. The Email Verification plugin is simply telling WordPress to send some text as an email if WordPress won’t send it then its something to do with your WordPress setup
