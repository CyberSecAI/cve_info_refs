The provided content is a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in NETGEAR R7800 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The advisory indicates a "post-authentication command injection" vulnerability, meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system after successfully authenticating.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the device. The CVSS vector indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the router (e.g., local network).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account to authenticate to the device (PR:H - High privileges required).
- No user interaction is needed (UI:N).
- The vulnerability is present in firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.60 for R7800 routers.

**CVSS v3 Rating:**
- Medium
- CVSS v3 Score: 6.8
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
