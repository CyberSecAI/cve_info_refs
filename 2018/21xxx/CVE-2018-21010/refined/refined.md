Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the width and height of image components within the `color_apply_icc_profile` function located in `src/bin/common/color.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash).
- Other undefined behavior.
- Potentially arbitrary code execution (as stated in the Gentoo Security Advisory, although not specifically detailed in the Debian advisory).

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JP2 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JP2 file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by OpenJPEG.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenJPEG versions prior to 2.4.0 and 1.5.2-r1.
- The patch addresses the insufficient validation of image component dimensions during ICC profile application, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow. The fix specifically deals with an issue in the `color_apply_icc_profile` function where a lack of proper bounds checking on the image dimensions causes memory corruption. The Github commit message mentions "avoid potential heap buffer overflow".
- The issue was fixed in version 2.1.0-2+deb8u8 for Debian 8 "Jessie".
- Gentoo's advisory indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable and has "normal" severity.
- The provided code diff highlights changes related to memory allocation for image data buffers.
