This document is a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, and it **does not** mention a specific CVE.  However, this vulnerability is assigned the identifier **PSV-2017-0607**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection. The specific method of injection is not mentioned.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. The impact is rated as high (CVSS v3 base score 6.8), which suggests the vulnerability allows for full compromise of the system (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts are all high).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device (PR:H), and no user interaction is required (UI:N). This means that an attacker with valid credentials on the device can exploit this flaw.
