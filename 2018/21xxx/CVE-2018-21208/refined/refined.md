This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Pre-authentication command injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.
- The impact is rated as High with CVSS v3 score of 8.8 and a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
- No privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) are required for the attack to succeed.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability (pre-authentication).

**Affected Devices:**
The following NETGEAR router models are affected:
*   D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.57
*   R6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.20
*   R7500v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.24
*   WNDR4300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
*   WNDR4500v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50

The advisory recommends that users update to the latest firmware version to mitigate this vulnerability.
