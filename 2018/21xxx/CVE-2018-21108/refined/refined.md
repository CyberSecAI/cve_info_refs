- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges on the affected device, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, and an attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the web interface of the Netgear router.
