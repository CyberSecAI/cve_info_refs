The provided content is related to a security misconfiguration vulnerability in multiple NETGEAR router, gateway, and extender models. Although the advisory doesn't explicitly mention a CVE ID, it does reference the internal identifier PSV-2016-0102 and lists vulnerable products and firmware versions, along with a CVSS v3 score and vector. It also provides information on how to download the latest firmware to remediate the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Security Misconfiguration

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a security misconfiguration in the affected NETGEAR devices.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is rated as medium, with partial confidentiality, integrity, and no availability impact according to the CVSS score. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information (limited) and/or data modification (limited).

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to communicate on the same network segment as the vulnerable NETGEAR device, and user interaction is required (UI:R) for successful exploitation. The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N) on the device.
