The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability, which is likely related to CVE-2018-21199.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a stack overflow vulnerability that occurs after successful authentication on the affected Netgear devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: A buffer overflow occurs on the stack, potentially leading to the overwriting of return addresses or other critical data on the stack.
- Post-authentication vulnerability: This vulnerability can be exploited only by an attacker who has already successfully authenticated to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the device by executing arbitrary code.
- Data compromise: Attackers could potentially access sensitive information on the device.
- Denial of service: The device could crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a network-based attack.
- An authenticated user of the router could trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets/data to a vulnerable interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the router's web interface or another management interface.
- The attacker must have network access to the device (e.g., on the local network or through a port forward).
- The attacker has to send malicious input to the device to trigger the overflow.

**Affected Products:**
- D7800 (firmware prior to 1.0.1.30)
- R6100 (firmware prior to 1.0.1.22)
- R7500 (firmware prior to 1.0.0.122)
- R7500v2 (firmware prior to 1.0.3.24)
- R7800 (firmware prior to 1.0.2.40)
- R9000 (firmware prior to 1.0.2.52)
- WNDR4300 (firmware prior to 1.0.2.98)

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates that the vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but requires high privileges to exploit. The attack complexity is low and the attack is adjacent.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "mongo" on Bugcrowd.
- Netgear recommends updating to the latest firmware versions for affected devices to mitigate the risk.
