Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-21034:

**Verification:**

The content directly references `CVE-2018-21034` in a comment within a merged pull request, indicating it's related to the identified vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Argo CD's initial behavior of displaying Kubernetes secret values in plain text within its UI, treating them as regular Kubernetes objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Kubernetes secrets, which often contain sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens, were being displayed without redaction.
- **Lack of Proper Access Control:** The initial implementation lacked specific RBAC rules to restrict the viewing of secret values, allowing users with general access to potentially view sensitive information they shouldn't.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive information stored in Kubernetes secrets, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or compromise of systems and applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **UI Access:** An attacker would need access to the Argo CD UI to view the exposed secret values. This access might be gained through compromised credentials or by exploiting other vulnerabilities in the Argo CD deployment or network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Argo CD UI:** The attacker must have the ability to log in to the Argo CD UI.
- **Knowledge of Kubernetes Secrets:** While not strictly required, a basic understanding of how Kubernetes secrets are used would allow an attacker to more effectively utilize the exposed data.

**Additional Details (from the content):**

- **Resolution:** The vulnerability was addressed by implementing redaction of secret values and enhancing RBAC rules. The fix is described in the commit message as "fix: redact secret values of manifests stored in git."
- **Code Modification:**  The fix involved modifying the `diff.go` file, specifically by adding logic to mask the sensitive data with "++++++" and "++++++++++++++" characters in the UI.
- **Three-way diff:** The patch ensures that differences in secret data between the target, live, and last-applied configuration are preserved. For example, if all three values are the same they will have the same number of plus characters, but different values will have varying numbers of plus characters.
- **Code Coverage:** The pull request shows that a minor decrease in test coverage resulted from this change, indicating the modification may require further testing and coverage.
- **Timeline:** The issue was initially reported in July 2018 and fixed in February 2020.
