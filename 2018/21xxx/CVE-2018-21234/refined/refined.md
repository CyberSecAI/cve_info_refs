{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Jodd JSON parser supports polymorphic deserialization using class metadata. When parsing JSON from an untrusted source with class metadata enabled, it could lead to remote code execution by instantiating arbitrary classes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of proper input validation/sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted JSON payload with class metadata to a vulnerable application using Jodd JSON parser."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send a crafted JSON payload to a vulnerable application.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the `setClassMetadataName` option is enabled, allowing the JSON parser to deserialize JSON into specified classes using the provided metadata (e.g., '__class'). This can be exploited by injecting a malicious class name, causing arbitrary class instantiation."
