The provided content is related to CVE-2018-21098.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows for command injection after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, leading to complete compromise of the device (High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have a high level of privileges on the device (PR:H) i.e. has already authenticated. User interaction (UI) is not required (UI:N). The scope of the attack is unchanged (S:U), meaning the attacker cannot reach other devices.
