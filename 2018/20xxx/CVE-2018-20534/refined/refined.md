{
  "CVE-2018-20534": {
    "description": "There is an illegal address access at ext/testcase.c in libsolv.a in libsolv through 0.7.2 that will cause a denial of service.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libsolv"
    ],
    "root_cause": "An illegal address access due to a malformed input that is processed by `testcase_str2solvid` in `ext/testcase.c` which is then passed to `pool_whatprovides` in `src/pool.h` causing a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Illegal memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to a crash. The issue is in the test suite and not the underlying library, so exploitation in real-world scenarios is considered unlikely.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "malformed input file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide the crafted input file."
