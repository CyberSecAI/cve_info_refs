Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2018-20302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `order` query parameter in the `/ressources` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application directly echoes back unsanitized input from the `order` parameter into the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
- **Data theft:** Malicious scripts can steal sensitive data, potentially including cookies or other session information.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site or modify the page's content to perform a phishing attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL, by adding the crafted payload to the `order` query parameter of the vulnerable `/ressources` endpoint, and tricking a user into visiting it.
  -  Example: `http://host/ressources?order=%27><script>alert(1);</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload within the vulnerable `order` parameter.
- **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to click on the malicious link. This can be done through email, messaging platforms, or other means. The victim needs to be authenticated or have a valid session for an attacker to leverage the vulnerability further.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided Github content gives more details than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable parameter and an example exploit URL.
- The vulnerability was reported in issue #18 of the `smpallen99/xain` repository.
- A patch was implemented in version 0.6.2 or later.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS stemming from unsanitized input in the `order` query parameter. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs that, when visited, execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to various security compromises.
