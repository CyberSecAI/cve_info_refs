  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "shells.systems_5b32bdd3_20250124_232650.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the public community parameter when adding a new device in LibreNMS. The application allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the SNMP community string. This string is later used in a popen call, which results in remote code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized user input in the 'community' parameter when adding a new device.",
        "Use of popen function with user-controlled input, allowing for command injection."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the 'community' field when adding a new device.",
        "Attacker then triggers the execution of this command by requesting a capture, which uses the injected community string in a popen call."

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid authentication to access the add device functionality."
