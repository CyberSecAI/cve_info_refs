Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the API endpoints `GET /projects/:id/jobs` and `GET /projects/:id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/jobs`. Specifically, the `authorize_read_builds!` check was not implemented in the code for these endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The API endpoints fail to verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to access job information.
*   **Information Leakage:** This lack of authorization allows unauthorized users to retrieve sensitive data related to CI jobs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to CI Job Information:** Guest users, who should have limited access to private project information, can view details of CI jobs.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The leaked information includes commits, commit messages, branch names, tag names, and other details related to project builds. This information can be used to understand the project structure, code changes, and development process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Request:** The attacker leverages the API endpoints using a guest user's private token.
*   **Direct API access:** Attacker sends a `GET` request to the vulnerable endpoints, specifically:
    *   `GET /projects/:id/jobs`
    *   `GET /projects/:id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/jobs`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Access:** The attacker needs to be added as a guest user to the private project.
*   **API Token:** The attacker must have the guest user's private API token.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the GitLab instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by xanbanx via HackerOne.
*   The affected GitLab version was 11.5.0 RC12.
*   The suggested fix involves adding the `authorize_read_builds!` check to the implementation of the mentioned API endpoints.
*   The issue was reported on November 19, 2018.
*   The provided code snippet from `jobs.rb` shows the location of the vulnerability.
