[Redacted] is one of the largest seller in Air Conditioners in Middle East, China, North America, South America and Asia. With the rapid change in technology [Redacted] decided to provide an application which will be connected to the Internet and for customer’s ease they can manage their Air Conditioner from application.

![]()

Sounds great news? Well it is. You can manage different profiles from your single application. For example, In summers while you’re leaving for home and you want to turn on your room air conditioner so you don’t have to come home and manually start it, All you need is few clicks and voila!

The application has brought ease to some extent. But, for once did anyone thought of privacy or application security as how all of this would be managed since the application will be exposing your Air conditioner over the internet?

![]()

Having instinct to really look into application security which involves customer’s private data, I found certain modules worth concerning for somebody like me to dig down and find out how the application architecture works and how does it conceals/protects customer’s data. A Basic enumeration brought me to the point that all the devices/air conditioners registered via application are presented to the back-end administrator on a dashboard which further is divided according to the region. For instance, if someone from North America has registered their device through app, the back-end panel administrator would easily be able to view the details and activity.
(Screenshot attached, removed private data as I don’t want to expose customer’s confidential data in public).

![]()

So my device is being monitored/watched by the [Redacted] authorities? YES you’re right. This CMS provide an insight about the user’s location, IP address and other critical details that pertained to customer.

While in all of this, I forgot to mention the android application uses insecure methodologies for data communication i.e. the APIs are travelling over HTTP with no SSL pinning. Anyone with malicious intentions can intercept or read the traffic going to and from the application and can get credentials easily. Wait? Is it for real, YES it is. All you need is the token and you can modify details. Just in the example below an attempt was made to modify Nickname

![]()![]()![]()

This is not limited to only mentioned above. If you want to delete your account, you’re asked for current password. Sadly, it doesn’t validate current password entered, hence deleting account without authorization.

Oh yeah, The signatures for example **dataVC** and all, here’s the snippet of code that generates signatures to validate requests.

With a little enumeration of their web server, I was able to find directory of IIS hosting web application.

January 3, 2025New to Gree with 6 Gree Mini Splits. App seems to control all units well. Recent update is a definite improvement. Would like to see the ability to schedule based on time, A home/away ability based on phone and to have more control over the Auto function. Current temperature display would be nice to display as well. Would like to have the option to select all 3 of the sleep modes.Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIsvXOqL3MrgC3RIbRWb2cMX3DbYM2PLiTC4Y6RGXXuVkC2aA=s32-rw-mo)Darko Atanasoski*more\_vert*

January 11, 2025Delta T is too high for good comfort. It is 3 degrees celsius. So this should be at most 1 degree. Or even less. Hysteresis need to be configurable. So if i set temp to 22 (heating), it heats to 24 and then stops until it fall to 21. That is not good. Also outdoor temperature may be shown in the app. Indoor temp is good to be shown in stand by ie. Off mode. Like on Toshiba maybe.....Did you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVQYreLZFjuLGtPb0ShY50B8SZWiQZhqToc28NxsE8wVWDiOF0=s32-rw)Ronald Palmer*more\_vert*

December 7, 2024I am controlling a Tosot mini-split. This app will log off, and when you sign back in it does not have assigned to settings like Fahrenheit. It is hard to locate edit functions like adding a device to a room. My device shows as "virtual" and is not assigned to a room, but can't figure out how to assign it to a room. Perhaps I would have to Un-install and then re-install the app to accomplish this, instead of editing it. Perhaps the least user friendly app I have ever used.2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
