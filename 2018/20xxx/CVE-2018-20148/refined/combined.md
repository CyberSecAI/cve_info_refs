# WordPress plugs bug that led to Google indexing some user passwords

WordPress 5.0.1 also fixes seven security vulnerabilities.

A week after releasing its first major update in quite some time, the WordPress team has pushed the first security patch for its brand new [WordPress 5.0 branch](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/wordpress-5-0-is-out-heres-a-tour-of-the-new-features/).

Released hours ago, WordPress version 5.0.1 fixes seven security vulnerabilities (some of which allow site takeover) but also plugs a pretty serious privacy leak.

**Also: [A botnet of over 20,000 WordPress sites is attacking other WordPress sites](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-botnet-of-over-20000-wordpress-sites-is-attacking-other-wordpress-sites/)**

The latter was found by the authors of the popular Yoast SEO plugin, who discovered that in some cases the activation screen for new users could end up being indexed by Google.

With specially crafted Google searches, an attacker could find these pages and collect users' email addresses, and in some rare cases, default-generated passwords.

This leak could have catastrophic consequences if the user has an admin role or if the user didn't change his default password, as is regularly advised.

On top of this, WordPress 5.0.1 also adds support for a stronger MIME validation process for uploaded files.

"Prior to 5.0.1, WordPress did not require uploaded files to pass MIME type verification, so files could be uploaded even if the contents didn't match the file extension. For example, a binary file could be uploaded with a .jpg extension," said Ian Dunn, a WordPress CMS developer.

"This is no longer the case, and the content of uploaded files must now match their extension. Most valid files should be unaffected, but there may be cases when a file needs to be renamed to its correct extension (e.g., an OpenOffice doc going from .pptx to .ppxs)," Dunn said.

The WordPress team improved its MIME validation process after two security researchers, Tim Coen and Slavco, discovered that authors on Apache-hosted sites could upload specifically crafted files that bypass MIME verification, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

On top of this, Coen also discovered that WordPress users could edit new comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and that specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances. In this latter case, the WordPress CMS itself was not affected, but Coen said WordPress plugins could be impacted in some scenarios.

But the biggest of the seven security flaws reported to the WordPress team and fixed in v5.0.1 is an issue found by Sam Thomas from Secarma Labs, about which ZDNet wrote this past August --more details [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/wordpress-vulnerability-affects-a-third-of-most-popular-websites-online/)-- and which can lead to full site takeovers.

On top of this, the WordPress team also fixed two bugs reported by RIPS Technologies. One bug could allow authors to alter meta data to delete files that they weren't authorized to, and the second allowed authors to create unauthorized posts.

Today's fixes have also been ported to the older 4.x branch, users of which received version 4.9.9 to address the reported problems.

# WordPress 5.0.1 Security Release

---

WordPress 5.0.1 is now available. This is a **security release** for all versions since WordPress 3.7. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

Plugin authors are encouraged to [read the 5.0.1 developer notes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/13/backwards-compatibility-breaks-in-5-0-1/) for information on backwards-compatibility.

WordPress versions 5.0 and earlier are affected by the following bugs, which are fixed in version 5.0.1. Updated versions of WordPress 4.9 and older releases are also available, for users who have not yet updated to 5.0.

* [Karim El Ouerghemmi](https://ripstech.com) discovered that authors could alter meta data to delete files that they weren’t authorized to.
* Simon Scannell of [RIPS Technologies](https://blog.ripstech.com) discovered that authors could create posts of unauthorized post types with specially crafted input.
* [Sam Thomas](https://twitter.com/_s_n_t) discovered that contributors could craft meta data in a way that resulted in PHP object injection.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) discovered that contributors could edit new comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) also discovered that specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances. WordPress itself was not affected, but plugins could be in some situations.
* [Team Yoast](https://yoast.com/) discovered that the user activation screen could be indexed by search engines in some uncommon configurations, leading to exposure of email addresses, and in some rare cases, default generated passwords.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) and [Slavco](https://medium.com/websec) discovered that authors on Apache-hosted sites could upload specifically crafted files that bypass MIME verification, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Thank you to all of the reporters for [privately disclosing the vulnerabilities](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/), which gave us time to fix them before WordPress sites could be attacked.

[Download WordPress 5.0.1](https://wordpress.org/download/), or venture over to `Dashboard → Updates` and click `Update Now`. Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update automatically.

In addition to the security researchers mentioned above, thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 5.0.1:

Package        : wordpress
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20147 CVE-2018-20148 CVE-2018-20149 CVE-2018-20150
                 CVE-2018-20151 CVE-2018-20152 CVE-2018-20153 CVE-2019-8942
Debian Bug     : 916403

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) and PHP injections attacks, delete files, leak
potentially sensitive data, create posts of unauthorized types, or
cause denial-of-service by application crash.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Severe vulnerability exposes WordPress websites to attack

Researchers say the PHP security flaw could leave countless WordPress websites open to exploit.
  ![charlie-osborne](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/0cc8cfa045f11cb6ae2ebb491c5f0331f4630647/2022/08/05/2e4c50de-700f-4193-ab8f-046747723cf0/charlie-osborne.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Charlie Osborne, Contributing Writer](/meet-the-team/charlie-osborne/)  Aug. 16, 2018 at 9:38 a.m. PT

A severe WordPress vulnerability which has been left a year without being patched has the potential to disrupt countless websites running the CMS, researchers claim.

At the BSides technical cybersecurity conference in Manchester on Thursday, [Secarma](https://www.secarma.co.uk/) researcher Sam Thomas said the bug permits attackers to exploit the WordPress PHP framework, resulting in a full system compromise.

If the domain permits the upload of files, such as image formats, attackers can upload a crafted thumbnail file in order to trigger a file operation through the "phar://" stream wrapper.

In turn, the exploit triggers eXternal Entity (XXE -- XML) and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws which cause unserialization in the platform's code. While these flaws may only originally result in information disclosure and may be low risk, they can act as a pathway to a more serious remote code execution attack.

The security researcher says the core vulnerability, which is yet to receive a CVE number, is within the wp\_get\_attachment\_thumb\_file function in /wpincludes/post.php and when attackers gain control of a parameter used in the "file\_exists" call," the bug can be triggered.

Unserialization occurs when serialized variables are converted back into PHP values. When autoloading is in place, this can result in code being loaded and executed, an avenue attackers may exploit in order to compromise PHP-based frameworks.

"Unserialization of attacker-controlled data is a known critical vulnerability, potentially resulting in the execution of malicious code," the company says.

The issue of unserialization was first uncovered back in 2009, and since then, vulnerabilities have been recognized in which the integrity of PHP systems can be compromised, such as [CVE-2017-12934](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12934), [CVE-2017-12933](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12933), and [CVE-2017- 12932](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12932).

The WordPress content management system (CMS) is used by millions of webmasters to manage domains, which means the vulnerability potentially has a vast victim pool should the flaw being exploited in the wild.

"I've highlighted that the unserialization is exposed to a lot of vulnerabilities that might have previously been considered quite low-risk," Thomas explainde. "Issues which they might have thought were fixed with a configuration change or had been considered quite minor previously might need to be reevaluated in the light of the attacks I demonstrated."

According to Secarma, the CMS provider was made aware of the security issue in February 2017, but "is yet to take action."

**TechRepublic: [The need for speed: Why you should optimize your CMS](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-need-for-speed-why-you-should-optimize-your-cms/)**

Technical details have been [provided in a white paper](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3853213/us-18-Thomas-It%27s-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-....pdf) (.PDF).

"This research continues a worrying recent trend, in demonstrating that object (un)serialization is an integral part of several modern languages," Thomas said. "We must constantly be aware of the security impact of such mechanisms being exposed to attackers."

No reports have been received which suggest the exploit is being actively used in the wild.

The vulnerability was originally reported through the WordPress HackerOne [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/wordpress) last year. The issue was confirmed after several days and Thomas was credited for his findings.

However, a Secarma spokesperson told ZDNet that while there was "some attempt to fix the issue" in May 2017, this did not address the problem.

"Communication then went dead for a number of months and has only recently begun again," the spokesperson added.

ZDNet has reached out to WordPress and will update if we hear back.

Debian Bug     : 916403

CVE-2018-20147

    Authors could modify metadata to bypass intended restrictions on
    deleting files.

CVE-2018-20148
    Contributors could conduct PHP object injection attacks via crafted
    metadata in a wp.getMediaItem XMLRPC call. This is caused by
    mishandling of serialized data at phar:// URLs in the
    wp_get_attachment_thumb_file function in wp-includes/post.php.

CVE-2018-20149

    When the Apache HTTP Server is used, authors could upload crafted
    files that bypass intended MIME type restrictions, leading to XSS,
    as demonstrated by a .jpg file without JPEG data.

CVE-2018-20150

    Crafted URLs could trigger XSS for certain use cases involving
    plugins.

CVE-2018-20151

    The user-activation page could be read by a search engine's web
    crawler if an unusual configuration were chosen. The search engine
    could then index and display a user's e-mail address and (rarely)
    the password that was generated by default.

CVE-2018-20152

    Authors could bypass intended restrictions on post types via crafted
    input.

CVE-2018-20153

    Contributors could modify new comments made by users with greater
    privileges, possibly causing XSS.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.25+dfsg-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
