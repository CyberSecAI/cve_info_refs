### @manasmbellani **[manasmbellani](/manasmbellani)** commented [Dec 28, 2018](#issue-394538237)

Dear Repository maintainer,

Hope you are going well and had a Merry Christmas.

Administrator/index.php,user/index.php(fix): Added mysqli\_real\_escape\_string function to prevent authentication bypass issues for Administrator/user logins.

Without applying this temporary fix, it is possible for users to bypass authentication pages for user/ and Administrator/ and login as any user without knowing the password. PoC can be provided if required.

Please note that in future, use of Prepared statements in PHP is a better/more secure fix and will help to remove any other instances of sql injection.

I would like to release the PoC exploit after 2 weeks (14 days) - could you please let me know on manasmbellani@gmail if you have any queries, concerns or issues with the requested fix. I would recommend pulling this branch version and updating to the latest as soon as possible.

I will also be requesting a CVE number via CVE Mitre for this bug.

Wish you a very Happy New Year!

Thanks and Kind Regards,

Manas Bellani
