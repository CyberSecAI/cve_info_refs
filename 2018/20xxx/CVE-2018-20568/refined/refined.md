The provided content describes a vulnerability related to authentication bypass through SQL injection in a CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs in the login forms for both administrator and regular user accounts. Specifically, the application was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the absence of input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. User-supplied data was directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or prepared statements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker could bypass the authentication mechanism without knowing the correct credentials and gain access as any user, including administrator accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Login Forms: The attack vector is through the login forms of the administrator and user interfaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to submit arbitrary input to the login forms of the vulnerable CMS. No other special capabilities or position are explicitly mentioned but the attacker should be able to identify the vulnerable parameters in the login form.
