Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20806:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `$action` parameter in the `main.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized `$action` parameter is directly reflected back into the HTML title tag of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page's title tag. When a user visits the crafted URL, their browser executes this script, which can lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Accessing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information used by the site.
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing user data or credentials.
    *   **Page manipulation:** Altering the content of the HTML page, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `$action` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick the victim into clicking it. This can be done via social engineering, phishing emails, or embedding the link on another website.
*   The attacker does not need to have direct access to the server or the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL is described as: `<http://localhost/phamm/public/main.php?action=%3C/title%3E%3Cbody%20onload=alert(1)%3E%3C/body%3E>`
*   The payload `</title><body onload=alert(1)></body>` is injected into the title tag which triggers a javascript alert box when the page loads, demonstrating the vulnerability.
