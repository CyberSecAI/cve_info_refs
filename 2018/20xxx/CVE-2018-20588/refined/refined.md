Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a global-buffer-overflow in the `unicodeconv.c` file of the `otfcc` library. Specifically, it's a read operation that attempts to access memory outside the bounds of a global string literal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The code attempts to read 95 bytes from a global string literal that is only 1 byte in size, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The immediate impact of the overflow is a crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output and the program aborting.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided information only shows a crash, global buffer overflows can often be exploited for more serious consequences such as arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical data structures.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted OTF file using the `otfccdump` tool. This file acts as the attack vector, causing the vulnerable code path to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious OTF file to the `otfccdump` tool to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability occurs in `unicodeconv.c` at line 40, specifically in a read operation, attempting to access 95 bytes at address `0x0000008be881`, right after a string literal of size 1 byte located at address `0x0000008be880`. The string literal is an empty string: `''`.
- **Tool:** The vulnerable tool is `otfccdump`.
- **Input File:** The provided POC file `2018-12-30-01-global-buffer-overflow.otf` can trigger the vulnerability.
- **ASan Output:** The AddressSanitizer output provides detailed information on the location of the overflow, the size of the read, and the stack trace that leads to the crash.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `otfcc` library triggered by providing a specially crafted OTF file to the `otfccdump` tool, leading to a program crash. It occurs due to reading beyond the boundaries of a small global string literal during unicode conversion.
