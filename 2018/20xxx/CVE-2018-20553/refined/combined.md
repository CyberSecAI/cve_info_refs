Bug [#520](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/pull/520) Fix heap overflow on zero or 0xFFFF packet length

```
Add check for packets that report zero packet length. Example
of fix:

    src/tcpprep --auto=bridge --pcap=poc16-get_l2len-heapoverflow --cachefile=/dev/null
    Warning: poc16-get_l2len-heapoverflow was captured using a snaplen of 17 bytes.  This may mean you have truncated packets.
    safe_pcap_next ERROR: Invalid packet length in tcpprep.c:process_raw_packets() line 334: packet length=0 capture length=0
```
