Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20553.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient checks on packet lengths within the `tcpreplay` tool, specifically in the `packet2tree()` and `get_l2len()` functions. When processing packets with a length of 0 or 0xFFFF, heap-buffer-overflows occur.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `packet2tree()`: A read operation of size 4 bytes is performed at a memory address that is outside the allocated buffer. This occurs when processing a crafted packet which results in a read beyond the allocated buffer in `tree.c`.
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `get_l2len()`: A read operation of size 2 bytes is performed at a memory address that is outside the allocated buffer. This occurs due to a crafted packet which leads to out-of-bounds reads in `get.c`.
- Insufficient input validation: The code does not properly validate the length of packets it receives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a heap-buffer-overflow, which can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
- The provided ASAN logs demonstrate that the program aborts upon encountering the heap-buffer-overflow, causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted PCAP file to the `tcpprep` tool.
- The crafted PCAP file contains packets with invalid lengths that trigger the buffer overflows in affected functions during packet processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to `tcpprep`, either via a file or potentially other means (though the provided context only demonstrates a file based vector).
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be in a privileged position as the vulnerability is within the application's code itself.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information includes two Proof-of-Concept (POC) files which trigger these specific vulnerabilities.
- The patch for this vulnerability includes adding checks to ensure that the packet length is valid before processing the packet using `safe_pcap_next` and `safe_pcap_next_ex` functions. These checks are specifically aimed at preventing zero-length packets from being processed and resulting in the overflow.
- The fix was implemented and merged into version 4.3.1.
