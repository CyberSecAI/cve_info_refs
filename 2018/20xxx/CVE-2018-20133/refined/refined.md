Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-20133:

**Summary:**
The provided content is a GitHub issue report detailing a vulnerability in the `ymlref.api.load` method, which allows for arbitrary python command execution. This matches the description of CVE-2018-20133 (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20133) which states it is "a YAML-based arbitrary command execution vulnerability".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure usage of the `yaml.load()` function within the `ymlref.api.load` method in `ymlref/api.py`. Specifically, it's vulnerable to the `!!python/object/apply` tag, which allows execution of arbitrary Python code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** Using `yaml.load` without disabling dangerous tags.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary python code through crafted YAML input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable application is running. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor crafts a YAML string containing the `!!python/object/apply` tag with malicious code and provides this to the `ymlref.api.load` method, likely as user-controlled input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to pass a crafted YAML string to the `ymlref.api.load` function. This could be through various means, including user input, configuration files or data received via network.

**Technical Details:**
The provided PoC code demonstrates the issue:
```python
import ymlref.api
test_str ='!!python/object/apply:os.system ["dir"]'
ymlref.api.load(test_str)
```
This code snippet shows how an attacker can use the `!!python/object/apply` tag to execute the `os.system("dir")` command, demonstrating arbitrary command execution.
