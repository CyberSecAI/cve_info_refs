Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `sbrDecodeSingleFramePS` function within the `libfaad/sbr_dec.c` file of the FAAD2 library. Specifically, a memory access error is triggered at line 601 of the `sbr_dec.c` file. The root cause is an invalid memory address dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Access:** The core issue is an invalid memory address dereference, leading to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV). This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash caused by the invalid memory access will lead to the termination of the program, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The provided Debian Security Advisory suggests that crafted MPEG AAC files can potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, though this specific instance just causes a crash. The Gentoo advisory also notes that "the worst of which could result in the arbitrary execution of code."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Audio File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG AAC audio file. The provided POC file (`007-invalid-def-sbr_hfadj_601`) can trigger this crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious File:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable FAAD2 application with a malicious crafted AAC file for processing. This could be through a variety of attack vectors depending on how the application is used, including a web server, local file processing, or in a multimedia application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The GitHub issue includes a crash report with the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output which pinpoints the issue to line 601 of `sbr_dec.c`.
*   The vulnerability is present in FAAD2 versions prior to 2.9.0.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4522-1) and Gentoo Security Advisory mention this CVE as part of a larger batch of vulnerabilities affecting FAAD2.
