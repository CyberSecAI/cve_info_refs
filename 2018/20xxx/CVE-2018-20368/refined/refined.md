- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. It stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the `name` field within the `MSPanel.Settings` value on the `callback`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent XSS vulnerability in the Master Slider WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `name` input field in the `MSPanel.Settings` on `callback` is vulnerable to script injection.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects, and persistent manipulation of the affected module context or connected modules.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is located on the application side. The malicious script is injected via a POST request to `admin-ajax.php`. The XSS payload is triggered on the master-slider listing page after the insert or edit action.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a privileged web application user account (authenticated user) and requires low user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
