Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-20546:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An illegal READ memory access occurs in the `get_rgba_default` function within `caca/dither.c` of the `libcaca` library. Specifically, the issue arises when handling the default bits-per-pixel (bpp) case. This occurs when a specially crafted image is processed by `libcaca` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer when the default bpp case is encountered during image dithering. This can lead to a crash or potentially expose sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service: The most immediate impact is a crash of the application using `libcaca` due to the segmentation fault. This can be triggered by providing a crafted image as input. This is a more likely outcome from the bug, according to the data.
*   Information exposure: While the primary impact is denial of service, a read beyond the buffer may lead to some form of information exposure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Image processing: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed image file with the `libcaca` library, specifically with functions related to dithering. This implies that the image file is the primary attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to supply input: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable `libcaca` library. This could be through a file upload, network service, or by simply having the target application process the malicious image.
*   No authentication required: The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication to trigger, therefore making it easily exploitable.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libcaca` version 0.99.beta19 and is confirmed by reports and test cases.
*   The provided sample BMP file is minimized to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue was initially reported in Red Hat Bugzilla and then reported upstream on GitHub issues.
*   The patch was made by Sam Hocevar on commit 1022d97 and includes a fix for integer multiplication overflows in `caca/dither.c`

The vulnerability was fixed by changes that include a bounds check of the bpp value used in `get_rgba_default`.
