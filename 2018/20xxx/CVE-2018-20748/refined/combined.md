                 CVE-2019-15681

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of iTALC, a
classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

    Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
    a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

    The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
    LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
    allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
    screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
    PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
    a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
    (2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
    rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
    cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
    attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

    Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
    client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

    Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
    allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
    payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the tile
    dimensions.

CVE-2018-6307

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2018-15126

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-15127

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in server code
    of file transfer extension that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20749

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20750

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20019

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in
    VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20748

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c. The fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    LibVNC contained CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in
    VNC Repeater client code that allowed attacker to read stack memory
    and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
    vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout and in
    bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your italc packages.

It is a fun fact that inside `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` the same code is located on line 2220, but all bugs connected with LibVNC I described in Github issues inside LibVNC repository.

Oh.  So you reported the instance of that one issue in LibVNC here:

<https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/247>

Upstream's fix appears to be to add casts to (uint64_t) before adding 1
in those many malloc() calls.  On platforms with larger than 32-bit
size_t, this should be sufficient against integer overflows since the
sizes are read from 32-bit protocol fields, but it isn't sufficient to
prevent maliciously large memory allocation on the client by a rogue
server.  On a platform with 32-bit size_t, this isn't even sufficient to
prevent the integer overflows.  If I haven't missed anything, it'd be
great if you open a new issue suggesting introduction of safety limits
prior to those malloc() lines.

The current code is:

  case rfbServerCutText:
  {
    char *buffer;

    if (!ReadFromRFBServer(client, ((char *)&msg) + 1,
			   sz_rfbServerCutTextMsg - 1))
      return FALSE;

    msg.sct.length = rfbClientSwap32IfLE(msg.sct.length);

    buffer = malloc((uint64_t)msg.sct.length+1);

    if (!ReadFromRFBServer(client, buffer, msg.sct.length)) {
      free(buffer);
      return FALSE;
    }

    buffer[msg.sct.length] = 0;

    if (client->GotXCutText)
      client->GotXCutText(client, buffer, msg.sct.length);

    free(buffer);

    break;
}

but per the commits referenced in issue #247 above, there are many more
instances of the "malloc(... + 1)" pattern, which were patched similarly
incompletely.

Thanks,

Alexander

# USN-3877-1: LibVNCServer vulnerabilities

31 January 2019

Several security issues were fixed in LibVNCServer.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [libvncserver](/security/cves?package=libvncserver) - vnc server library

## Details

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled certain operations.

A remote attacker able to connect to applications using LibVNCServer could

possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of

## Description

[![@solardiz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18089797?u=3b130ac6cebae1efd12a9f46d20e619ae3a21e9a&v=4&size=48)](/solardiz)[solardiz](https://github.com/solardiz)opened [on Dec 13, 2018](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/273#issue-390616835)

The fixes for [#247](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/247) are incomplete, as I explained in:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/12/10/8>

"Upstream's fix appears to be to add casts to (uint64\_t) before adding 1 in those many malloc() calls. On platforms with larger than 32-bit size\_t, this should be sufficient against integer overflows since the sizes are read from 32-bit protocol fields, but it isn't sufficient to prevent maliciously large memory allocation on the client by a rogue server. On a platform with 32-bit size\_t, this isn't even sufficient to prevent the integer overflows."

Edit: I've just realized the fixes were the issue reporter's, and were merely accepted upstream. But that doesn't change anything with respect to the project needing even further fixes.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC ITC Industrial Thin Clients represent powerful control terminals with high-resolution wide-screen
touch displays in 12, 15, 19 and 22 inch formats.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-18922

websockets.c in LibVNCServer prior to 0.9.12 did not properly decode certain WebSocket frames.
A malicious attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted WebSocket frames to a server,
causing a heap-based buffer overﬂow.
