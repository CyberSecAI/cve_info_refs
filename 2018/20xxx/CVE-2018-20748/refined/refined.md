Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-20748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2018-20019) related to heap out-of-bounds write in the `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` file within LibVNC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Write:** The vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds write, meaning that the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region in the heap. This can lead to memory corruption and other unexpected behavior.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix for CVE-2018-20019 was not comprehensive, leaving some vulnerable code paths unaddressed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. An attacker could inject malicious code and potentially gain control of the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service:** Out-of-bounds writes can corrupt memory, causing the application or system to crash, leading to denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly mentioned, heap corruption could, in some scenarios, lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through network connections. A remote attacker can exploit it by sending specially crafted VNC packets that trigger the out-of-bounds write.
*   **Malicious VNC Server:** The client connects to a malicious VNC server which then sends the crafted packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to a vulnerable LibVNC client, typically by acting as a rogue VNC server.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Multiple Instances:** The Debian security advisory (DLA 1652-1) mentions that the fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete and CVE-2018-20748 addresses these remaining issues.
*   **Affected Products:** The Siemens advisory (SSA-390195) confirms that this vulnerability affects several SIMATIC ITC products, highlighting the potential for real-world impact in industrial control systems.
*  **Mitigation:** The Siemens advisory recommends to restrict access to port 5900/tcp to trusted IP addresses only.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in `libvncserver` version 0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u5 (Debian) and  in SIMATIC ITC products with version V3.2.1.0 or later.
*   **Client-Side vulnerability** The vulnerability exists in `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` and not in server-side code. This means that the client is vulnerable to malicious servers.
*   **Safety Limits:** The openwall.com content mentions that simply casting to `uint64_t` does not protect against maliciously large memory allocations on the client by a rogue server.

In summary, CVE-2018-20748 is a critical vulnerability allowing for remote code execution via a heap out-of-bounds write, stemming from an incomplete fix of a prior vulnerability. It affects LibVNC client implementations and can be triggered by a malicious VNC server sending specially crafted packets.
