The provided content discusses security vulnerabilities in Nespresso Prodigio and Jura E8 coffee machines, specifically their Bluetooth implementations. While the content doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2018-20959, the vulnerabilities it describes are a type of insecure direct object reference and lack of authentication, which are common security issues. Therefore, the content is relevant to the general concept of CVE-2018-20959 although further details are required to confirm it is related.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Nespresso Prodigio**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of Bluetooth connection security.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   No Bluetooth PIN or connection trigger required for pairing.
    *   Any device within Bluetooth range can connect to the coffee machine and control it.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can remotely trigger the coffee machine to make coffee.
    *   An attacker can potentially trigger the auto-reorder feature by manipulating the minimum stock threshold.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Bluetooth communication within range of the coffee machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the coffee machine.
    *   An attacker needs a device capable of connecting to Bluetooth devices (e.g. a smartphone).
    *   No special technical expertise is required beyond the ability to download and install the official app.

**Jura E8**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of Bluetooth connection security.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   No connection security is enforced on the Bluetooth interface.
    *   Lack of authentication allows any device within range to connect.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can remotely trigger the machine to make coffee (wasting beans and water).
    *   An attacker can stop coffee making in progress.
    *   An attacker can manipulate coffee strength settings.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Bluetooth communication within range of the coffee machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the coffee machine.
    *   An attacker needs a device capable of connecting to Bluetooth devices (e.g. a smartphone).
    *  No special technical expertise is required beyond the ability to download and install the official app.

**Additional Points:**

*   The article highlights that both coffee machines lack connection security for their Bluetooth interface, allowing any device to connect and send commands.
*   The article mentions that the Jura E8 has a PIN option in the app, but it is not enforced and users rarely enable it, leaving the device vulnerable by default.
*   The article points out the lack of a simple security mechanism like a key press to initiate pairing which would mitigate the attack vectors.
*   The article also mentions the Nespresso app had the "call_phone" permission, potentially enabling silent calls.
