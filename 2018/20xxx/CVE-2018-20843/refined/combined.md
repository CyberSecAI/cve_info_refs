## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.Â  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

See "Temporarily Stopping Parsing" in the documentation for more details. - Some mostly minor bug fixes, but compilation should no longer generate warnings on most platforms. SF issues include: #827319, #840173, #846309, #888329, #896188, #923913, #928113, #961698, #985192.
Release 1.95.7 Mon Oct 20 2003 - Fixed enum XML\_Status issue (reported on SourceForge many times), so compilers that are properly picky will be happy. - Introduced an XMLCALL macro to control the calling convention used by the Expat API; this macro should be used to annotate prototypes and definitions of callback implementations in code compiled with a calling convention other than the default convention for the host platform. - Improved ability to build without the configure-generated expat\_config.h header. This is useful for applications which embed Expat rather than linking in the library. - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #458907, #609603, #676844, #679754, #692878, #692964, #695401, #699323, #699487, #820946. - Improved hash table lookups. - Added more regression tests and improved documentation.
Release 1.95.6 Tue Jan 28 2003 - Added XML\_FreeContentModel(). - Added XML\_MemMalloc(), XML\_MemRealloc(), XML\_MemFree(). - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #615606, #616863, #618199, #653180, #673791. - Enhanced the regression test suite. - Man page improvements: includes SF issue #632146.
Release 1.95.5 Fri Sep 6 2002 - Added XML\_UseForeignDTD() for improved SAX2 support. - Added XML\_GetFeatureList(). - Defined XML\_Bool type and the values XML\_TRUE and XML\_FALSE. - Use an incomplete struct instead of a void\* for the parser (may not retain). - Fixed UTF-8 decoding bug that caused legal UTF-8 to be rejected. - Finally fixed bug where default handler would report DTD events that were already handled by another handler. Initial patch contributed by Darryl Miles. - Removed unnecessary DllMain() function that caused static linking into a DLL to be difficult. - Added VC++ projects for building static libraries. - Reduced line-length for all source code and headers to be no longer than 80 characters, to help with AS/400 support. - Reduced memory copying during parsing (SF patch #600964). - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #580793, #434664, #483514, #580503, #581069, #584041, #584183, #584832, #585537, #596555, #596678, #598352, #598944, #599715, #600479, #600971.
Release 1.95.4 Fri Jul 12 2002 - Added support for VMS, contributed by Craig Berry. See vms/README.vms for more information. - Added Mac OS (classic) support, with a makefile for MPW, contributed by Thomas Wegner and Daryle Walker. - Added Borland C++ Builder 5 / BCC 5.5 support, contributed by Patrick McConnell (SF patch #538032). - Fixed a variety of bugs: see SF issues #441449, #563184, #564342, #566334, #566901, #569461, #570263, #575168, #579196. - Made skippedEntityHandler conform to SAX2 (see source comment) - Re-implemented WFC: Entity Declared from XML 1.0 spec and added a new error "entity declared in parameter entity": see SF bug report #569461 and SF patch #578161 - Re-implemented section 5.1 from XML 1.0 spec: see SF bug report #570263 and SF patch #578161
Release 1.95.3 Mon Jun 3 2002 - Added a project to the MSVC workspace to create a wchar\_t version of the library; the DLLs are named libexpatw.dll. - Changed the name of the Windows DLLs from expat.dll to libexpat.dll; this fixes SF bug #432456. - Added the XML\_ParserReset() API function. - Fixed XML\_SetReturnNSTriplet() to work for element names. - Made the XML\_UNICODE builds usable (thanks, Karl!). - Allow xmlwf to read from standard input. - Install a man page for xmlwf on Unix systems. - Fixed many bugs; see SF bug reports #231864, #461380, #464837, #466885, #469226, #477667, #484419, #487840, #494749, #496505, #547350. Other bugs which we can't test as easily may also have been fixed, especially in the area of build support.
Release 1.95.2 Fri Jul 27 2001 - More changes to make MSVC happy with the build; add a single workspace to support both the library and xmlwf application. - Added a Windows installer for Windows users; includes xmlwf.exe. - Added compile-time constants that can be used to determine the Expat version - Removed a lot of GNU-specific dependencies to aide portability among the various Unix flavors. - Fix the UTF-8 BOM bug. - Cleaned up warning messages for several compilers. - Added the -Wall, -Wstrict-prototypes options for GCC.
Release 1.95.1 Sun Oct 22 15:11:36 EDT 2000 - Changes to get expat to build under Microsoft compiler - Removed all aborts and instead return an UNEXPECTED\_STATE error. - Fixed a bug where a stray '%' in an entity value would cause an abort. - Defined XML\_SetEndNamespaceDeclHandler. Thanks to Darryl Miles for finding this oversight. - Changed default patterns in lib/Makefile.in to fit non-GNU makes Thanks to robin@unrated.net for reporting and providing an account to test on. - The reference had the wrong label for XML\_SetStartNamespaceDecl. Reported by an anonymous user.
Release 1.95.0 Fri Sep 29 2000 - XML\_ParserCreate\_MM Allows you to set a memory management suite to replace the standard malloc,realloc, and free. - XML\_SetReturnNSTriplet If you turn this feature on when namespace processing is in effect, then qualified, prefixed element and attribute names are returned as "uri|name|prefix" where '|' is whatever separator character is used in namespace processing. - Merged in features from perl-expat o XML\_SetElementDeclHandler o XML\_SetAttlistDeclHandler o XML\_SetXmlDeclHandler o XML\_SetEntityDeclHandler o StartDoctypeDeclHandler takes 3 additional parameters: sysid, pubid, has\_internal\_subset o Many paired handler setters (like XML\_SetElementHandler) now have corresponding individual handler setters o XML\_GetInputContext for getting the input context of the current parse position. - Added reference material - Packaged into a distribution that builds a sharable library

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [âCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletinsâ](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

Starting with the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. Oracle has published two versions of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update Advisory: this version of the advisory implemented the change in how non-exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party components are reported, and the âtraditionalâ advisory follows the same format as the previous advisories. The âtraditionalâ advisory is published at <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020traditional.html>.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 403Â new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2712240.1).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### @hartwork **[hartwork](/hartwork)** commented [Jun 13, 2019](#issue-455910972)

My impression is that function `setElementTypePrefix` extracts the XML namespace prefix from an XML name and puts it into `elementType->prefix` if it was able find a registered prefix for that namespace:

[libexpat/expat/lib/xmlparse.c](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/7f3291057bfc499933eddeb980ba67b9fb87834e/expat/lib/xmlparse.c#L6050-L6078)

Lines 6050 to 6078
in
[7f32910](/libexpat/libexpat/commit/7f3291057bfc499933eddeb980ba67b9fb87834e)

|  | static int |
| --- | --- |
|  | setElementTypePrefix(XML\_Parser parser, ELEMENT\_TYPE \*elementType) |
|  | { |
|  | DTD \* const dtd = parser->m\_dtd; /\* save one level of indirection \*/ |
|  | const XML\_Char \*name; |
|  | for (name = elementType->name; \*name; name++) { |
|  | if (\*name == XML\_T(ASCII\_COLON)) { |
|  | PREFIX \*prefix; |
|  | const XML\_Char \*s; |
|  | for (s = elementType->name; s != name; s++) { |
|  | if (!poolAppendChar(&dtd->pool, \*s)) |
|  | return 0; |
|  | } |
|  | if (!poolAppendChar(&dtd->pool, XML\_T('\0'))) |
|  | return 0; |
|  | prefix = (PREFIX \*)lookup(parser, &dtd->prefixes, poolStart(&dtd->pool), |
|  | sizeof(PREFIX)); |
|  | if (!prefix) |
|  | return 0; |
|  | if (prefix->name == poolStart(&dtd->pool)) |
|  | poolFinish(&dtd->pool); |
|  | else |
|  | poolDiscard(&dtd->pool); |
|  | elementType->prefix = prefix; |
|  |  |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  | return 1; |
|  | } |

Now according to this quote â¦

> [4] NCName ::= Name - (Char\* ':' Char\*) /\* An XML Name, minus the ":" \*/

â¦ from [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#NT-NCName) namespace prefixes cannot contain a colon.

It also seems that colons *should* be used in XML names for namespaces only, but do not render the name malformed if used otherwise they way I read [this](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/#dt-name):

> The Namespaces in XML Recommendation [XML Names] assigns a meaning to names containing colon characters. Therefore, authors should not use the colon in XML names except for namespace purposes, but XML processors must accept the colon as a name character.

To conclude from those two, my understanding is that we should treat all text before the first colon (if any) as a namespace prefix and treat the remainder as a name from (or relative to) that namespace, containing further colons or not.

To me, the "right" fix seems to be be to just add a `break` statement to the end if the inner `if`-block to stop after the first time we handled a colon. In my test, this patch does defuse the case of the [file attached](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/files/1664546/clusterfuzz-testcase-4543406568112128.txt) to issue [#186](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/186) while keeping the test suite happy.

Review welcome and appreciated!

### **[pointsman](/pointsman)** commented [Jul 7, 2019](#issuecomment-509037641)

| I feel a bit uneasy about the "fix" and even more so about the explanation. It is right, that in "bare" (namespace agnostic) XML documents colons (:) are allowed in element (and also) attribute names. That is: parser created with XML\_ParserCreate() should accept documents with such names (and they did and do, as far as I'm aware).  Now, if you want a parser, that accepts documents which are compliant not only to the w3c XML recommendation but also to the w3c XML namespaces recommendation the rules are a little bit adjusted. For expat this are the parsers created with XML\_ParserCreateNS().  For such documents at max *one* colon per element (or attribute) name is possible. The productions only a few lines below the place (<https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#NT-QName>) cited by hartwork are cristal clear in this regard (if one need a confirming look into the spec for such a basic fact about XML). More than colon is a well-formedness error in this case.  So, either the parser is a "bare" XML rec parser then any number of colons (not as start char, but otherwise) in an element or attribute name is OK and there is no special meaning to them. So there is no point in looking them up with SetElementTypePrefix().  Or the parser is an XML and XML namespaces aware parser. Then SetElementTypePrefix() should simply return parsing error at the second colon in a name. |

### **[hartwork](/hartwork)** commented [Jul 10, 2019](#issuecomment-509868888)

| Hi [@pointsman](https://github.com/pointsman) and [@kwaclaw](https://github.com/kwaclaw) ,  I appreciate the review and feedback. I would like to clearly separate the two topics that we might be about to mix here: (1) Whether the fix in this pull request made things better and/or worse and (2) if we can and should reject multiple colons and under what circumstances.  For (1) the security issue is fixed â that's better â and the name prefix extracted eventually now contains the the text up to but excluding the first colon rather than the last one. Given that a name prefix *cannot* contain a colon by the spec, that seems also better than before to me. Is if there is anything off in that evaluation for (1) so far?  For (2) I am happy to team up on improving the situation further. The way I read â¦  All element and attribute names contain either zero or one colon;  â¦ at [7 Conformance of Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#Conformance) supports [@pointsman](https://github.com/pointsman)'s argument. If enabling namespace support flips Expat from reporting about XML well-formedness to reporting about [namespace-well-formed](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#Conformance) I guess we need to error out with a parse error in future releases indeed.  Let me know what you think! |

  * [#186](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/186) [#262](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/262)  Fix extraction of namespace prefixes from XML names;
                      XML names with multiple colons could end up in the
                      wrong namespace, and take a high amount of RAM and CPU
                      resources while processing, opening the door to use for denial-of-service attacks
  * [#227](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/227) Autotools: Add --without-examples and --without-tests

  Full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_2_7/expat/Changes#L5).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-139fcda84d
2019-07-16 03:21:48.723385
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : expat
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 2.2.7
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <https://libexpat.github.io/>
Summary : An XML parser library
Description :
This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update includes a fix for a security vulnerability, CVE-2018-20843: > Fix
extraction of namespace prefixes from XML names; XML names with multiple colons
could end up in the wrong namespace, and take a high amount of RAM and CPU
resources while processing, opening the door to use for denial-of-service
attacks For more information on the changes in 2.2.7, see the upstream release
notes at: <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_2_7/expat/Changes#L5>

Package        : expat
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20843
Debian Bug     : 931031

It was discovered that Expat, an XML parsing C library, did not properly
handled XML input including XML names that contain a large number of
colons, potentially resulting in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

For the detailed security status of expat please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-18868e1715
2019-07-10 00:51:11.941556
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : expat
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 2.2.7
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <https://libexpat.github.io/>
Summary : An XML parser library
Description :
This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat
is a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with
the parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the
parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A
start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may
register handlers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update includes a fix for a security vulnerability, CVE\_2018-20843: > Fix
extraction of namespace prefixes from XML names; XML names with multiple colons
could end up in the wrong namespace, and take a high amount of RAM and CPU
resources while processing, opening the door to use for denial-of-service
attacks For more information on the changes in 2.2.7, see the upstream release
notes at: <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_2_7/expat/Changes#L5>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [âCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletinsâ](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 38 new security patches for Oracle Fusion Middleware.Â  30 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update October 2021 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update October 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2796575.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2796575.1).

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

# [R1] Nessus 8.15.0 Fixes Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[â View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus versions 8.14.0 and earlier for Windows were found to contain multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities which could allow an authenticated, local administrator to run specific Windows executables as the Nessus host.

Additionally, two third-party components (expat, sqlite) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution, and in line with best practice, Tenable has implemented fixes for the privilege escalation vulnerabilities, as well as upgraded the bundled third-party components to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus 8.15.0 addresses the privilege escalation issues, updates expat to version 2.2.10 and sqlite to version 3.34.1.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus 8.15.0 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : expat
Version        : 2.1.0-6+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20843
Debian Bug     : 931031

It was discovered that Expat, an XML parsing C library, did not properly
handle XML input including XML names that contain a large number of
colons, potentially resulting in denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.0-6+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

###### high

* [Information](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2019-15903)
* [CPEs](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2019-15903/cpes)
* [Plugins](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2019-15903/plugins)

#### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call to XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML\_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

Package        : expat
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20843
Debian Bug     : 931031

It was discovered that Expat, an XML parsing C library, did not properly
handled XML input including XML names that contain a large number of
colons, potentially resulting in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

For the detailed security status of expat please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Description

[![@caolanm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833656?v=4&size=48)](/caolanm)[caolanm](https://github.com/caolanm)opened [on Jan 25, 2018](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/186#issue-291613149)

valgrind --tool=massif xmlwf clusterfuzz-testcase-4543406568112128.txt

reports that xmlwf uses > 2G of memory to load this bogus xml document.

[clusterfuzz-testcase-4543406568112128.txt](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/files/1664546/clusterfuzz-testcase-4543406568112128.txt)

This was reported by oss-fuzz against LibreOffice (<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=5226>) which uses expat and has the same memory use so I felt I should pass it on.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [âCritical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletinsâ](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
