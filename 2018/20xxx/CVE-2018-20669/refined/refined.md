{
  "CVE-2018-20669": {
    "Description": "An issue where a provided address with access_ok() is not checked was discovered in i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl in drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_gem_execbuffer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. A local attacker can craft a malicious IOCTL function call to overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, resulting in a Denial of Service or privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl` function in the i915 graphics driver lacks proper validation of user-provided memory addresses, failing to perform an `access_ok()` check before accessing the memory using `unsafe_put_user`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing `access_ok()` check before using `unsafe_put_user`, leading to the ability to write to arbitrary kernel memory.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite kernel memory, leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious IOCTL function call via the `i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the system. They need to be able to make the `i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl` syscall. Low privileges are sufficient for exploitation."
