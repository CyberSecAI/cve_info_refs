Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled recursion within the `Sass::Complex_Selector::perform` function in `ast.hpp` and `Sass::Inspect::operator()` function in `inspect.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Recursion:** The core issue is an uncontrolled recursion within the specified functions, leading to a stack overflow. This is triggered when processing specially crafted Sass input.
*   **Stack Overflow:** The uncontrolled recursion leads to excessive stack usage, eventually resulting in a stack overflow error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. The program crashes due to the stack overflow, rendering it unavailable for legitimate users.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered via network access, likely by providing malicious Sass input to a system that uses the vulnerable LibSass library.
*   **Crafted Sass Input:** The attack vector relies on a crafted Sass input file that triggers the recursive behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered when user-supplied input is processed by libsass, meaning some form of user interaction is required to initiate the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Technical Details**
*   The stack overflow occurs within the `Sass::Inspect::operator()` function, specifically, when it processes nested selectors. The recursion happens when `perform` is called on `Complex_Selector`.

**Summary of SUSE Information:**

*   SUSE has rated this issue as having a moderate severity.
*   SUSE has resolved the issue in various products through package updates.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned Bugzilla entry [1133201](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1133201).
*   SUSE has released security advisories [openSUSE-SU-2019:1791-1](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce%40lists.opensuse.org/thread/YJ7FECPNTPURCXIOZ6UWOJFRTA4TVLME/#YJ7FECPNTPURCXIOZ6UWOJFRTA4TVLME), [openSUSE-SU-2019:1800-1](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce%40lists.opensuse.org/thread/TKUSHJ5N3XI2SULIOHCBE47TMJ7A5XA4/#TKUSHJ5N3XI2SULIOHCBE47TMJ7A5XA4), and [openSUSE-SU-2019:1883-1](https://lists.opensuse.org/archives/list/security-announce%40lists.opensuse.org/thread/HPU3GRLOX4PSKM4UBZP2UQ5JATS5U6U6/#HPU3GRLOX4PSKM4UBZP2UQ5JATS5U6U6) to address the vulnerability.
