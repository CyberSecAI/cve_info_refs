Patched

* `>=0.6.2`

### Description

A mistake in error handling in untrusted before 0.6.2 could lead to an integer
underflow and panic if a user of the crate didn't properly check for errors
returned by untrusted.

Combination of these two programming errors (one in untrusted and another by
user of this crate) could lead to a panic and maybe a denial of service of
affected software.

The error in untrusted is fixed in release 0.6.2 released 2018-06-21. It's also
advisable that users of untrusted check for their sources for cases where errors
returned by untrusted are not handled correctly.

```

There are actually combination of two errors:

First, there's my mistake: Proof of concept code on line

```
let some_input = input.skip_and_get_input(6);
```

doesn't check for error as it should and continues with

```
let and_the_rest = Vec::from(input.skip_to_end().as_slice_less_safe());
```

Secondly, Untrusted's error: untrusted's `Reader::skip_and_get_input()` function doesn't return error before increasing the index pointing to a buffer:

[untrusted/src/untrusted.rs](https://github.com/briansmith/untrusted/blob/44384f81a3318b13430f3976c769d4925ec9d76d/src/untrusted.rs#L316-L324)

Lines 316 to 324
in
[44384f8](/briansmith/untrusted/commit/44384f81a3318b13430f3976c769d4925ec9d76d)

|  | pub fn skip\_and\_get\_input(&mut self, num\_bytes: usize) |
| --- | --- |
|  | -> Result<Input<'a>, EndOfInput> { |
|  | let new\_i = try!(self.i.checked\_add(num\_bytes).ok\_or(EndOfInput)); |
|  | let ret = self.input.get\_slice(self.i..new\_i) |
|  | .map(|subslice| Input { value: subslice }) |
|  | .ok\_or(EndOfInput); |
|  | self.i = new\_i; |
|  | ret |
|  | } |

here line 318 calculated the new index value, then lines 319-321 try to construct new `Input`, but since this can fail there's a possibility that `ret` is `Err(EndOfInput)`. However, this error is not returned when it happens and code continues to line 322 where Reader's index (`self.i`) is increased and then `skip_and_get_input()` is done and it returns `Err(EndOfInput)`.

This allows the case where Reader's index can point to outside of buffer thus panicing later.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks. I can't believe we didn't write it this way originally. I wonder what I was thinking.

## Integer underflow in untrusted

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-wq8f-46ww-6c2h)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-wq8f-46ww-6c2h/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

untrusted
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.6.2

## Patched versions

0.6.2

## Description

A mistake in error handling in untrusted before 0.6.2 could lead to an integer underflow and panic if a user of the crate didn't properly check for errors returned by untrusted. Combination of these two programming errors (one in untrusted and another by user of this crate) could lead to a panic and maybe a denial of service of affected software. The error in untrusted is fixed in release 0.6.2 released 2018-06-21. It's also advisable that users of untrusted check for their sources for cases where errors returned by untrusted are not handled correctly.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
