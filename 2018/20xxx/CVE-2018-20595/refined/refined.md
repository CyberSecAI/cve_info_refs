Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20595.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper state validation in the `callback` method of `OAuth2ClientController.java`. Specifically, the application was not verifying if the `state` parameter received in the callback matches the `state` stored in the session, which allowed for a CSRF attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the OAuth2 authentication flow. The `state` parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account Hijacking: An attacker could potentially hijack a user's account by crafting malicious links or forms that, when clicked, would authenticate the attacker's account with the victim's credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious link or form that triggers an OAuth2 authentication flow. The attacker uses their own state value in the initial authentication request. After the user authenticates, the callback URL redirects the user to a URL controlled by the attacker with an attacker-controlled state and code. Because the application does not validate state, the attacker can successfully gain access to the victim's account.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a user into clicking on a malicious link or form.
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious OAuth2 authentication request and obtain a valid code from the OAuth2 server.
- The attacker must know the application's OAuth2 callback URL.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into using their own code and state in a request.

**Additional details:**
The provided content also mentions other security issues: reflected XSS and path traversal, but these are not related to the current CVE. The fix for the CSRF is implemented by adding a check `if (!state.equals(cachedState)) { throw new BusinessException(ErrorType.STATE_ERROR.name()); }` which compares the received `state` parameter with the one stored in session.
