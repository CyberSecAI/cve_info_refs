Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-20470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side validation in the web editor module of Sahi Pro. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within the `href` parameter of the `Log_highlight` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. By manipulating the `href` parameter, an attacker can navigate the file system of the server running Sahi Pro and access arbitrary files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper input validation on the server side. This allows malicious user-supplied input to be processed by the application without proper sanitization, leading to the directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Potential for DoS:** The content mentions that the vulnerability could also be used to include remote files, which could cause Denial of Service on victim browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read any files on the system running Sahi Pro that the application user has access to. This can include sensitive data such as configuration files, source code, password files, and other internal documents.
*   **Denial of Service:** By including remote files through the vulnerable parameter, an attacker could cause a denial of service on victim browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `href` GET parameter in the URL, specifically to the `/_s_/dyn/Log_highlight` endpoint. By modifying this parameter to include directory traversal sequences like `../`, an attacker can navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim machine running the vulnerable Sahi Pro instance. The web reports module (where the vulnerability resides) is accessible via HTTP over the network.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate HTTP GET parameters in URLs, and how to use directory traversal sequences (`../`)

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of Sahi Pro <= 8.x are affected.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the web reporting interface of Sahi Pro.
*   The vulnerable URL pattern is `http://<ip>:<port>/_s_/dyn/Log_highlight?href=../../../../windows/win.ini&n=1#selected`
*   The vendor was notified on December 8, 2018
*   A temporary fix of password protecting web reports module was suggested.
