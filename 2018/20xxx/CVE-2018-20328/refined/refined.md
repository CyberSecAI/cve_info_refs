The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20328.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the social groups page of the Chamilo LMS. Specifically, the `name` and `description` fields of a group were not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to:
- Stealing user session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Defacing the web application.
- Performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the social groups page. An attacker with the ability to create or modify groups could include malicious JavaScript code in the `name` or `description` fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be a user of the Chamilo LMS and have the capability to create or modify social groups.
