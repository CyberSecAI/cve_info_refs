The provided content relates to CVE-2018-20744, which is about insecure CORS configurations.

The first document is a research paper that comprehensively analyzes CORS vulnerabilities in design, implementation, and deployment. It identifies several issues:

Root cause of vulnerability:
- Overly permissive sending permissions for simple requests.
- Risky trust dependencies where a secure domain trusts a less secure one, or a domain trusts its own HTTP version.
- Policy complexity leading to misconfigurations.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Incomplete reference monitor: CORS allows "simple requests" by default, but these requests can include malicious modifications to HTTP headers and bodies, leading to vulnerabilities.
    -  Crafting request headers: Lack of restrictions on header values and sizes allows attackers to inject malicious payloads or infer private information via side-channel attacks by manipulating header sizes.
    -  Crafting request bodies:  Lack of limitations on body format and values enables attackers to exploit vulnerabilities (e.g., file upload CSRF) or attack binary protocol services within a network.
- Trust dependency:
    - HTTPS sites trusting their own HTTP domains:  An attacker can compromise the HTTP domain and then read sensitive content from the HTTPS domain.
    - Trusting other domains (subdomains and third-party domains): An attacker can exploit XSS on a trusted but vulnerable domain to attack a strongly secured domain by using CORS.
- Policy complexity:
    - Poor expressiveness of CORS policy:  The lack of support for multiple origins forces developers to implement complex logic, leading to errors such as blindly reflecting origins, prefix/suffix/substring matching errors, or not escaping special characters in the origin.
   - Forgeable "null" Origin values:  Attackers can forge null origin values to bypass access controls.
   - Security mechanism complexity:  Misunderstanding of CORS's restriction on combining wildcard origins with credentials leads to insecure configurations, including web frameworks bypassing the restriction.
   - Complex interactions with caching: HTTP caches don't consider CORS policies, leading to resources not being accessible if the CORS policy changes.
- Browser implementations of CORS have inconsistencies such as lack of restrictions on header values or sizes, and inconsistencies in the handling of request body data.
- Web frameworks often fail to implement CORS correctly, introducing vulnerabilities through insecure defaults or logic.
- Developers often misunderstand CORS's security mechanisms and create vulnerable configurations due to poor documentation of the security risks in the standards.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution (RCE) by crafting malicious headers.
- Privacy information leakage by inferring cookie sizes via timing side channels.
- File upload CSRF by crafting request bodies.
- Attack on internal binary-based protocol services by sending crafted binary data.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on HTTPS websites, allowing attackers to read sensitive information.
- Information theft and account hijacking by exploiting vulnerabilities on weak websites.
- Cache poisoning, denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- Web attackers can use malicious JavaScript in the victimâ€™s browser to send crafted cross-origin requests
- Network attackers can manipulate network traffic to hijack HTTP domains and read content on HTTPS domains

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Web attackers need to trick the victim into clicking a link or visiting a malicious website
- Network attackers need to be able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
- The attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable CORS implementation/configuration.

The second document is a Github issue discussing a specific instance of CORS misconfiguration, where a CORS handler reflects any origin header value when configured to "*", which is also discussed in the first document as a vulnerability. It also includes links to other resources discussing similar issues.

These two documents cover several aspects of CVE-2018-20744.
