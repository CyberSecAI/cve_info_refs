## Problem Note *63391:* The SASÂ® 9.4 Web Infrastructure Platform contains a remote-code execution vulnerability

| Details | Downloads | About | Rate It |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Severity:** Critical

**Description:** The SAS 9.4 Web Infrastructure Platform is vulnerable to remote code execution via a Java de-serialization variant.

**Potential Impact:** Attackers can execute code on the server.

The remediation of this issue depends on the maintenance level of the affected SAS 9.4 software, as follows:

* SAS 9.4M6 (TS1M6): No action is required. The issue resolved in this release.
* SAS 9.4M5 (TS1M5): Apply the [SASÂ® Security Update for 9.4M5](https://support.sas.com/en/security-bulletins/sas-security-update-for-sas-for-sas-94m5-ts1m5.html).
* SAS 9.4M4 (TS1M4) and earlier: Follow the steps below. **Note:** Replace ***SAS-configuration-directory*** in the steps below with the complete path to your SAS configuration folder.
  1. Ensure that the SASÂ® software is updated with [SAS Security Update 2017-09.](http://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/hotfix/HF2/SAS_Security_Updates.html)
  2. Download the ZIP file that is on the **Downloads** tab and extract the serialization.conf file.
  3. Copy the serialization.conf file to ***SAS-configuration-directory*/Lev1/Web/WebAppServer/SASServer\_*Y*/conf/**.
  4. Add the following JVM argument to the start-up arguments for SASServer*X*\_*Y*:
     -Dhttpinvoker.deserialization.configfile=file:///*SAS-configuration-directory*/Lev1/Web/WebAppServer/SASServer*X*\_*Y*/conf/serialization.conf
  5. Repeat steps 1-3 for any additional SASServer*X*\_*Y* instances, if the environment is clustered.
  6. Restart all SAS 9.4 Web Application Server instances.
