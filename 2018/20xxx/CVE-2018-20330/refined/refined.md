Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer needed to load a BMP image. Specifically, the multiplication of `pitch` and `height` in `tjLoadImage` can result in an integer overflow, leading to a small buffer allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `pitch * (*height)` overflows, resulting in a smaller-than-required memory allocation.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The subsequent `memcpy` operation writes data past the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** According to the Ubuntu security notice, this issue could lead to arbitrary code execution. The github issue indicates a segmentation fault due to memory corruption, which could be leveraged for code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash due to a segmentation fault, described in the github issue, would cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious BMP Image:** An attacker can craft a specially crafted BMP image that triggers the integer overflow vulnerability in `tjLoadImage`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted BMP image to a system using a vulnerable version of libjpeg-turbo.
- No special privileges are mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The GitHub issue provides a specific example of how to reproduce the vulnerability using a `LAND3.BMP` file, demonstrating the integer overflow by printing the values of `pitch` and `height`, along with the result of their multiplication.
- The Ubuntu security notice specifies that this vulnerability affected Ubuntu 19.04.
