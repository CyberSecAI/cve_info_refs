This plugin wants you to connect to their site and pay for most features. It breaks the formatting when viewing your posts and products as well. Seems poorly made and a cash grab.

Update:
The last person I chatted with in Customer Service took great care of me and refunded me for the plugin. Thank you.
Original Message:
Lousy Support. I bought Schema Pro for $249 from their website. For the event schema, there were two issues. One was their timezone was set for the wrong time zone, even though it was set properly on my WP settings. They wouldn’t help out. And another issue that I proved with google documentation they were wrong about. I asked for a $249 refund, and the support never responded. This is a lousy model for customer support.

Podria ser un excelente plugin, pero como siempre tuvieron que cagar.la sale un feo cuadro en el footer izquierdo de la pagina, que por lo demas no obedece al diseño de la pagina lo que hace que quede feisimo.
lamentable considerando que la unica forma de ocultarlo es pagando por ello.

I tried this, documentation for things is shotty at best! When you look up online how to properly create a scheme with this plugin for a ‘person’ there is no good information. I tried it anyway, it added a huge box at the bottom of my page url, looked like complete sh… Sorry, being honest! Go elsewhere till this is cleaned up.
