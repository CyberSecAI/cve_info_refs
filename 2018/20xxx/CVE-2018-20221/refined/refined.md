Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20221

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The Deltek Ajera Timesheets application processes user-supplied data without proper validation, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes user-controlled data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the serialized data, permitting the execution of attacker-supplied code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The code runs with the privileges of the IIS Application Pool.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **Specific Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is `Secure/SAService.rem`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Ajera Timesheets application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL endpoint `Secure/SAService.rem`.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious .NET serialized object using tools like `ysoserial`.

**Technical Details:**
* The exploit uses a crafted payload that includes a compressed serialized .NET object. This payload is sent as an octet-stream to the vulnerable endpoint `Secure/SAService.rem`.
* The version of the Ajera server is included in the payload.
* The exploit script utilizes the `ysoserial` tool to generate the malicious serialized object.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Deltek Ajera Timesheets version 9.10.16 and earlier.
