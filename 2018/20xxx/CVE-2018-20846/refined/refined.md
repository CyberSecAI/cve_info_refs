Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit `c277159` which is related to CVE-2018-20846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an index out-of-bounds access vulnerability in the `pi->include[]` array within the `openmj2` library. The vulnerability exists in several functions (`pi_next_lrcp`, `pi_next_rlcp`, `pi_next_rpcl`, `pi_next_pcrl`, `pi_next_cprl`) within the `src/lib/openmj2/pi.c` file. The index was calculated using several variables `(pi->layno, pi->resno, pi->compno, pi->precno)` multiplied by step sizes, which could lead to an index exceeding the allocated size of the `pi->include` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Index Out-of-Bounds Access:** The code directly accesses `pi->include[index]` without ensuring that `index` is within the bounds of `pi->include_size`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** If the index goes out of bounds, it would lead to an attempt to read or write to an invalid memory location causing a crash and potentially a denial-of-service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, out-of-bounds access issues can sometimes be exploited for arbitrary code execution, especially if an attacker can control the out-of-bounds location and overwrite memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input Files:** A specially crafted MJ2 image file that leads to a large index when processed. The vulnerability would be triggered when the application parses this image file.
- **Control over parameters used in index calculation:** If the attacker has some control over the values of variables that are used in index calculation like (pi->layno, pi->resno, pi->compno, pi->precno).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious MJ2 image to be processed.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to cause the application to process the crafted input file.
- No specific user interaction is required other than having the target application process a malicious file.

**Fix:**
The fix implemented in this commit involves adding a check:
```c
if (index >= pi->include_size) {
  opj_pi_emit_error(pi, "Invalid access to pi->include");
  return OPJ_FALSE;
}
```
before accessing `pi->include[index]`. This check prevents out-of-bounds access by returning an error and preventing further processing if `index` is out of range.

**Additional Notes:**

- This commit is part of a larger pull request that addresses multiple vulnerabilities and bugs.
- The fix provides a basic safeguard against the index-out-of-bounds. It does not attempt to recover or gracefully handle the error and instead exits the current function.
- The code changes are made in multiple functions (`pi_next_lrcp`, `pi_next_rlcp`, `pi_next_rpcl`, `pi_next_pcrl`, `pi_next_cprl`).
