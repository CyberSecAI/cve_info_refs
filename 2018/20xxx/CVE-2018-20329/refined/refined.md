The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection in the `browseSessions` function within the `CoursesAndSessionsCatalog.class.php` file. The `$date` variable was not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized access to data, data modification, or other database-related attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `$date` parameter passed to the `browseSessions` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to call the `browseSessions` function with a crafted `$date` parameter containing malicious SQL code. The attacker must have access to a part of the application that calls this function with user-controlled data.

**Additional details:**
The provided commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerability by using the `Database::escape_string()` function to sanitize the `$date` parameter before it is included in the SQL query. It also casts the `$limit['start']` and `$limit['length']` to integers before they are used in the query.
