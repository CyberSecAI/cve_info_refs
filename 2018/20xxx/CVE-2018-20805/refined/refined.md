- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the MongoDB server handles `$or` pushdown optimization when `$not` is used within an `$elemMatch` query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A specially crafted query using `$elemMatch` with `$not` can lead to excessive iteration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering excessive iteration, leading to performance degradation or system unavailability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through database queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authorized to perform database queries.
