Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-20505 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is within the SQLite library, specifically related to how it handles certain SQL queries, potentially involving malformed or crafted queries, and primary keys with duplicate columns. The vulnerability stems from memory corruption issues due to improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Multiple memory corruption issues exist due to inadequate input validation within SQLite.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The SQLite library fails to properly validate and handle maliciously crafted SQL queries or inputs.
*  **Duplicate Columns in PRIMARY KEY:**  The vulnerability was triggered by a SQL query involving duplicate columns in a `PRIMARY KEY` definition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could also be exploited to cause a denial of service.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Some sources mention the potential for sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Data Modification/Addition:** Exploitation might allow an attacker to add or modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted SQL Queries:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Web Content:**  Maliciously crafted web content could trigger the vulnerability in applications using SQLite via WebKit.
*   **Malicious Applications:** Vulnerable applications that use SQLite could be targeted by malicious actors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute SQL Queries:** An attacker would need the ability to execute specially crafted SQL queries against a vulnerable SQLite database. This could happen through an application, service, or system that uses SQLite.
* **Ability to Process Malicious Web Content:** For exploitation through WebKit, the attacker would need to deliver malicious web content to the victim.
*   **Local Access (potentially):** While remote exploitation is possible, local access or execution capabilities within a vulnerable application may be sufficient for exploitation. The NetApp advisory indicates no specific network access requirement.

**Additional Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability is associated with versions of SQLite prior to 3.25.3.
*   The issue involves "row-value operations on a PRIMARY KEY that contains duplicate columns".
*   Specific SQL commands and syntax, like `CREATE TABLE t1(a,b,PRIMARY KEY(b,b)); SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (a,b) IN (VALUES(1,2));`, trigger the vulnerability (from the sqlite.org content)
*  Tencent Blade Team is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Multiple NetApp products (though many are listed as not affected).
*   iCloud for Windows, iTunes for Windows, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and iOS all have been listed as affected, indicating a wide scope of impacted applications
* Ubuntu Linux distributions were also affected.

**Remediation:**

*   Upgrade to SQLite version 3.25.3 or later.
*   NetApp and Apple addressed the vulnerability through updates to their affected products.
*   Ubuntu provided package updates to address the vulnerability.
