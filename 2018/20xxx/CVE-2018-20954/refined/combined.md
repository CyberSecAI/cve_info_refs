### @JackDca **[JackDca](/JackDca)** commented [Sep 24, 2018](#issue-363227285) • edited Loading

This PR adds screening of the existing keys that are considered to be listed in the Add Account-Create a new Account-Security and Privacy-Encryption pull down list, so that disabled, revoked and expired keys are excluded, fixing [#2142](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/2142).

* In mailpile.crypto.gpgi.GnuPGRecordParser.\_parse\_keydata() a boolean attribute "expired" is added and set to True IFF the "e" flag is present in the "validity" field.
* In mailpile.crypto.gpgi.GnuPG.list\_secret\_keys() the "expired" attribute is added to the attributes that are copied to the parsed output of the gpg --list-secret-keys command, from the parsed output of the gog --list-keys command. This coying is a workaround for a problem with gpg version < 2.1 in which the --list-secret-keys command does not display all the needed validity information. It is unnecessary for gpg version >= 2.1.18.
* In mailpile.plugins.crypto\_gnupg.GPGKeyListSecret, an option --usable is added to the crypto/gpg/keylist/secret command, which causes disabled, revoked and expired keys to be omitted from the command results.
* In shared-data/default-theme/html/profiles/account-form.html, the --usable option is added to the call to crypto/gpg/keylist/secret.

Note: The crypto/gpg/keylist/secret command SYNOPSIS formerly listed an argument "address" but that argument was not actually implemented. This may be because it is easier to implement the screening of the key User IDs for the correct email address in account-form.html than to pass the email address from the html interface back to the crypto/gpg/keylist/secret command.

This has been tested on the current Mailpile master, on Debian stretch, using gpg 2.1.18, with a set of test keys including disabled, revoked and expired keys.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff 1.0.0rc3...1.0.0rc4`
