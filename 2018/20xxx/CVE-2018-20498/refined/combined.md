# `refs` available to project `Guest`

Link: <https://hackerone.com/reports/404078>

Details:
Hi,

I have found an issue which can be used by an attacker guest user to see branches name and Tags name within project.

# POC:

* Create a project with branches and tag names.
* invite a guest user and now log from guest account
* now from guest account visit:
  <https://gitlab.com/cathaxx/private-caty/refs?search=> (<https://gitlab.com/username/projectname/refs?search=>)

It will show you all your branches(<https://gitlab.com/user/project-name/branches>) and tag name(<https://gitlab.com/user/project-name/tags>) in the project , which is normally forbidden.

Let me know if you need any more information or if i missed something.
Thanks

## Impact

Unintended data leakage to guest user.

## Notes from Security Team

~P3/~S3 since similar and more detailed informationÂ is available to guests when `Public Pipelines` are enables.
