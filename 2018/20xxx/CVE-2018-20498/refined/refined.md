- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in GitLab's access control implementation, where guest users are able to access the `/refs` endpoint. This endpoint is intended to list branches and tags, information that is normally restricted to users with higher access levels.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is insufficient access control enforcement on the `/refs` endpoint, allowing guest users to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with guest user privileges can obtain the names of branches and tags within a project, which is normally restricted. This constitutes an unintended data leakage.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is accessing the specific URL endpoint `/refs?search=` within the GitLab instance, while logged in as a guest user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to have guest user privileges in the target GitLab project.
