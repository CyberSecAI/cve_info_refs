The provided content describes a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in Craft CMS version 3.0.34.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject Twig template code within the Category Group creation interface, specifically in the "Category Group template" field. Craft CMS does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input before processing it as a Twig template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI): Attackers can inject malicious Twig code that is then executed by the server.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: Craft CMS fails to sanitize the user-provided template code, allowing arbitrary Twig code to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The provided example shows how an attacker can access and display sensitive information such as database credentials (`craft.app.config.DB.user` and `craft.app.config.DB.password`).
- Remote Code Execution (potential): While not explicitly shown in the example, SSTI vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to achieve remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control over the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Craft CMS category group creation function.
- Specifically, the "Category Group template" field within the category group creation form, that does not sanitize user-supplied input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges within Craft CMS in order to access the Category group creation functionality.
