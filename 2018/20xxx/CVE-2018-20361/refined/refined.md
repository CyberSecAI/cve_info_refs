Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20361:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `hf_assembly` function within the `sbr_hfadj.c` file of the FAAD2 library.
*   The issue is an invalid memory address dereference that causes a segmentation fault, identified by AddressSanitizer (ASAN). Specifically, the error occurs at line 1536 of `sbr_hfadj.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Invalid memory access/dereference**: The code attempts to access a memory location using an invalid or null pointer, leading to a crash. This suggests a potential logic error in how memory pointers are managed in `hf_assembly`, likely related to processing specific AAC file structures and data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the FAAD2 library/application when processing a specially crafted audio file. This leads to a denial-of-service as the application becomes unusable.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While the provided information primarily points to a DoS, the Debian Security Advisory mentions that these vulnerabilities *might* potentially allow arbitrary code execution. The memory corruption could potentially be leveraged for code injection.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted AAC files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specifically crafted MPEG AAC files.
*   **File Processing:** The attack vector involves feeding the vulnerable software (FAAD2) a specially crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious AAC file to an application using a vulnerable version of the FAAD2 library.
*   No specific privileged access to the system is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub issue report provides a crash log and a Proof of Concept (POC) file, demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The Debian security advisory lists CVE-2018-20361 along with other vulnerabilities in FAAD2, and clarifies that they can potentially lead to both denial of service and arbitrary code execution.
*   Gentoo Security Advisory also confirms that the vulnerabilities in FAAD2 can lead to arbitrary code execution, and that this particular issue can be exploited both locally and remotely.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of FAAD2 prior to 2.9.0.

In summary, CVE-2018-20361 in FAAD2 is due to an invalid memory address dereference in the `hf_assembly` function. This leads to a denial-of-service and could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution when processing a malicious AAC file.
