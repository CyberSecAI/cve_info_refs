| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1124781#c0)  Karol Babioch   2019-02-08 11:04:57 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-20340 YSA-2019-01  <https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2019-01/>  Yubico library libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 contains an unchecked buffer, which could allow a buffer overflow. Libu2f-host is a library that implements the host party of the U2F protocol. This issue can allow an attacker with a custom made malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer. Users of the YubiKey PAM U2F Tool are the most impacted since the arbitrary code could execute with elevated privileges.  It is not possible to perform this attack with genuine YubiKey devices and users utilizing a browser implementation of U2F are not affected by this issue.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

  ## **Security advisory YSA-2019-01 – unchecked buffer in libu2f-host**

  Published date: **2019-02-08**
  Tracking IDs: **YSA-2019-01**
  CVE: [CVE-2018-20340](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20340)

  ### Summary

  Yubico library libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 contains an unchecked buffer, which could allow a buffer overflow. Libu2f-host is a library that implements the host party of the U2F protocol. This issue can allow an attacker with a custom made malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer. Users of the YubiKey PAM U2F Tool are the most impacted since the arbitrary code could execute with elevated privileges.

  It is not possible to perform this attack with genuine YubiKey devices and users utilizing a browser implementation of U2F are not affected by this issue.

  ### User actions

  The affected library is included in a variety of applications. We recommend updating all affected software listed below.

  ### How to tell if you are affected – Yubico software

  | Affected Yubico software | Platform | Steps to mitigate |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | [YubiKey NEO Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager/) | WindowsLinuxMacOS | Use [YubiKey Manager](https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-manager/) in place of YubiKey NEO Manager |
  | [PAM U2F tool](https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/) | LinuxMacOS | Update the libu2f-host libraryDownload from the [Yubico Developer Program site](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/Releases/)Build according to the instructions on the [libu2f-host page](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) |

  ### How to tell if you’re affected – non-Yubico software

  Libu2f-host is an open source implementation of U2F that is made available for solution providers to incorporate for U2F in their products. Software that uses libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 could be affected by this issue. Yubico recommends that developers who use libu2f-host in their products update to the latest version of libu2f-host. [Libu2f-host](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) version 1.1.7 or above addresses the issue.

  In order to determine if a U2F application is using a vulnerable version of libu2f-host, users of U2F enabled software applications may execute the platform specific instructions below.

  Because these methods can have varying degrees of accuracy depending on the design of the application, Yubico encourages users to contact U2F application providers directly to find out if the application is impacted and, if so, whether an update is available.

  | Platform | Instructions |
  | --- | --- |
  | Linux | 1. To see if libu2f-host is installed in the library path use the ldconfig command:$ /sbin/ldconfig -p|grep libu2f-hostlibu2f-host.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so.0libu2f-host.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so1. To see if a certain application is linked with the library use ldd command:$ ldd your-u2f-application|grep libu2f-hostlibu2f-host.so.0 => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so.0 |
  | Windows | This requires use of [ListDLLs from Microsoft SysInternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/listdlls)1. Download and extract ListDLLs2. In a Command Prompt run and search for search for “libu2f-host”:$ listdlls.exe | findstr “libu2f-host” |
  | MacOS | 1. Use the otool command and search for “libu2f-host”$otool -L PathToApplication | grep “libu2f-host” |

  ### Downloads

  The latest release, 1.1.7, of libu2f-host can be found [here](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) under “releases”.

  ### Aggregate severity rating

  Yubico has rated this issue as Moderate based on maximum security impact. The base CVSS score is [6.3.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

  ### Acknowledgments

  On December 18, 2018, Christian Reitter notified Yubico of a security issue. We thank Christian Reitter for reporting this issue and working with us under coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could
enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could
use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device
masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library
is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a
genuine YubiKey.

### Bug Description

An external security researcher has found an issue on one of our open source libraries (libu2f-host) and we are planning on releasing a new version of the library and then also push the fix to github (<https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host>).

We have agreed on this being of Moderate severity with a CVSS score of 6.3. We have also acquired a CVE number for it (CVE-2018-20340, not yet public). Please note that the CVSS score of 6.3 could be considered too low. Depending on how you interpret it could also be 7.0 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>).

This bug is under embargo and the disclosure date & time are set for 8th of February, 12.00 CET, so we would be grateful if you could withhold any information or patches until then.

Below is text from our not yet published advisory. I have left out the parts that are not particular to Linux.

I have attached a patch that applies cleanly to 1.1.4 (Bionic) and 1.1.6 (Cosmic).

Please let us know if you any questions or require anything else from us.

Thanks,

Security Advisory 2019-02-08 - Unchecked Buffer in libu2f-host

==============================================================

Tracking IDs: YSA-2019-01, CVE-2018-20340

Summary

-------

Yubico library libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 contains an unchecked buffer, which could allow a buffer overflow. Libu2f-host is a library that implements the host party of the U2F protocol. This issue can allow an attacker with a custom made malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer. Users of the YubiKey PAM U2F Tool are the most impacted since the arbitrary code could execute with elevated privileges. It is not possible to perform this attack with genuine YubiKey devices and users utilizing a browser implementation of U2F are not affected by this issue.

User Actions

------------

The affected library is included in a variety of applications. We recommend updating all affected software listed below.

Affected Yubico Software:

o YubiKey NEO Manager

  Use YubiKey Manager in place of YubiKey NEO Manager.

o PAM U2F tool

  Update the libu2f-host library that libpam-u2f depends on.

How to Tell if You’re Affected - Non-Yubico Software

----------------------------------------------------

Libu2f-host is an open source implementation of U2F that is made available for solution providers to incorporate for U2F in their products. Software that uses libu2f-host prior to version 1.1.7 could be affected by this issue. Yubico recommends that developers who use libu2f-host in their products update to the latest version of libu2f-host. Libu2f-host version 1.1.7 or above addresses the issue.

In order to determine if a U2F application is using a vulnerable version of libu2f-host, users of U2F enabled software applications may execute the platform specific instructions below.

Because these methods can have varying degrees of accuracy depending on the design of the application, Yubico encourages users to contact U2F application providers directly to find out if the application is impacted, and if so, whether an update is available.

To see if libu2f-host is installed in the library path use the ldconfig command:

$ /sbin/ldconfig -p|grep libu2f-host

        libu2f-host.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so.0

        libu2f-host.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so

To see if a certain application is linked with the library use ldd command:

$ ldd your-u2f-application|grep libu2f-host

        libu2f-host.so.0 => /usr/local/lib/libu2f-host.so.0

Downloads

---------

The latest release, 1.1.7, of libu2f-host can be found here under “releases”: <https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/>

Aggregate Severity Rating

-------------------------

Yubico has rated this issue as Moderate based on maximum security impact. The base CVSS score is 6.3(<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>).

Acknowledgments

---------------

On December 18, 2018, Christian Reitter notified Yubico of a security issue. We thank Christian Reitter for reporting this issue and working with us under coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

Hi Manbeer,

Thanks for the report and patch.

Just an FYI, we try to avoid issuing security updates on Fridays (and thus try to avoid CRDs that occur on such days), to reduce the amount of work sysadmins might need to do over weekends.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for following back up. I agree and see your point on not doing Friday releases. We will incorporate that into our process and moving forward on avoiding Monday and Friday releases.

Package        : libu2f-host
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20340
Debian Bug     : 921725

Christian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing
the host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a
buffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made
malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical
access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host
integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libu2f-host packages.

# Yubico libu2f-host vulnerability - part one

Nov 29, 2019
â¢
Christian Reitter
ID:
CVE-2018-20340

Related articles:
[Yubico YubiHSM PKCS#11 Library Vulnerability (CVE-2023-39908)](/posts/yubico-yubihsm-pkcs-vuln/)
â¢ [Yubico libykpiv Vulnerabilities II](/posts/yubico-libykpiv-vuln2/)
â¢ [Yubico yubihsm-shell Vulnerability (CVE-2021-43399)](/posts/yubico-yubihsm-shell-vuln3/)

As part of the background research on the [U2F HID handshake](/posts/u2fhid_init_resp-information-leak/) information leak, I discovered through manual code analysis that the Yubico [libu2f-host](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) host-side C library contained an **out of bounds write vulnerability** which could be triggered by a malicious U2F client device.

Since the libu2f-host library is the basis for [PAM over U2F](https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/) login functionality that can be added to Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, BSD and macOS, this issue had the potential to affect a number of specially protected systems. MITRE assigned **CVE-2018-20340** for this issue.

*Note: [part two](/posts/yubico-libu2f-host-vuln-part2/) describes CVE-2019-9578, a closely related second vulnerability.*

## The vulnerability

As described in depth in the [U2F HID issue](/posts/u2fhid_init_resp-information-leak/) article, the U2F HID communication with an U2F client device is always initiated by the host side. The U2F client - usually a physical token connected via USB - then responds with a specific reply message to the initial request and the main U2F communication including the cryptographic challenges can be done over the arranged channel id.

The vulnerability is present due to faulty handling of the first reply message in the libu2f-host library.

The U2F handshake is initiated via the `U2FHID_INIT` message in the `init_device` function:

```
unsigned char resp[1024];
// [...]
size_t resplen = sizeof (resp);
dev->cid = CID_BROADCAST;

if (u2fh_sendrecv
    (devs, dev->id, U2FHID_INIT, nonce, sizeof (nonce), resp,
     &resplen) == U2FH_OK)
  {
    // note: client response is handled here
```

[devs.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/375cfc47705febcb2b56d1e9da7cf253c7a050f2/u2f-host/devs.c#L237)
The actual communication happens in the `u2fh_sendrecv` function which is built to **generically** handle the send- and receive logic. Note that `u2fh_sendrecv` conveniently collects and returns the relevant bytes of the reply message(s) to the calling function. *The generic nature of this utility function is part of the general problem, as I will show later.*

In the beginning of `init_device`, the response buffer `resp` with the size 1024 bytes is allocated and `resplen` is set to value `1024`, as shown in the previous code snippet.

`resplen` is then handed to `u2fh_sendrecv` where it is used under the `recvlen` name as an upper limit on the number of U2F âpayloadâ bytes that may be accepted during the receive stage:

```
unsigned int maxlen = *recvlen;
```

[u2fmisc.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/4d490bb2c528c351e32837fcdaebd998eb5d3f27/u2f-host/u2fmisc.c#L219)

However, `resplen` is also used as a return parameter to specify how many U2F message payload bytes were actually written to the `resp` buffer:

```
*recvlen = datalen;
```

[u2fmisc.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/4d490bb2c528c351e32837fcdaebd998eb5d3f27/u2f-host/u2fmisc.c#L322)
Since `u2fh_sendrecv` is a generic send/receive function, it is not designed to limit the type and length of the received message.

For the relevant U2F client response, the [U2F specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.2-ps-20170411/fido-u2f-hid-protocol-v1.2-ps-20170411.html#u2fhid_init) defines a particular response message with a fixed number of **17 bytes** of U2F payload. This data is normally contained in a single HID response packet.

The FIDO U2F standard mandates compatibility with larger responses:

> An U2FHID host shall accept a response size that is longer than the anticipated size to allow for future extensions of the protocol, yet maintaining backwards compatibility.

However, `u2fh_sendrecv` imposes no meaningful checks at all and happily assembles multi-packet messages (*via so-called continuation packets*) which allows attackers to provide up to **1024 bytes** of U2F payload data instead of the regular **17 bytes** while still returning `U2FH_OK` and continuing in the program flow.

The actual vulnerability is triggered in `init_device` once the `resp` buffer of **attacker-controlled size** and with **attacker-controlled contents** is **memcpy**âed to the `initresp` struct that is at most **20 bytes** in size, which leads to the out of bounds write:

```
if (u2fh_sendrecv
    (devs, dev->id, U2FHID_INIT, nonce, sizeof (nonce), resp,
     &resplen) == U2FH_OK)
  {
    U2FHID_INIT_RESP initresp;
    memcpy (&initresp, resp, resplen);
    dev->cid = initresp.cid;
    dev->versionInterface = initresp.versionInterface;
    dev->versionMajor = initresp.versionMajor;
    dev->versionMinor = initresp.versionMinor;
    dev->capFlags = initresp.capFlags;
  }
```

[devs.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/375cfc47705febcb2b56d1e9da7cf253c7a050f2/u2f-host/devs.c#L245-L256)

Up to 1004 bytes of attacker-controlled data are written to the stack.

### Attack scenario and security implications

The attack applies to host systems which use of libu2f-host through

* an authentication module like **pam\_u2f.so** (*privileged execution*)
* other userspace applications that depend on libu2f-host such as **yubikey-manager**
* the **command-line tool** bundled with libu2f-host

Once the library initiates a handshake with an U2F token, e.g. during an authentication attempt, the token can trigger the buffer overflow on the stack and potentially execute code with the relevant privileges or potentially skip the login authentication. Any malicious USB device which enumerates as a recognized U2F token class can perform this attack.

#### CVSS score

Yubico has assessed this with a [CVSSv3 score of 6.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) via *AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H*.

In my opinion, the CVSS **Scope (S)** metric should be **Changed** if the attack allows to move past authentication barriers and therefore past the vulnerable component, but I find their overall classification reasonable.

#### Relation to other attacks

This vulnerability shares a number of similarities with the [CVE-2018-14779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14779) buffer overflow in [Yubico host-side code related to smart cards](https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2018-03/) which was discovered mid-2018 by Eric Sesterhenn of [X41 D-Sec](https://www.x41-dsec.de/). Ericâs talk *âIn Soviet Russia Smart Card Hacks Youâ* at 35C3 describes both the general [patterns](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9346-in_soviet_russia_smart_card_hacks_you#t=241) which are relevant for this attack vector as well as the [specific impact](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9346-in_soviet_russia_smart_card_hacks_you#t=1126) that buffer overflows in privileged authentication code can have.

I find it plausible that drivers and low-level code for local, âsafeâ systems such as smartcards have less thoroughly analyzed or hardened interfaces since the involved developers are mainly focused on other development aspects or different attack scenarios. This is clearly an interesting area for further research.

#### Mitigations

I was surprised to find that the libu2f-host build system did not enable `-fstack-protector-all` or other protections such as `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` when compiled from source:

| RELRO | STACK CANARY | NX | PIE | RPATH | RUNPATH | Symbols | FORTIFY | Fortified | Fortifiable | FILE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Partial RELRO | **No canary found** | NX enabled | PIE enabled | No RPATH | No RUNPATH | 136 Symbols | No | 0 | 8 | u2f-host |

Particularly the missing stack canary is a **serious problem** in the context of this vulnerability as it reliably detects the attack and limits the impact to denial of service.

During discussion with Yubico, it turned out that most of the hardening flags are usually provided by the build environment.
This meant that most binary packages were in fact shipped **with mitigations in place** by major distributions like Debian, Ubuntu and others since their build environment includes the hardening flags:

| RELRO | STACK CANARY | NX | PIE | RPATH | RUNPATH | Symbols | FORTIFY | Fortified | Fortifiable | FILE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full RELRO | **Canary found** | NX enabled | PIE enabled | No RPATH | No RUNPATH | No Symbols | Yes | 2 | 4 | u2f-host |

However, it is possible that the library is used productively in other places and systems without these mitigations, e.g. as a self-compiled binary or as a code dependency.
In my opinion, these hardening flags should be included and active by default.

#### Fingerprinting

During research, I found that the host library always uses the **identical ânonceâ** when initiating contact with the U2F client:

/* FIXME: use something slightly more random as nonce */

[devs.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/375cfc47705febcb2b56d1e9da7cf253c7a050f2/u2f-host/devs.c#L241)

For the malicious client, this provides a simple and accurate way to detect that libu2f-host is used on the host side.
Through this detection, a malicious U2F token can behave functionally correct when used against unaffected host-side U2F code (*e.g. browsers*) and only trigger the exploit once used with the vulnerable library.

### POC

Iâve built a simple âmaliciousâ U2F token on the basis of the Trezor One. The device detects the characteristic nonce value of the library (*see above*) and âattacksâ with one packet full of `AAAAA` to demonstrate the issue.
For hardened libu2f-host binaries with stack canary, this leads to a crash, as expected:

```
echo "dummy" | u2f-host -aauthenticate -o https://demo.yubico.com -d
USB send:
00ffffffff8600080807060504030201000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
USB recv:

*** buffer overflow detected ***: u2f-host terminated
```
## Responsible disclosure

I responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Yubico in December 2018 and received quick and competent feedback during the holiday season.
They applied for [CVE-2018-20340](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20340) and originally asked me for 90 days of disclosure embargo but managed to ship the release after about ~52 days.

A number of Linux distributions were given early warning to prepare security releases.

Overall, I am fairly satisfied with the disclosure process.
