{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A timing side channel during ECC key generation, specifically due to an unblinded Montgomery ladder.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The use of an unblinded Montgomery ladder in ECC key generation resulted in a timing side channel.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker capable of timing the key generation process could potentially recover bits of the secret key, making brute-force attacks more efficient.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local or cross-VM cache analysis attack by an attacker that can measure the time of ECC key generation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to perform timing analysis of the ECC key generation process, likely requiring local access or ability to perform cross-VM attacks to analyze cache behavior."
