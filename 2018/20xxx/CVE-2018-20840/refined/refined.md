Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `google-api-cpp-client` incorrectly handled the `exp` (expiration time) field in ID tokens received from the Google OAuth Server. The `exp` field is an integer representing the expiration time, but the client library was attempting to treat it as a string, causing a type conversion error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Data Type Handling:** The client library was using `data.GetString("exp", &str_value)` to retrieve the `exp` value, which expected a string, while the server was providing an integer. This mismatch caused a `std::runtime_error` due to a type conversion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Crash:** The immediate impact was a `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'` leading to the application crashing when attempting to use ID tokens with "profile" or "email" scopes. This effectively rendered the authentication process unusable in these cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable in the sense of an attacker triggering it. It is triggered by legitimate client application usage trying to acquire ID tokens with specific scopes. However, an attacker might be able to exploit this indirectly by disrupting the functionality of applications relying on this library for authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker doesn't need any specific position or capabilities to exploit the issue, as the issue arises from how the library processes the ID token. The library's incorrect assumption about the type of 'exp' field is what causes the problem.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involved changing the data retrieval method from `data.GetString("exp", &str_value)` to `data.GetScalar("exp", &int_value)`, ensuring the `exp` field was parsed as an integer.
