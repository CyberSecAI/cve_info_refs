# Error on 'exp' type handling in ID Token  #57

[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy link[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy linkClosedClosed[Error on 'exp' type handling in ID Token](#top) #57Copy link[![@sungjungk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17704390?v=4&size=80)](/sungjungk)
## Description

[![@sungjungk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17704390?v=4&size=48)](/sungjungk)[sungjungk](https://github.com/sungjungk)opened [on Aug 10, 2018](https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57#issue-349340458)

Problem:

The following errors occurred during the attempt to request ID Token with specifying ‘profile’ or ‘email’ in SCOPES parameter.

```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Type is not convertible to string

```

Cause:

When receiving ID Token from Google OAuth Server, ‘exp’ in the token is representing the type of integer. Unfortunately, 'google-api-cpp-client' deals with it as a string type; it causes the above problem. For your information, I attached the format of ID Token received from the server.

```
{
  "azp": "...”,
  "aud": "...",
  "sub": "...",
  "email": "...@gmail.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "at_hash": "...",
  "exp": 1533783763,
  "iss": "accounts.google.com",
  "iat": 1533780163
}

```

It is a measure for issue [#57](https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57).

Modification:

Change the way of ‘exp’ handling; from data.GetString(“exp”, &str\_value) to data.GetScalar(“exp”, &int\_value)

Result:

It will not happen the bug when receiving ID token value.

Sorry, something went wrong.
