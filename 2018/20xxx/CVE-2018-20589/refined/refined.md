Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Administrator/add_pictures.php` and `Administrator/users.php` files. Specifically, the code was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to the absence of output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is XSS. This occurs when an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In this case, it was possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by manipulating input fields in the vulnerable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Stealing:**  Attackers could steal the administrator's session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the CMS.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  Attackers could potentially access or manipulate data within the CMS, possibly including sensitive information.
*   **Phishing/Redirection Attacks:** Attackers could redirect the administrator to malicious sites or perform phishing attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could trick the admin into revealing information of other websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through user input fields within the `Administrator/add_pictures.php` and `Administrator/users.php` pages. An attacker could inject malicious scripts into these input fields which were not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to input data into the vulnerable fields in the administrator pages. This would typically require the attacker to have some level of access to the CMS application, such as being a lower-level user who is allowed to enter information that the administrator then reviews, or for the attacker to somehow persuade an administrator to enter malicious data.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by using `htmlspecialchars` function. This function ensures that special characters are properly encoded before being rendered in the HTML output, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific files involved, the method of exploitation, and the impact.
*   The pull request clearly states the nature of the fix: using `htmlspecialchars` to prevent XSS.
*   The attacker indicated that a Proof of Concept (PoC) could be provided.
*   The fix was applied on January 3, 2020.
*   The original issue was reported by user @manasmbellani.
