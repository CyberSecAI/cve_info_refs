Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20011

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization within the DomainMOD application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `CatagoryName`, `StakeHolder`, `ssl-provider-name`, `ssl-provider's-url` and `username` fields before displaying it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the vulnerable fields and stored in the application's database. When a user views the page containing the injected data, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information (e.g., session cookies), perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the application's interface.
- **Account Compromise:** If an administrator's account is targeted, it could lead to a complete compromise of the application and its data.
- **Widespread Impact:** Because the XSS is stored, it can impact all users who have permission to view the vulnerable page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the application's web interface. Specifically, by submitting the payload to the add category, add SSL provider and add SSL provider account pages.
- **Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attack exploits the `CatagoryName`, `StakeHolder`, `ssl-provider-name`, `ssl-provider's-url` and `username` input fields on the `/assets/add/category.php`, `/assets/add/ssl-provider.php` and `/assets/add/ssl-provider-account.php` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the DomainMOD application.
- **Access to Vulnerable Pages:** The attacker needs to have access to the pages `/assets/add/category.php`, `/assets/add/ssl-provider.php` and `/assets/add/ssl-provider-account.php`.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit code uses a common XSS payload: `"><img src=x onerror=alert("Xss-By-Abdul-Raheem")>`. This injects an `<img>` tag with an invalid `src` attribute, which triggers the `onerror` event, executing the embedded JavaScript.
- Vulnerable versions are v4.09.03 to v4.11.01.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was reported on GitHub.
- The application is open source, written in PHP and uses MySQL.
- The vulnerability is classified as stored XSS, meaning the malicious code is stored persistently on the server.
