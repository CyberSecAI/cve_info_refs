- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "User Photo" field when creating or editing a user, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/validation
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "User Photo" field that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the user information page. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit user accounts via the application's user management interface. The malicious payload is stored in the database and is triggered when a user accesses a page where the "User Photo" is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the privileges to manage user accounts within the application (e.g., admin or user manager role). They need to input a specific payload during user creation/edit.
