Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20166

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file upload functionality of Rukovoditel PM/CRM version 2.3.1. The application does not perform proper extension checking on uploaded files. It only verifies the "GIF89a;" header to bypass the initial check and allows the file upload. However, an `.htaccess` rule blocks the execution of many file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Upload:** The application inadequately validates the extension of uploaded files, relying only on a "gif" file header.
- **Case-Insensitive Extension Check:** The application's file extension check is case-insensitive allowing extensions like `.pHp`, `.Php`, or `.PhP` to bypass filters.
- **Missing .htaccess Restriction Bypass:** The server has .htaccess restriction that blocks execution of .php, .html, .cgi, .pl, and .exe files; however, due to case-insensitivity, attackers can upload with `.pHp` and execute the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a specially crafted PHP file (with a .pHp extension and prepended "GIF89a;" header), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Meterpreter Session:** The exploit allows the attacker to establish a Meterpreter session, gaining further control of the compromised server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker leverages the file upload feature meant for background images.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to log into the Rukovoditel PM/CRM application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs awareness of the file upload vulnerability and the bypass techniques.
