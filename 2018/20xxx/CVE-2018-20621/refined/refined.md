Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insecure file permissions set on the `MemuService.exe` service binary during the installation of the MEmu Android Emulator. These weak permissions allow any user to modify the `MemuService.exe` executable file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is that the `MemuService.exe` binary has overly permissive access control lists (ACLs). Specifically, "Everyone" has write permissions which include `WriteOwner, Delete, WriteAttributes, Synchronize`.
- **Binary Planting:** The vulnerability can be exploited by replacing the legitimate `MemuService.exe` with a malicious executable file. When the service starts or restarts, the attacker's code will be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM level privileges. This means complete control over the affected machine.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can perform any action on the system, including installing malware, accessing sensitive data, or creating new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** An attacker must have local access to the target machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Binary Replacement:**  The attacker replaces the original `MemuService.exe` with their malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the Windows machine where MEmu emulator is installed. This account does not need to have administrator rights, as the vulnerable service runs as SYSTEM.
- **File System Access:**  The attacker requires write access to the directory where `MemuService.exe` resides, typically `C:\Program Files\Microvirt\MEmu\`.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**
- The content includes a PoC that details the steps for exploitation:
  1. Rename the original `MemuService.exe` to `MemuService.exe.old`.
  2. Use PowerShell Empire's PowerUp module `Install-ServiceBinary` to create a service entry pointing to the attacker's malicious `MemuService.exe` binary.
  3. Reboot the system to execute the malicious binary as SYSTEM.
- The output of `Install-ServiceBinary` command confirms the weak permissions on the executable `C:\Program Files\Microvirt\MEmu\MemuService.exe`. It also confirms that the service runs under the LocalSystem account.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects MEmu emulator version 6.0.6.
