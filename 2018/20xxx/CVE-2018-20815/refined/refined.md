Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `load_device_tree()` function within QEMU. This function is responsible for loading device tree blobs during boot time. The vulnerability arises from improper device tree size manipulation before buffer allocation, leading to a signed integer overflow that can be exploited to cause a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:**  A critical vulnerability where data is written beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing unpredictable behavior.
*   **Signed Integer Overflow:**  A flaw where the manipulation of the device tree size results in a signed integer exceeding its maximum limit, wrapping around to a small negative or positive number, potentially causing a small buffer to be allocated, leading to buffer overflow later.
*   **Lack of Proper Size Validation:**  The code fails to validate the manipulated device tree size correctly before allocating memory for it, leading to a buffer of inadequate size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow could also result in a crash of the QEMU process, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Though not explicit, memory corruption flaws like heap overflows may also leak data through read side effects of the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Device Tree Blob:** An attacker could craft a malicious device tree blob that triggers the integer overflow, causing the allocation of an insufficient buffer size. The attacker could then cause the QEMU process to load the malicious device tree.
*   **Virtual Machine Configuration:** By controlling the configuration of a virtual machine, an attacker could potentially influence the device tree loading process to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Influence VM Boot Process:** The attacker must have the capability to influence the device tree loading process of a virtual machine running on QEMU.
*   **Ability to Supply Malicious Input:** The attacker would need the ability to provide or modify a device tree blob during the VM startup process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat products (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenStack, Red Hat Virtualization) and also Debian and Fedora.
*   Patches for this vulnerability have been implemented in various QEMU versions.
*   Red Hat's advisories recommend that users upgrade to the patched versions and restart all running virtual machines for the fixes to take effect.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Kurtis Miller of NCC Group.
