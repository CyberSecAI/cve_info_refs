Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `opj_get_encoding_parameters` function within the OpenJPEG library.
- The issue is due to an improper computation of tile boundary values (`*p_tx0`, `*p_tx1`, `*p_ty0`, `*p_ty1`).
- Specifically, the code was using potentially overflowing integer arithmetic and then casting to a signed integer type. This could cause incorrect boundary calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the potential for integer overflow when calculating tile coordinates. This can happen when the intermediate values `l_tx0` and `l_ty0` become very large and wrap around, leading to incorrect calculations.
-   **Incorrect Tile Boundaries:** Because of the integer overflow, the calculated tile boundaries can become incorrect. These values are later used in memory access, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Incorrect tile boundary calculations could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing the application to crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
-   **Undefined Behavior:** Integer overflows result in undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Maliciously Crafted JPEG 2000 Images:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially designed JPEG 2000 image that would trigger the integer overflow in the `opj_get_encoding_parameters` function, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when the image is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted JPEG 2000 image to an application that uses the vulnerable OpenJPEG library. This would typically involve either:
    -   Persuading a user to open the malicious image.
    -   Exploiting a different vulnerability to deliver the malicious image to a system that processes it automatically.

**Additional Details:**

- The commit `c58df149900df862806d0e892859b41115875845` addresses this vulnerability by changing how `*p_tx0`, `*p_tx1`, `*p_ty0`, and `*p_ty1` are computed. It uses `opj_uint_max` and `opj_uint_min` to ensure that the boundary calculations are correct and prevent integer overflows.
- The fix for CVE-2015-1239 only partially fixed this issue.
-  The issue was also present in `opj_tcd_init_tile`, and fixed by commit `5d00b719f4b93b1445e6fb4c766b9a9883c57949`
