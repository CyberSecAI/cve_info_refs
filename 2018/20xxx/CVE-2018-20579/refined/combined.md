## Description

[![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)](/cve-reporting)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Jul 11, 2018](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/601#issue-340228143)

Function `push()` that implements stack push operation does not check whether new elements are still within allocated buffer.

It returns error only before ending the function, but this value is never checked in JSON parser, so the next push operations are not blocked.

`contiki-ng/os/lib/json/jsonparse.h:41`:

```
	#define JSONPARSE_MAX_DEPTH 10
```

Declaration of the buffer: `contiki-ng/os/lib/json/jsonparse.h:44-55`

```
	struct jsonparse_state {
	...
		char stack[JSONPARSE_MAX_DEPTH];
	};
```

Function `push()`: `contiki-ng/os/lib/json/jsonparse.c:37-44`

```
	static int
	push(struct jsonparse_state *state, char c)
	{
	  state->stack[state->depth] = c;
	  state->depth++;
	  state->vtype = 0;
	  return state->depth < JSONPARSE_MAX_DEPTH;
	}
```

Sample usage of `push()`: `contiki-ng/os/lib/json/jsonparse.c:114`

```
	int
	jsonparse_next(struct jsonparse_state *state)
	{
	  char c;
	  char s;
	  char v;

	  skip_ws(state);
	  c = state->json[state->pos];
	  s = jsonparse_get_type(state);
	  v = state->vtype;
	  state->pos++;

	  switch(c) {
	  case '{':
	    if((s == 0 && v == 0) || s == '[' || s == ':') {
	      push(state, c);
```

Vulnerability is not likely to be used for Remote Code Execution exploit, because it allows to only put two types of characters to this stack: left curly bracket (`{`), left square bracket (`[`), so the risk was reduced (Confidentiality: None, Integrity: Low, Scope: Unchanged).

However it is quite easy to overwrite the function return address on stack or stack canary, which leads to crash of the application (via segmentation fault) and can be used by attacker for Denial of Service attacks.

Additionally, the risk of this issue is also reduced (Attack Vector:Local) because attacker would need to parse malicious JSON, however it is quite possible when using JSON input data in IoT application.

Proposed CVSS score:

```
CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H (6.8 - Medium)

```

Following JSON will trigger crash:

```
	{"a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": { "a": {

```

or using square brackets:

```
	{"a": [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[

```

Mitigation :

Function `push()` should not allow to add new elements to the stack after reaching the limit (`JSONPARSE_MAX_DEPTH`).

Functions using the `push()` function should check the returned value.

Crash details using Address Sanitizer:
