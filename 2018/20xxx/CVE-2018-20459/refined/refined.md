Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20459:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow (out-of-bounds read) in the `armass_assemble` function of radare2, specifically in the `libr/asm/arch/arm/armass.c` file at line 6549.
- The issue arises due to an incorrect indexing in a loop where the index `j` could reach the length of the input string `str` leading to a read out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow (OOB read):** The code reads memory beyond the allocated buffer when parsing ARM assembly instructions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the `rasm2` tool due to the heap-buffer-overflow. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information only demonstrates a crash, heap-based overflows can potentially be exploited for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted string as input to the `rasm2` assembler. This could be an arbitrary string containing a `#` character.
- **File Input:** The vulnerable function can be triggered by using the `-f` flag in `rasm2` with a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `rasm2` tool. This could be through a command-line argument or by providing a malicious input file.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was triggered during fuzzing.
- The provided crash log points directly to the line where the out-of-bounds read occurs.
- A fix for the issue was implemented in commit `e5c14c1` which was specifically created to fix issues #12417 and #12418.
- The fix changed the looping condition from `str[i]` to `str[j]`.
