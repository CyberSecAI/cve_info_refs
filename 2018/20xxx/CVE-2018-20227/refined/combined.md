## Description

[![@QiAnXinCodeSafe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39950310?u=8c4ad8c2174ba78c0604614a6e2feced07521ce6&v=4&size=48)](/QiAnXinCodeSafe)[QiAnXinCodeSafe](https://github.com/QiAnXinCodeSafe)opened [on Dec 18, 2018](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/1210#issue-392033361)

Hi all,

There is a path traversal vulnerability found by Qihoo360 CodeSafe Team.

Details as bellow:

[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39950310/50139352-690c8680-02dc-11e9-9612-56394c620268.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39950310/50139352-690c8680-02dc-11e9-9612-56394c620268.png)

When decompressing zip files, entries are not checked, resulting in overwriting arbitrary files by traversing directories using “.. /”
