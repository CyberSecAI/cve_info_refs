…lspecialchars variable to ensure that XSS is prevented by replacing any possible bad chars

Dear Repository maintainer,

Hope you are going well and had a Merry Christmas.

Administrator/add\_pictures.php,Administrator/users.php(fix): used htmlspecialchars variable to ensure that XSS is prevented by replacing any possible bad chars

Without applying this temporary fix, it is possible to trick admins of the CMS to be tricked into executing arbitrary javascript code and have their cookies stolen OR tricked into revealing info of other websites through tools such as BEEF Hook. PoC can be provided if required.

I would like to release the PoC exploit after 2 weeks (14 days) - could you please let me know on manasmbellani@gmail.com if you have any queries, concerns or issues with the requested fix. I would recommend pulling this branch version and updating to the latest as soon as possible.

I will also be requesting a CVE number via CVE Mitre for this bug.

Wish you a very Happy New Year!

Thanks and Kind Regards,

Manas Bellani
