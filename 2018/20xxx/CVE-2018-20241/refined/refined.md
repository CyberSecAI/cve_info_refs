The content is related to CVE-2018-20241.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `wbuser` parameter when handling the "edit upload" resource for a review.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser, which can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Theft of sensitive user information
  - Other malicious activities performed in the context of the victim's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `wbuser` parameter when editing an upload for a review.
- A remote attacker can send a crafted link to a user of the affected application. If the user clicks the link, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user of the application to click the crafted link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability if a user with an active session clicks the crafted link.

**Affected versions:**
- Atlassian Crucible and FishEye versions before 4.7.0.
- Specifically, version 4.6.1 is mentioned as affected.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.7.0 of Atlassian Crucible and FishEye.
