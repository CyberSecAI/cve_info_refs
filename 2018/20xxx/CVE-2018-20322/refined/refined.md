The provided content relates to CVE-2018-20322.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames during the upload of survey resources and themes. Specifically, the application failed to properly encode filenames containing malicious code, allowing it to be executed when displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, caused by the lack of proper encoding of filenames, allowing malicious JavaScript code embedded in filenames to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session. This could lead to stealing of sensitive information like admin cookies (CSRF tokens), potentially leading to account takeover or other malicious actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the upload functionality for survey resources and themes.
- An attacker uploads a specially crafted zip file containing a malicious filename (e.g., `<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>.php`).
- The system displays the malicious filename without proper sanitization, leading to execution of the embedded JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload survey resources or themes. This typically requires admin privileges or a role that allows such uploads.
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted zip file containing malicious filenames and a corresponding XML file to facilitate the upload.
