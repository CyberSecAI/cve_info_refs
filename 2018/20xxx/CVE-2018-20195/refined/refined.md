Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `ic_predict` function within the `libfaad/ic_predict.c` file of the FAAD2 library. Specifically, the issue occurs at line 96 of the mentioned file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can cause a crash in the application when processing a crafted audio file, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not directly stated in all sources, the Debian Security Advisory mentions a possibility of arbitrary code execution, suggesting that under certain circumstances the vulnerability could be leveraged beyond a simple crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted MPEG AAC Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted MPEG AAC audio files.
- **Remote Attack:** As the crafted files can be delivered remotely, the vulnerability can be triggered remotely, provided the software is processing the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable software with a specially crafted MPEG AAC file. This could be done through a variety of methods (e.g. user opening a file, an application processing a file downloaded via network etc.)
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue was reported with a crash report from AddressSanitizer (ASAN) indicating a segmentation fault (SEGV) at the vulnerable line of code.
- The issue is fixed in FAAD2 version 2.9.0 and later.
- Gentoo and Debian released security advisories to address this vulnerability along with other related vulnerabilities in FAAD2.
