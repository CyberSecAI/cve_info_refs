- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the `strlenext` function within `decompile.c` because the function doesn't check if the input `str` is NULL before attempting to dereference it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference in the `strlenext` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault, which results in a crash of the `swftopython` program.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted SWF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed SWF file that, when processed by `swftopython`, causes the `strlenext` function to be called with a NULL pointer.
