## The way we work has changed. It’s time data protection changed too

Let’s face it. Data protection is a mandate, but not often a successful initiative. The research is clear: employee-driven data loss is frequent, impactful, costly, and uncontrolled – even when organizations have multiple solutions in place today. Learn why Incydr is a more effective and efficient way to solve for data loss.

![feature_images_Data_sharing_code42.jpg](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/700f8dc18dae44aab933f45a5dbcc9f7?v=7cf32cc5)

### Employees are taking data

60% of employees in midsized businesses admit to moving work files to their personal accounts.

### Data loss is costly

The average cost of a single insider threat incident is $15M. (Code42 DER 2024)

### Insider risk events persist

Insider-driven data events are increasing, despite 99% of companies using traditional DLP solutions.

## Secure critical data without the traditional perimeter

![eliminate_blindspots.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/0bfed2aeb57040a19a311e9967fe70c8?v=88349642)
### Eliminateblind spots

Detect data theft and IP leaks immediately with unmatched visibility – no complex policies needed.

![automate_response.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/f667440f64ce4c03b5855e09b677421d?v=23c63ff1)
### Automateeffective response

Automatically correct mistakes, block unacceptable activity, and document and contain insider threats.

![productivity.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/af40e9e8bfae480ba76eb2453bc5194b?v=6319bf75)
### Never disruptproductivity

Deploy Incydr confidently, knowing it won't affect device performance or restrict legitimate file activity.

## Incydr at a glance

![W_risk_prioritization.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/3416d5ff633f46e09ad57deb0d3aec11?v=636fe83c)
### Effective risk prioritization

Eliminate blind spots and focus on the threats that matter with Incydr's intelligent PRISM system to prioritize both your known and unknown data risks.

![Incydr-prioritization.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/31c475906d2b4f5a885fb3801cc76177?v=b6760b73)

### Comprehensive coverage

One solution to see and stop data leak and theft across endpoints, browsers, and cloud – protecting your source code, customer data, and most valuable Intellectual property.

![Incydr-coverage.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/b7787cba083344e5a7950bdb22183251?v=dac6d1cf)

![W_response_controls.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/64a58613b456489ebfa0461760faba9d?v=ba5e9615)
### Native response controls

Correct, block, contain, and investigate. With Incydr, you’ll respond appropriately to every type of event – from mistake to threat.

![Incydr-controls.png](https://assets.mimecast.com/api/public/content/73c6f267c04442f1bef7740bc083bc62?v=44ca93d1)

### 30+ integrations

Incydr's integrations allow you to maximize the value of your existing tech stack across SIEM, SOAR, XDR, IAM, HCM, and more.

## The Incydr difference

### ROI in less than 6 months

Unlike policy-driven solutions which take months to deploy and fine-tune, half of Incydr customers spend less than 4 hours a week – and have no dedicated headcount.

### Better coverage, better results

Rather than stitch DLP, CASB, and UEBA together for the coverage and context you need, Incydr delivers better detection in a single solution. It detects more and prioritizes better – helping companies reduce time to investigate high-risk incidents by 50%.

​

## Incydr plays well with your existing tech stack

90% of companies use a combination of DLP, CASB, or UEBA to stop data exfiltration.

Consolidate your tech with Incydr and integrate seamlessly with your remaining solutions.
