Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-20196:

**Root Cause:**

*   Stack buffer overflow in the `calculate_gain` function located in `libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c`.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow that occurs when writing to a local variable named `S_M` within the `calculate_gain` function. The size of the data written exceeds the allocated buffer size on the stack, causing a memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The overflow can lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The debian security advisory also mentions that it "might allow remote attackers to cause denial of service or any unspecified impact via crafted MPEG AAC data." This suggests that, theoretically, other impacts beyond denial of service may be possible but are not clearly defined.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MPEG AAC data:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file, indicating the vulnerability is triggered through malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing malicious AAC data to an application using the affected faad2 library.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted AAC data to the vulnerable system, which could be through a web server, email attachment, or other means.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github issue shows an AddressSanitizer (ASAN) report that pinpointed the overflow at line 1287 of `sbr_hfadj.c` within the `calculate_gain` function.
*   The ASAN report further specifies the overflow occurs when writing 4 bytes past the allocated memory of `S_M`, at a stack offset of 740.
*   The provided github issue also includes a link to a Proof of Concept (POC) file.
*   The Debian security advisory (DLA 1899-1) and Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202006-17) confirm the vulnerability exists in `faad2` and provide details about the fix.
