Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the FrogCMS 0.9.5 page editing functionality. Specifically, the "body" field of a page being edited is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the body field when editing a page. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where FrogCMS is hosted. This can lead to:
    - Full compromise of the server
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Denial of service
    - Further attacks on other systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible via the web interface of FrogCMS, specifically when editing a page.
- **Page Editing:** The attacker needs to be able to access the page editing functionality of the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to edit pages within the FrogCMS admin panel.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the command injection vulnerability in the body field and be able to craft appropriate payloads to execute commands.

**Steps for Exploitation (as described in the content):**
1.  Log in to the FrogCMS admin panel.
2.  Navigate to the page editing interface (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/FrogCMS/admin/?/page/edit/1`).
3.  Insert the command injection payload within the "body" field of the page.
4.  Save and close the page.
5.  Visit the page (e.g., `127.0.0.1/FrogCMS/index.php`) and the injected command will execute.
