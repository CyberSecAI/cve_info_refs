The provided content relates to CVE-2018-20594.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `FlowableModelManagerController.java` file, where the `export` method accepts `modelId` and `type` parameters from the URI without proper validation. Specifically, when the `modelId` is not found, the program directly outputs the `type` parameter onto the page, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with an invalid `modelId` and a payload within the `type` parameter, and tricking a user into clicking this malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and have a user click on that URL.
