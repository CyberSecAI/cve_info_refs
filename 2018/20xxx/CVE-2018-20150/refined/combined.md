# WordPress plugs bug that led to Google indexing some user passwords

WordPress 5.0.1 also fixes seven security vulnerabilities.

A week after releasing its first major update in quite some time, the WordPress team has pushed the first security patch for its brand new [WordPress 5.0 branch](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/wordpress-5-0-is-out-heres-a-tour-of-the-new-features/).

Released hours ago, WordPress version 5.0.1 fixes seven security vulnerabilities (some of which allow site takeover) but also plugs a pretty serious privacy leak.

**Also: [A botnet of over 20,000 WordPress sites is attacking other WordPress sites](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-botnet-of-over-20000-wordpress-sites-is-attacking-other-wordpress-sites/)**

The latter was found by the authors of the popular Yoast SEO plugin, who discovered that in some cases the activation screen for new users could end up being indexed by Google.

With specially crafted Google searches, an attacker could find these pages and collect users' email addresses, and in some rare cases, default-generated passwords.

This leak could have catastrophic consequences if the user has an admin role or if the user didn't change his default password, as is regularly advised.

On top of this, WordPress 5.0.1 also adds support for a stronger MIME validation process for uploaded files.

"Prior to 5.0.1, WordPress did not require uploaded files to pass MIME type verification, so files could be uploaded even if the contents didn't match the file extension. For example, a binary file could be uploaded with a .jpg extension," said Ian Dunn, a WordPress CMS developer.

"This is no longer the case, and the content of uploaded files must now match their extension. Most valid files should be unaffected, but there may be cases when a file needs to be renamed to its correct extension (e.g., an OpenOffice doc going from .pptx to .ppxs)," Dunn said.

The WordPress team improved its MIME validation process after two security researchers, Tim Coen and Slavco, discovered that authors on Apache-hosted sites could upload specifically crafted files that bypass MIME verification, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

On top of this, Coen also discovered that WordPress users could edit new comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and that specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances. In this latter case, the WordPress CMS itself was not affected, but Coen said WordPress plugins could be impacted in some scenarios.

But the biggest of the seven security flaws reported to the WordPress team and fixed in v5.0.1 is an issue found by Sam Thomas from Secarma Labs, about which ZDNet wrote this past August --more details [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/wordpress-vulnerability-affects-a-third-of-most-popular-websites-online/)-- and which can lead to full site takeovers.

On top of this, the WordPress team also fixed two bugs reported by RIPS Technologies. One bug could allow authors to alter meta data to delete files that they weren't authorized to, and the second allowed authors to create unauthorized posts.

Today's fixes have also been ported to the older 4.x branch, users of which received version 4.9.9 to address the reported problems.

Debian Bug     : 916403

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) and PHP injections attacks, delete files, leak
potentially sensitive data, create posts of unauthorized types, or
cause denial-of-service by application crash.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

                 CVE-2018-20153
Debian Bug     : 916403

CVE-2018-20147

    Authors could modify metadata to bypass intended restrictions on
    deleting files.

CVE-2018-20148
    Contributors could conduct PHP object injection attacks via crafted
    metadata in a wp.getMediaItem XMLRPC call. This is caused by
    mishandling of serialized data at phar:// URLs in the
    wp_get_attachment_thumb_file function in wp-includes/post.php.

CVE-2018-20149

    When the Apache HTTP Server is used, authors could upload crafted
    files that bypass intended MIME type restrictions, leading to XSS,
    as demonstrated by a .jpg file without JPEG data.

CVE-2018-20150

    Crafted URLs could trigger XSS for certain use cases involving
    plugins.

CVE-2018-20151

    The user-activation page could be read by a search engine's web
    crawler if an unusual configuration were chosen. The search engine
    could then index and display a user's e-mail address and (rarely)
    the password that was generated by default.

CVE-2018-20152

    Authors could bypass intended restrictions on post types via crafted
    input.

CVE-2018-20153

    Contributors could modify new comments made by users with greater
    privileges, possibly causing XSS.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.25+dfsg-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

This commit introduces the `wp_kses_uri_attributes` function and filter. The function centralizes the list of attributes, in order to prevent inconsistency, and the filter provides a way for plugins to customize the attributes.

# WordPress 5.0.1 Security Release

---

WordPress 5.0.1 is now available. This is a **security release** for all versions since WordPress 3.7. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

Plugin authors are encouraged to [read the 5.0.1 developer notes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/13/backwards-compatibility-breaks-in-5-0-1/) for information on backwards-compatibility.

WordPress versions 5.0 and earlier are affected by the following bugs, which are fixed in version 5.0.1. Updated versions of WordPress 4.9 and older releases are also available, for users who have not yet updated to 5.0.

* [Karim El Ouerghemmi](https://ripstech.com) discovered that authors could alter meta data to delete files that they weren’t authorized to.
* Simon Scannell of [RIPS Technologies](https://blog.ripstech.com) discovered that authors could create posts of unauthorized post types with specially crafted input.
* [Sam Thomas](https://twitter.com/_s_n_t) discovered that contributors could craft meta data in a way that resulted in PHP object injection.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) discovered that contributors could edit new comments from higher-privileged users, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) also discovered that specially crafted URL inputs could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in some circumstances. WordPress itself was not affected, but plugins could be in some situations.
* [Team Yoast](https://yoast.com/) discovered that the user activation screen could be indexed by search engines in some uncommon configurations, leading to exposure of email addresses, and in some rare cases, default generated passwords.
* [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu) and [Slavco](https://medium.com/websec) discovered that authors on Apache-hosted sites could upload specifically crafted files that bypass MIME verification, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Thank you to all of the reporters for [privately disclosing the vulnerabilities](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/), which gave us time to fix them before WordPress sites could be attacked.

[Download WordPress 5.0.1](https://wordpress.org/download/), or venture over to `Dashboard → Updates` and click `Update Now`. Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update automatically.

In addition to the security researchers mentioned above, thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 5.0.1:
