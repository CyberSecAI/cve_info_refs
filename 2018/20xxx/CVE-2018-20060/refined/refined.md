The provided documents contain information about CVE-2018-20060. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is that urllib3, before version 1.23, does not remove the `Authorization` HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The primary vulnerability is the failure to remove the `Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects, which can lead to unintended exposure of credentials.
- The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP redirects, specifically when the redirect leads to a different origin (different host, port, or scheme) than the original request.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker could potentially intercept the `Authorization` header, exposing the credentials it contains, if a server redirects to a different origin.
- **Data disclosure:** If the Authorization header contains sensitive information, that information could be disclosed to an unauthorized party.
- **Possible data manipulation/modification:** In the NetApp context, it's mentioned that successful exploitation could also lead to addition or modification of data, though the details of how this would happen are not elaborated upon.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In the NetApp context, it is stated that successful exploitation could also lead to denial of service, though the specific attack vector for this is not explained in detail.

**Attack vectors:**

- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks are a primary attack vector. An attacker who can intercept traffic between the client and the server can potentially read the `Authorization` header during a cross-origin redirect.
- The vulnerability can be triggered even when the redirect is cross-origin, meaning the redirection can go to another server as well.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the victim and the server, typically through a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to visit the server to trigger the vulnerable behavior.
- The targeted server has to redirect the client to a different origin while using HTTP authorization

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during cross-origin redirects, which occur when the redirect target's host, port, or scheme differs from the original request.
- Patched versions of `python-urllib3` remove the `Authorization` header by default on redirects.
- Mitigation for this vulnerability can be done by manually handling redirects.
