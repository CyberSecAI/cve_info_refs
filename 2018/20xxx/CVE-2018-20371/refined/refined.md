- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure authentication method in the login mechanism and password request communication of the iOS mobile web-application. Specifically, the password request is a simple, less protected attempt to the `login.html` file with `\_` to split between the password and file. There are also no request limitations to block automated brute-force attacks. Additionally, the web-server communication does not use HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure authentication: The login mechanism is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to the lack of request limitations and a weak password request method.
    - Lack of HTTPS: The web server communication uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing communication to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    - Insecure storage of sensitive information: Although not explicitly mentioned, the overall context points to this.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to the private vault and the data stored within.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote attack via network access to the web-server over wifi, with no user interaction required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device running the vulnerable application, with network access to the web-server. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
    - No user interaction is required.
    - No privileged user account is needed.
