{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the SSLContext and boolean values of CertificatePinner.java through hooking, allowing an attacker to bypass certificate pinning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The CertificatePinner class in OkHttp is vulnerable to manipulation via hooking techniques.",
       "Lack of sufficient protection against runtime modification of security-critical parameters."
    ],
    "impact": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attackers can bypass certificate pinning, potentially intercepting and manipulating network traffic, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "Application hooking."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to hook or modify the application's runtime environment.",
      "Network position to intercept traffic."
    ]
