Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple input fields in the DomainMOD application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the input before rendering it in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application is vulnerable to stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected via input fields and stored in the application's database. This injected script is then executed when other users access the page, leading to malicious actions within the context of those users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information like cookies or session tokens.
- **Account Hijacking:** XSS can be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers might use XSS to deface the website by injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript that changes the content.
- **Malware Distribution:** XSS could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or deliver malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting XSS payloads into the following input fields:
    - `/assets/add/ssl-provider.php` : `ssl-provider-name` and `ssl-provider's-url` fields
    - `/assets/add/ssl-provider-account.php`: `username` field
    - `/assets/add/category.php`: `CatagoryName` and `StakeHolder` fields
- The attacker injects the malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert("Xssed-By-Abdul-Raheem")>`) into the vulnerable input fields.
- When a user accesses a page where these stored values are displayed, the injected JavaScript code executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable pages ( `/assets/add/ssl-provider.php`, `/assets/add/ssl-provider-account.php`, and `/assets/add/category.php` ). This implies the attacker would need a valid user account.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable input fields on the specified pages.
- **Ability to Inject Script:** The attacker needs to be able to enter and submit the malicious XSS payload into the vulnerable fields.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects DomainMOD versions from v4.09.03 to v4.11.01.
- The proof of concept (POC) is available at: [https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod/issues/88](https://github.com/domainmod/domainmod/issues/88)
