Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20749:

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-20749 is a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability found in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` of the LibVNCServer library. It's related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-15127. This vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2018-15127). The original fix failed to completely address the heap out-of-bounds write issue within `rfbserver.c`. Specifically, it occurs in the handling of `rfbServerCutText` messages where the length of the text being sent was not correctly validated before allocating a buffer, potentially causing an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds write. The server does not properly validate the length of data received in `rfbServerCutText` messages before allocating memory, leading to potential out-of-bounds write during the copy operation
- Incomplete fix. The patch for CVE-2018-15127 was insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Remote code execution: By overwriting critical data structures on the heap.
- Denial of service: Through crashing the application via memory corruption.
- Information disclosure: By overwriting pointers or other data, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious VNC server sending crafted `rfbServerCutText` messages to a vulnerable client could trigger this vulnerability.
- The attack is performed over the network connection used by the VNC protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate a VNC server that connects to a vulnerable LibVNCServer client (or control the server part of the connection).
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable client; the vulnerability is triggered by the VNC server sending malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when handling `rfbServerCutText` messages which are part of the RFB protocol (VNC).
- Patches should implement proper checks and bounds before allocating memory. The patch involves ensuring length validation, and safe memory allocation to avoid overflow
- The fix was described as adding casts to (uint64_t) before adding 1 in `malloc()` calls but this was later found to be insufficient especially on 32-bit systems.
- A related issue is that the fixes for these vulnerabilities did not introduce safety limits prior to the `malloc()` calls to prevent maliciously large memory allocations on the client by a rogue server.
