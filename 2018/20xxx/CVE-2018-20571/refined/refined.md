- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user input in the `id` parameter of the `Tpl/Add` action, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability, arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files (e.g., `config.ini.php`) which can contain database credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing directory traversal sequences in the `id` parameter of the `Tpl/Add` action. Specifically `s=Tpl/Add/id/.\Public\Config\config.ini.php` allows reading the configuration file. The backslashes are URL encoded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is explicitly stated as being necessary.
