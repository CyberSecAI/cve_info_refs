The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2018-20673.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in `libiberty` library within `cplus-dem.c` at line 2246. The integer overflow occurs when the variable `r` is greater than `0x40000000`. This overflow leads to an undersized memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The multiplication of `sizeof(char*) * r` overflows when `r` is a large value, resulting in a small value.
- Heap overflow: When the undersized memory allocated is accessed in the loop at line 2249, it causes a heap buffer overflow due to writing outside of the allocated memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided crash output confirms a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted input using the `nm` command with the `-C` option, as demonstrated in the provided proof of concept (POC) file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the `nm` tool such that the value of variable `r` within the vulnerable code path exceeds the overflow threshold, and triggers the vulnerability.
