Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-20584:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The provided text indicates that multiple issues were found in the JasPer JPEG-2000 library, including CVE-2018-20584. However, it does not specify the exact root cause of CVE-2018-20584.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   The vulnerability is present within the JasPer library, a software-based implementation of the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard.
-   Specifically, the identified vulnerability is related to how the JasPer library handles certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files, which could lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the application processing a malformed JPEG-2000 image.
-  The Debian security advisory mentions potential memory leaks and potentially arbitrary code execution, but this is not specifically tied to CVE-2018-20584 in the provided text.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves processing a malformed JPEG-2000 image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file to an application that uses the vulnerable JasPer library for processing images.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Gentoo security advisory suggests that JasPer is no longer maintained upstream and has multiple unaddressed vulnerabilities.
- The Gentoo advisory recommends users to unmerge/uninstall the package.
- The github issue #192 indicates a hang in jasper while converting output format to jp2, this was reported against version <=2.0.14.
- The Debian security advisory mentions multiple CVEs fixed in the update including CVE-2018-20584 and indicates that processing a malformed image file could lead to application crash, memory leaks and potentially arbitrary code execution.
