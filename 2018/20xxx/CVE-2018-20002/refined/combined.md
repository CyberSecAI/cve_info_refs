# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201908-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.32-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.32-r1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition or have other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.32-r1"

```
