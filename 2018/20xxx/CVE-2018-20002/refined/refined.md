Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-20002:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory leak exists in the `_bfd_generic_read_minisymbols` function within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, a component of GNU Binutils.
- Specifically, a heap allocation for `syms` is made using `bfd_malloc`, but this memory is not deallocated under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unfreed memory allocation leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted file.
-  Tools such as `nm` can be used to reproduce the bug by processing the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted file to be processed by a vulnerable binutils tool such as `nm`.
- User interaction is required because the user needs to run a vulnerable tool to parse a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in GNU Binutils 2.31 and fixed in later versions.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) involves using the `nm` utility with a malicious file, which triggers the memory leak when the  `_bfd_generic_read_minisymbols` function allocates memory without freeing it on certain code paths.
- NetApp products that incorporate GNU Binutils libraries, such as ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere, are also affected.
- Ubuntu also had a similar vulnerability, and provided updates.
- Gentoo also recognized the vulnerability.
