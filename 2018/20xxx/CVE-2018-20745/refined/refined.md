Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability related to CORS, as described in the first document and referenced in the second document:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the overly permissive nature of CORS configurations and the complex interactions between the CORS protocol and web application implementations. Specifically, when a CORS policy is configured to allow any origin (`*`), some web frameworks, including the Yii2 framework (as described in the second document), actively convert this to reflect back any `Origin` header value from the request. This behavior is dangerous because it effectively trusts any website and allows it to read authenticated resources, circumventing the browser's same-origin policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Overly Permissive Header Formats and Values:**  Browsers do not sufficiently restrict the format and values of CORS whitelisted headers, allowing attackers to craft malicious payloads within these headers.  Specifically, the `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, and `Content-Language` headers, while having RFC defined formats are not enforced by browsers, leading to potential injection issues.  Although the `Content-Type` header is restricted to three specific values, this restriction can be bypassed.
2.  **Lack of Header Size Limitations:** Browsers generally allow much larger header sizes than web servers, which can be leveraged for side-channel attacks (e.g., inferring cookie presence and size).
3.  **Overly Flexible Body Format and Values:** The lack of restrictions on the format and values of request bodies in CORS "simple requests" enables attackers to craft binary data in any format, leading to new security issues like file upload CSRF and attacks on binary-protocol services.
4.  **Risky Trust Dependencies:**
    *   HTTPS sites trusting their own HTTP domain: An attacker can hijack an HTTP domain, and then send a cross-origin request to the corresponding HTTPS domain, circumventing HTTPS protection.
    *   Trusting other domains: An attacker can compromise a weaker trusted domain and issue CORS requests to obtain sensitive information from a strongly secured target site. This includes subdomains, which, when compromised, can be used to access other trusted subdomains.
5.  **Poor Expressiveness of Access Control Policies:** CORS policies are not expressive enough for common web development patterns, leading to error-prone dynamic policy generation.
6.  **Forgeable "null" Origin Values:** The `null` Origin value can be forged, allowing attackers to bypass security restrictions.
7.  **Complexity of Security Mechanisms:**  The interaction between `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is not well-understood, and some frameworks actively convert this combination into reflecting the origin, bypassing security mechanisms.
8.  **Complex Interactions with Caching:**  The interaction between CORS and HTTP caching, where the absence of the `Vary: Origin` header can cause cached resources to be served with incorrect CORS policies, leading to potential access issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in internal services by crafting malicious payloads in request headers.
*   **Privacy Information Leakage:** Attackers can remotely infer a victim's cookie presence and size on any website, potentially revealing private information.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers can exploit file upload CSRF vulnerabilities, bypassing previous defenses.
*   **Attacking Binary-Protocol Services:** Attackers can exploit binary-protocol services within internal networks by crafting malicious request bodies.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Active network attackers can read sensitive information and launch CSRF attacks against HTTPS websites by hijacking trusted HTTP domains.
*   **Information Theft and Account Hijacking:** Attackers can steal secrets and/or hijack accounts on strongly secured target sites by exploiting vulnerabilities on weaker websites.
*   **Cache Poisoning:**  Resources can be cached with incorrect CORS policies, making them inaccessible to authorized domains.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Attacks:** By tricking a victim into clicking a link or visiting a malicious website, attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser and send crafted cross-origin requests.
*   **Network Attacks:** Active network attackers can manipulate network traffic to hijack HTTP domains and redirect cross-origin requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Attackers:**
    *   Ability to host and control a malicious website.
    *   Ability to entice a victim to visit the malicious website or click a malicious link.
    *   Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTTP.
*   **Active Network Attackers:**
    *   Ability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the victim's network.
    *   Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
    *   Ability to hijack HTTP traffic.

In summary, the provided content describes a series of vulnerabilities in CORS implementations that can be exploited by attackers to bypass the browser's Same Origin Policy and compromise web applications and their users. The primary issue revolves around the over-permissive nature of some CORS configurations and the flawed handling of the wildcard (`*`) by certain web frameworks.

The second document confirms the existence of this vulnerability in the Yii2 framework, as it is noted that "When CORS policy is configured to \*, current Yii2 CORS filter will actively convert it to reflect any Origin header value."
