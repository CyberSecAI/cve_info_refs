  Configurations

## Installation

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don not need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of JS Jobs, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type JS Jobs and click Search Plugins. Once you have found our job board plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now.

#### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our job board plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

#### Updating

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

#### Minimum Requirements

* WordPress 3.5 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

I struggled with this plugin for several days and encountered many errors. I finally deleted it. It needs improvement, and I’m scared to imagine how the pro version will perform. I do not recommend it.

I had a terrible experience with the Wordpress plugin from joomsky The plugin is unreliable, and I experienced numerous issues, including slow support, non-functioning messaging, payment problems, and fatal errors. The support team was unhelpful and even offensive at times. I wouldn’t recommend this plugin to anyone and suggest avoiding JoomSky altogether. Find something at envato with higher start rating.

Many thanks for bringing this awesome plugin to us;
it just gives me much much more than i expected. Awesome!
It is a truely great plugin – feasible for many purposes. It works great right out of the box, but is very easy to customize to suit your needs.
JS-Jobs for its great design and the lightweight plugin that enables you to add job board functionality to the website. i love the modern UI – and all the options to submit jobs to the job board – besides the methods to manage jobs from the jobs dashboard.
JS-Jobs – is great when it comes to configuration: my current use-case: I’m using this plugin to manage a small job-site: You can do so much with this plugin.
Amazing job: i love this plugin! To sume up: Many thanks for bringing this awesome plugin to us; 10 stars (out of 5 possible) from me!

The product has some great features and is a great solution for people looking to create a job board. We ran into a few kinks with the Plug-in. The Developer was responsive and ultimately assisted us in getting everything fixed. However, the communication process was a bit lengthier that we would have liked an this delayed our launch by a few weeks. The developer kept sending instructions that did not make any sense without clarification. But we are happy now that everything is working!
