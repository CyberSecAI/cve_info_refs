Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- The `title` parameter in the `Admin/Menu/Ajax` endpoint is vulnerable to XSS because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application takes user input from the `title` parameter and reflects it back in the HTML output without sufficient sanitization.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Although an attempt was made to prevent code injections, it was not sufficient and can be bypassed. The fix replaces certain characters but doesn't fully sanitize HTML special characters like < or > that are required for XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `title` parameter.
- When a user with administrative privileges visits a crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will execute in their browser.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Defacement of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `title` GET parameter.
- The vulnerable URL is specifically: `http://{domain}/{Typesetter}/index.php/Admin/Menu/Ajax?cmd=AddHidden&redir=redir&title=x%20onmouseover%3dalert(0)%20x%3d&gpreq=json&jsoncallback=jQuery111303231258407947004_1524609082471&gpx_content=gpabox&_=1524609082474`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The victim needs to be a logged-in user with administrative privileges who visits the crafted URL or a similar malicious link that includes the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description.
- It includes:
    - The specific vulnerable parameter (`title`)
    - The exact vulnerable URL with an example exploit
    - The attack pattern (`x+onmouseover=netsparker(0x006C67)+x=`)
    - The code change to mitigate the XSS vulnerability. It replaces certain characters, not HTML encoding, which is inadequate.
    - The original and the fixed lines of code.
    - The vulnerability was discovered by Mithat Gogebakan using the Invicti Web Application Security Scanner.
    - The vulnerability was fixed by the vendor, Typesetter.
