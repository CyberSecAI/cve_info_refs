  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference in the `Sass::Eval::operator()(Sass::Supports_Operator*)` function within the `eval.cpp` file of LibSass.",

      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted sass input file triggers the vulnerability during processing."
