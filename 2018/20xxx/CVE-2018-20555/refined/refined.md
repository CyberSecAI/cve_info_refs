{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Social Network Tabs WordPress plugin exposes sensitive Twitter API keys (access_token, access_token_secret, consumer_key, consumer_secret) within the HTML source code of pages where the Twitter widget is displayed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information",
      "Insecure Storage of Credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take over Twitter accounts by using the exposed API keys. This allows them to perform actions such as liking tweets, retweeting, changing profile information, and more on behalf of the compromised accounts. The impact could include reputational damage, spam campaigns, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerable data is exposed in the client-side HTML. A malicious actor can perform a request to the target website and read the twitter api keys directly in the source code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the source code of a web page that is using the vulnerable plugin. This can be achieved through any web browser or by directly requesting the page using tools like curl or wget. No advanced capabilities or specific location requirements are necessary."
