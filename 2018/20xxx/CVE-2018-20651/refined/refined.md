CVE-2018-20651:

- Root cause of vulnerability: A NULL pointer dereference in the elf_link_add_object_symbols function within elflink.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. This issue occurs when processing a crafted ET_DYN (dynamic executable) file lacking program headers.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash.

- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a specially crafted ELF file.

- Attack vectors: A specially crafted ELF file is processed by tools that rely on the vulnerable BFD library, such as ld (linker).

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted ELF file, typically through user interaction or a vulnerable application that processes untrusted ELF files.

CVE-2018-6543:

- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the load_specific_debug_section function in objdump.c. This overflow leads to a `malloc()` call with 0 size, potentially leading to a crash or further memory corruption.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Integer overflow when handling section sizes, resulting in a zero-sized `malloc()`. This can cause a crash or have other unspecified impact.

- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a crafted ELF file. There's also a possibility of unspecified other impact.

- Attack vectors: A crafted ELF file is processed by tools that rely on the vulnerable BFD library.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a crafted ELF file.

CVE-2018-20623:

- Root cause of vulnerability: Use-after-free vulnerability in the error function in elfcomm.c. This occurs when processing a crafted ELF file via the process_archive function in readelf.c.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Use-after-free condition leading to a crash.

- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash).

- Attack vectors: A specially crafted ELF file is processed by tools that rely on the vulnerable BFD library such as readelf.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted ELF file, often through user interaction or a vulnerable application.

CVE-2018-19932:

- Root cause of vulnerability: An integer overflow and infinite loop caused by the IS_CONTAINED_BY_LMA macro in elf.c within the BFD library.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Integer overflow leading to an infinite loop, causing a denial of service.

- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by processing a crafted binary file.

- Attack vectors: A crafted file can trigger the vulnerability when processed.

- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted file.
