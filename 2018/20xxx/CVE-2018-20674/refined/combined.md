DIR-850L Rev. Ax/Bx, DIR-880L Rev.Ax, DIR-822 Rev. Cx :: Authenticated Command Bypass & Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE)

**Overview**

On November 1, 2018 a security researcher from CyCarrier CSIRT contacted D-Link regarding two security issues that affect the DIR-850L Hardware Rev. Ax/Bx, DIR-880L Hardware Rev.Ax, DIR-822/DIR-822-US Hardware Rev. Cx.  To identify the hardware revision, please inspect the devices label on bottom of device.

We coordinated with the security researcher from CyCarrier CSIRT, patched and release new firmware for each of the  affected models below.

**3rd Party researcher**

Henry Huang from CyCarrier CSIRT

**Description of Security Issue:**

* Authentication bypass
* Authenticated RCE

This attack does require an authenticated user to the web-GUI configuration of the device.  The web-GUI configuration interface is only available on the LAN-side of the device.

WAN-side access to the web-GUI configuration is default disabled, and D-Link does not ever recommend enabling this feature.
