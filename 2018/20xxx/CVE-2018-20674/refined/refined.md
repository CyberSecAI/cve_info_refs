Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated, but the advisory mentions "Authenticated Command Bypass" and "Authenticated RCE," indicating that the web-GUI has vulnerabilities that allows an attacker, after authentication, to bypass normal command restrictions and execute arbitrary commands on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows for a bypass of intended command execution restrictions within the web-GUI.
- **Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An authenticated user is able to execute arbitrary commands on the device via the web-GUI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full control of the affected devices by executing commands. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
  - Data theft
  - Malware installation
  - Denial-of-service attacks
  - Network manipulation

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web-GUI configuration interface of the device.
- The vulnerability requires an attacker to be an authenticated user to the web-GUI.
- The web-GUI interface is accessible on the LAN side by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the LAN side of the network
- The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the web-GUI configuration interface of the device.

**Additional Details:**
- D-Link was contacted by a third party security researcher on November 1, 2018 regarding the vulnerabilities.
- Patched firmware versions have been released for the affected models.
- D-Link recommends that all users install relevant updates.
- The advisory explicitly notes that WAN-side access to the web-GUI is disabled by default, and strongly advises against enabling it.
- The advisory also mentions that the hardware revision information can be found on the product label or on the device web configuration.
