- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from using `open-uri` when importing projects with LFS objects. `open-uri` follows redirects without consulting `Gitlab::UrlBlocker`, which is responsible for enforcing SSRF policies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The application makes uncontrolled HTTP requests to arbitrary targets based on user-provided data (project imports).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exfiltrate data from the local network by directing the application to make HTTP requests to internal services or resources not intended to be exposed.
- **Attack vectors:** Importing a project that utilizes LFS, where the LFS object location is controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create a project and make it available for import, including LFS objects.  The attacker is an existing user of the GitLab instance being targeted.
