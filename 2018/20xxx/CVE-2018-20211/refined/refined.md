      "The application attempts to load a DLL (ws32_32.dll) from a predictable location within the user's %TEMP% directory without proper validation. Specifically, it looks in `%TEMP%\\par-%username%\\cache-exiftool-8.32`"

        "Local file system manipulation. An attacker creates a malicious DLL with a specific name (ws32_32.dll) in a specific directory. When the victim executes the vulnerable application, it loads the attacker-controlled DLL instead of the legitimate one."
