Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20458.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `r_bin_dyldcache_extract` function within the `libr/bin/format/mach0/dyldcache.c` file. This occurs when processing a truncated dyldcache file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing a malformed or truncated dyldcache file. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs when accessing `image_infos[idx].address` due to insufficient bounds checking on the calculated `liboff`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the `rabin2` tool, as reported by the AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for other issues: While a crash is the immediate consequence, heap-based buffer overflows can, in certain cases, be exploited further to achieve more severe outcomes such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious/corrupted dyldcache file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted or truncated dyldcache file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malformed or truncated dyldcache file to the `rabin2` tool to trigger the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker can influence the input file of the tool.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided commit `30f4c7b` addresses this vulnerability.
- The issue was reported with an AddressSanitizer output indicating a heap-buffer-overflow at `libr/bin/format/mach0/dyldcache.c:64`.
- The issue was reproducible using `rabin2 -E c01` with a provided test file.
