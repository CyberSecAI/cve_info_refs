Hello,

Hongxu Chen reported a stack-overflow in regexec.
I suspect it is the same as the one reported here:
  <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2018-09/msg00066.html>

But just in case, the full report is below.

regards,
 - assaf

Hi,

    Latest sed (4.7.4-f8503-dirty; and prior to this, e.g. 4.4) may trigger
a stack overflow error by executing the following command.

    echo 0 | ./sed '/\(\)\(\1\(\)\1\(\)\)*/c0'    # equivalently sed -f
c01.sed c01.in

    ASan reports like this:
AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL

Hello,

Hongxu Chen reported a stack-overflow in regexec.
I suspect it is the same as the one reported here:
  <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2018-09/msg00066.html>

But just in case, the full report is below.

regards,
 - assaf
