Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `regexec.c` file of the GNU C Library (glibc). Specifically, a stack overflow can occur in the `check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1` function, triggered by a specially crafted regular expression. The issue appears to stem from unbounded recursion within the regular expression matching logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack overflow due to excessive recursion. This occurs when processing a regular expression with a large number of nested groups and repetitions.
*   **Unbounded Recursion:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of regex pattern that leads to deep recursion, indicating a lack of proper handling of complex regular expression patterns within the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack causes a stack overflow, leading to the termination of the program and thus creating a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Regular Expression:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted regular expression to an application that uses the vulnerable `regexec` function in `glibc`.
*   **Input to vulnerable applications:** An attacker must be able to control or influence regular expression parameters within a vulnerable application.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to influence regex input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious regular expression to a vulnerable application. This can be done through various means, depending on the application's input mechanism.
*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any special privileges or elevated access.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of `glibc` are affected.
*   The vulnerability is present in `glibc` versions up to 2.29.
*   NetApp has provided patches for several affected products.
* The issue is triggered by the following type of regular expression: `/\(\)\(\1\(\)\1\(\)\)*/`

**CVE Specifics**

The provided information aligns with the details that would be expected from a CVE regarding a stack overflow in `glibc`'s regex functionality, though it is important to note that the CVE description itself is a placeholder.

The content provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than what is present in the basic CVE description.
