```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `crossbeam` crate's `MsQueue` and `SegQueue` data structures did not properly handle the deallocation of elements, leading to a double-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double-free vulnerability due to improper handling of destructors within the epoch-based garbage collector."
    ],
    "impact": "A double-free can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a program crash (segfault), denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by normal usage of the affected queue data structures where elements are pushed and then popped, which can be done through network access, although local access will also trigger the issue.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No specific privileges or user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability. An attacker only needs to be able to use the vulnerable data structures."
