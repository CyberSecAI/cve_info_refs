## Description

#### WP All Import – Simple & Powerful XML, CSV, Google Sheets, and Excel Importer Plugin

*“It’s a wonderful plugin that does so much, so well that it’s hard to list all of the features. But I’ll tell you this, I was able to import the content of a pair of websites running the ModX CMS into a WordPress install in less than 30 minutes. No joke!”*

**Alex Vasquez** – DigiSavvy Co-Founder & WordCamp Los Angeles Organizer

WP All Import has a four-step import process and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that makes complicated import tasks simple and fast.

There are no special requirements that the elements in your file must be laid out in a certain way. WP All Import can import any XML, CSV, Excel spreadsheet, or Google Sheets file into WordPress.

WP All Import can be used for everything from migrating content from a legacy CMS to WordPress to building a store with affiliate datafeed to displaying live stock quotes or sports scores to building a real estate portal.

Check out our [documentation and video tutorials](http://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/?utm_source=import-plugin-free&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs) to make the most of WP All Import.

WP All Import integrates with our companion plugin, [WP All Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-export/). You can export posts, WooCommerce products, orders, users, or anything else with WP All Export. Then you can edit the WordPress data with Microsoft Excel, Numbers, or maybe something else, and re-import to the same site or migrate the data to another site with WP All Import.

For technical support from the developers, please consider purchasing WP All Import Pro.

#### WP All Import Pro Version

*WP All Import Pro* is a paid upgrade that includes premium support and adds the following features:

* Import data to Custom Fields – used by many themes, especially those using Custom Post Types – to store data associated with the posts.
* Import images to the post media gallery – WP All Import can download images from URLs in an XML or CSV file and put them in the media gallery.
* Import files from a URL – Download and import CSV, XML, or Excel WordPress data files from external websites, even if they are password-protected with HTTP authentication.
* Cron Job/Recurring Imports from external URLs – WP All Import Pro can periodically check a file for updates, and add, edit, and delete the imported posts accordingly.
* Execution of Custom PHP Functions on data, i.e., use something like [my\_function({xpath/to/a/field[1]})] in your template, to pass the value of {xpath/to/a/field[1]} to my\_function and display whatever it returns.
* Guaranteed technical support via e-mail.

[Upgrade to the Pro edition of WP All Import.](http://www.wpallimport.com/wordpress-xml-csv-import/?utm_source=import-plugin-free&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=upgrade-to-pro)

Need to [import XML and CSV to WooCommerce?](http://www.wpallimport.com/woocommerce-product-import/?utm_source=import-plugin-free&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=upgrade-to-pro) Check out our WooCommerce add-on.

#### WordPress CSV Imports

Read on to learn more about the CSV importer functionality of WP All Import. Importing CSVs with WP All Import is exactly the same as importing XML files because internally, WP All Import actually converts your CSV file to an XML file on the fly. You can use the same XPath filtering options and all the same features you have when importing XML files.

CSV imports, including those exported from Excel and Google Sheets, don’t require your file to have a specific structure. Your CSV file can use any column names/headings. You can map the columns in your CSV file to the appropriate places in WordPress during the import process.

When importing CSV files, your CSV should have UTF-8 encoding if you are having trouble importing special characters.

In step 2 of a CSV import, you can specify an alternative delimiter if you aren’t using a comma. WP All Import can import CSVs that are pipe-delimited, # delimited, or delimited/separated by any other character.

For CSV import tutorials and example files, visit our [documentation](http://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/?utm_source=import-plugin-free&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=docs). Please keep in mind CSV imports with WP All Import are just like XML imports – you have all the same functionality, and the process is exactly the same. Any of our tutorial videos that apply to XML files also apply to importing CSV files, so if you see a tutorial with us importing an XML file, know that you can follow the exact same steps for a CSV import.

#### WordPress Excel Import / Google Sheets Import

Don’t want to convert your Excel or Google Sheets data to CSV? WP All Import also works as a Google Sheets and Excel importer for WordPress. Simply upload your Excel file as you would for CSV and WP All Import will automatically detect the columns in your file.

For Google Sheets, use the ‘Download a file’ option and paste your sheet’s public URL to import data to WordPress.

#### Add-Ons

A number of premium add-ons are available to add functionality to the importer and make XML, CSV, Google Sheets, and Excel import tasks to complex plugins simple.

* Advanced Custom Fields Add-On – [ACF](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) XML & CSV importer
* WooCommerce Add-On – XML & CSV importer for all [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) product types

Firstly, they have amazing support! The free plugin is very useful for core WordPress database manipulation but getting the Pro Lifetime license was a game changer for me. The ability to work with WooCommerce was the main reason I originally went with the Pro subscription and more recently the addition of the Jet Engine and Gravity Forms addons really just made this as close to an all-in-one solution as I could ask for. As I started to work with membership systems it became even more valuable.
It very handy for pulling custom fields and meta fields from user tables. I love that I can create intricate database reporting UIs with saved export configuration for my clients with this plugin. For example, I have an application where we have a restricted page with buttons for pre-determined user table exports of varying types and filters. The ability to schedule CRON jobs to update those exports periodically is also fantastic. A lot of the other export plugins do not provide URLs to pull exports from so this is really critical here. They even go so far as to have secure serialized URLs for those with the ability to revoke them and create new URLs. Also, the importing capabilities are fantastic and updating posts, pages, products, users etc is really easy. This plugin makes migrating membership plugins or ecommerce platforms pretty straight forward. Thanks to the team at Soflyy!
