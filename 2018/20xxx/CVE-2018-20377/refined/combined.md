# Over 19,000 Orange Livebox ADSL modems are leaking their WiFi credentials

On Friday, December 21, 2018, our honeypots observed an interesting scan consisting of a GET request for /get\_getnetworkconf.cgi. Upon further investigation, we found this traffic was targeting [Orange Livebox ADSL modems](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Livebox). A flaw exists in these modems that allow remote unauthenticated users to obtain the device’s SSID and WiFi password.

![curl request to an affected Orange Livebox ADSL modem](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225im_/https://i2.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/curl-example-1.png?resize=525%2C198&ssl=1)

A simple GET request to “/get\_getnetworkconf.cgi” will reveal the Orange Livebox modem’s WiFi credentials in plaintext.

To assess the amount of devices vulnerable to this flaw, we obtained a list of Orange Livebox modems from [Shodan](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//www.shodan.io/search?query=html%3A%22www.arcadyan.com%2F802%22).

Of the 30,063 IPv4 hosts found, our scans revealed:

* 19,490 leaking their WiFi credentials (SSID/password) in plaintext
* 2,018 not leaking any information, but still exposed to the internet
* 8,391 not responding to our scans

Many of the devices found to be leaking their WiFi password use the same password to administer the device (password reuse) or have not configured any custom password – so the factory default “admin/admin” credentials are still applied.

[![Example Livebox modem status page](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225im_/https://i1.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/livebox-config.png?resize=525%2C409&ssl=1)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//i1.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/livebox-config.png?ssl=1)

Poorly secured Livebox modems enable remote users to view the customer’s phone number, the name/MAC address of all connected clients, and more.

This allows allow any remote user to easily access the device and maliciously modify the device settings or firmware. In addition, they can obtain the phone number tied to the modem and conduct other serious exploits detailed in this [Github repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//github.com/zadewg/LIVEBOX-0DAY).

Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of affected devices were found to be on the network of Orange Espana (AS12479).

![Total affected Livebox modems](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225im_/https://i2.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/count-affected-livebox-modems-1.png?resize=525%2C153&ssl=1)

### Initial scan source

[![The initial scan for Livebox ADSL modems was from detected 81.38.86.204](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225im_/https://i1.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/intial-scan.png?resize=525%2C22&ssl=1)](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//i1.wp.com/badpackets.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/intial-scan.png?ssl=1)

The initial scan detected by our honeypots came from 81.38.86.204 which is an IP address associated to a Telefonica Spain customer. While we can only guess what the motive was behind these scans, it’s interesting to find the source is physically closer to the affected Livebox ADSL modems than say a threat actor in another country. This could allow them to connect to the WiFi network (SSID) if they were near one of the modems indexed by their scans.

### Closing remarks

Due to the sensitive nature of this flaw, the IP addresses of affected Orange Livebox ADSL modems will not be published publicly, however is freely available for law enforcement and CERT teams to review. We’ve shared our findings directly with Orange Espana, Orange-CERT, and [CCN-CERT](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120225/https%3A//www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/) for further investigation and remediation.

The better way of doing it, is creating a separate AP, setting up a password and showing it publicly, then the attacker at least needs to intercept an individual handshake before being able to decrypt a portion of traffic. The even better way is WPA-Enterprise, but... In short, the Wi-Fi standard itself unnecessarily forces everyone to make a hard choice between security and openness. Fortunately, and hopefully, the awakened situation is going to be solved, WPA3 supports encryption on an open AP. Also, WPA3 offers forward secrecy, the traffic cannot be decrypted by passive monitoring unless the attacker is also a Man-in-the-Middle. BTW, as tyingq said, copyright is a factor, but I think laws in generally are a bigger problem. Under the laws of many jurisdictions, the Wi-Fi user may be responsible for all the legal consequences of other people who is using his/her Wi-Fi. Routing the guest AP over an anonymous VPN connected via Tor may be a solution to the legal challenge, but a legal issue needs a real legal solution.

A few years back (turn of the decade) I discovered a similar problem in the equipment of a fairly large ISP, albeit a little bit more serious (think root access). Their fix was to put that port behind a whitelist, with the only IP address able to access it remotely belonging to the ISP. The problem is, this is one of those ISPs that have an extra SSID on their CPEs for "free" internet, think Xfinity, but this wasn't Comcast, and this vulnerability stems from an HTTPd misconfiguration, so if you can access the equipment's HTTPd (all you need to do is a single, unauthenticated request, so, really any access will do), you've got full access. I went through some trouble to contact, via third parties, an insider at this ISP with the power to get things fixed - they did fix the remote part (via the aforementioned firewall whitelisting), but I was told, in no uncertain terms, that they didn't care enough to fix the root of the issue, as long as it wasn't massively exploitable, and it wasn't public. I like my freedom/money too much to publicize details, and so it's still there, all these years later. I wonder how many vulnerabilities like this are out there, fully known by the vendors/providers, but nothing gets done about them because people are too scared to disclose, until eventually someone comes along and blows the whistle, or the equipment is obsoleted? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [j1elo](user?id=j1elo) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747787)   | [parent](#18747551) | [next](#18746434) [–]  Doing some anonymous disclosure wouldn't be an option?

The bad thing is nowadays they usually came from the ISP as a modem/router combined unit, and neither the performance nor security is ideal. I always see an ISP-provided router as a hazardous & untrusted device. If it offers bridged PPPoE, I would configure it so it works as a pure modem, even it means breaking into the telnet console. Otherwise, I would rather put my own router behind it, double-NAT and firewall it out of my own network. In Germany, the *Choice and Connection of Telecommunication Terminal Devices Act* have been passed with the support of free and open source community, which ensure a user can use their own router to connect a broadband network. <https://fsfe.org/activities/routers/timeline.en.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [marmottus](user?id=marmottus) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746645)   | [root](#18746434) | [parent](#18746532) | [next](#18747154) [–]  If you live in/know about Germany, could you suggest a good alternative to the Kabel Deutschland basic CBN router?

I've seen many modems with a web interface, but it's often not routable to the public Internet in actual use, as the connection was bridged and the job of getting a public IP has been delegated to the PPPoE connection on the router behind it (You need to add another network interface, assign a IP address on your router inside the LAN segment under the control of the modem to reach it). Some modems have a management link, it can be described as an universal ISP backdoor, only reachable in the ISP's LAN. But in both cases, it's still better than a modem/router combined unit. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [agumonkey](user?id=agumonkey) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746615)   | [parent](#18746434) | [prev](#18746532) | [next](#18747135) [–]  In Orange case, I opened a previous livebox model and it was built by Sagem.

One of our customers (we're a security firm) was about to ship their modem/router with some firmware on it of chinese origin. The quality of the code (not just security bugs, but just bugs) was astounding. A colleague picked three lines of code at random, not even looking for a particularly bad part, to explain how this had multiple vulnerabilities. He identified four at first glance. Upon reviewing the report internally, we found two more. Six security vulns in three random lines of code. It was truly astounding. Lots of them were mitigated due to other bugs preventing you from actually reaching the code when you pass funny input, or the code turns out to be unused (random unused code in your binaries is a big code smell). It was functional: they clearly made sure it all worked. But if you would try to do anything outside of the happy flow, it would bug. The customer also had quite a fight over getting the source code (instead of binaries) in the first place. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cptskippy](user?id=cptskippy) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746599)   | [parent](#18746434) | [prev](#18747135) | [next](#18746125) [–]  In the US, the major players use Arris Modems and Gateways. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jasonjayr](user?id=jasonjayr) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746125)   | [prev](#18746434) | [next](#18746231) [–]  Though not technically a leak, Verizon's FiOS routers report your current WIFI password to Verizon (not just the default the router ships with), presumably for customer support reasons.

Then their laptop crashes and they need their replacement laptop to connect to the WiFi. This is also the moment a customer will straight up deny the existence of ethernet cables or claim to have never heard of any Internet-related device that does not use WiFi. To satisfy these customers, you need to be able to either read out the WiFi password or have some way to push a new one. As it's just plain easier to just allow full-on access to the modem GUI for their customer service agents, it's often possible to read any passwords or settings from the help desk. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [y04nn](user?id=y04nn) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747964)   | [root](#18746125) | [parent](#18746907) | [next](#18746231) [–]  I would not expect my ISP to have access to my plaintext WIFI password.

I tweeted Troy to let them know. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ded7xSEoPKYNsDd](user?id=Ded7xSEoPKYNsDd) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18745888)   | [parent](#18745847) | [next](#18746398) [–]  <https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1076797149524811777> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ytqaz](user?id=ytqaz) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746398)   | [prev](#18745847) [–]  This would be completely mitigated by rolling out CG-NAT for all customers. Orange Espana has been working on this for their fibre customers (I think almost all of them are behind CG-NAT already), but ADSL customers are still waiting for it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [philjohn](user?id=philjohn) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746482)   | [parent](#18746398) | [next](#18746446) [–]  Well, except for attackers behind the CG-NAT. Also, CG-Nat is a HORRIBLE technology that causes lots of problems for subscribers all fo the sake of allowing an ISP to sell their IPV4 space off at a premium and pump up their numbers if a quarter demands it. I'm with Virgin cable in the UK and they are going to IPv6 soon ... but with DS-Lite, so CG-NAT for IPv4 (yay, I can't connect back to my home VPN if I'm on an IPv4 only network) but native IPv6 (sort of yay). You then also have the issues with online services, IP bans etc. etc. etc. CG-NAT is nothing to be cheered on, and is worse than useless for "security". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [robk](user?id=robk) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747034)   | [root](#18746398) | [parent](#18746482) | [next](#18746446) [–]  Is that definite on Virgin? Seems uncertain still... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [philjohn](user?id=philjohn) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18748173)   | [root](#18746398) | [parent](#18747034) | [next](#18746446) [–]  It's the method LG have decided on for all their cable networks, and according to this presentation from earlier this month, it's still the plan (and let's face it, if they changed to dual stack now it would take them another 4+ years to get it rolled out ... snails have NOTHING on the LG network operations team): [https://www.ipv6.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/LG-Virgin...](https://www.ipv6.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/LG-Virgin-IPv6-Rollout-UK-IPv6-Council.pdf) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jstanley](user?id=jstanley) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746446)   | [parent](#18746398) | [prev](#18746482) | [next](#18746476) [–]  It is not reasonable to apply "carrier-grade NAT" to residential internet connections. I'm paying for internet service, I don't want some locked-down system that can't receive inbound connections. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JorgeGT](user?id=JorgeGT) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746476)   | [parent](#18746398) | [prev](#18746446) | [next](#18747158) [–]  I specifically requested (and got) to be outside their CG-NAT. It worked horribly (the ports got reset every other day, and some other customer could have taken the port you wanted at that point) and some applications with ports hardcoded over number 2000 did not work. People with PPTP VPNs could not use them anymore. Plus, enjoy getting banned from things because you share your IPv4 with plenty of strangers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ytqaz](user?id=ytqaz) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746566)   | [root](#18746398) | [parent](#18746476) | [next](#18747158) [–]  You specifically requested to be outside their CGNAT, and now look at your CPE, wide open to the WAN. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [JorgeGT](user?id=JorgeGT) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746618)   | [root](#18746398) | [parent](#18746566) | [next](#18747190) [–]  "Orange's CGNAT, at least better than our compromised CPE" is certainly catchy PR. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [voidwtf](user?id=voidwtf) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747190)   | [root](#18746398) | [parent](#18746566) | [prev](#18746618) | [next](#18747158) [–]  Ehm, what? So you trust the ISP to implement CG-NAT properly when they can’t manage to secure a simple CPE router? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [voidwtf](user?id=voidwtf) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747158)   | [parent](#18746398) | [prev](#18746476) | [next](#18747194) [–]  This is possibly the worst reason I’ve ever heard of for CG-NAT. CG-NAT has so many issues for consumers that will end up hoisted onto other services/applications support departments. The internet is not a one way street and there are many legitimate reasons for listening ports that I’m surprised anybody would push for CG-NAT. I can’t even imagine trying to be get through to an ISP to fix their CG-NAT issue. It’s hard enough to get them to fix routing issues without being established on an industry mailing list or having an existing contact. Nobody wants the AOL internet of yesteryear and IMO CG-NAT is just a step in that direction. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lucb1e](user?id=lucb1e) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18747194)   | [parent](#18746398) | [prev](#18747158) | [next](#18746461) [–]  What you're really asking for is carrier-grade stateful firewalls. It just so happens that NAT has a firewall-like effect, along with lots of issues for peer to peer applications (something obscure called Skype used to do that, among others) and power users. NAT is not a solution but a problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Faaak](user?id=Faaak) [on Dec 23, 2018](item?id=18746461)   | [parent](#18746398) | [prev](#18747194) [–]  Your argument is as bad as saying: "Well, that could be mitigated by not having internet" | | --- | --- | --- | | |
