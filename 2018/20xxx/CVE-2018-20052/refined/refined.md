Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cerner Connectivity Engine (CCE) 4 devices have a misconfiguration where the user running the main CCE firmware has NOPASSWD sudo privileges to several utilities. This allows for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure sudo configuration:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive sudo configuration, allowing the CCE firmware user to execute commands as root without a password.
- **Use of exploitable utilities:** Specifically, the availability of `ln` allows an attacker to create symbolic links that can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can escalate privileges from the CCE firmware user to root. This allows them to gain full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** The vulnerability can be exploited through local access to the device's command line.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the device with the ability to run commands.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is described with the example command: `sudo ln -s /tmp/script /etc/cron.hourly/script`

This command demonstrates how an attacker can create a symbolic link within the cron.hourly directory pointing to a malicious script in the /tmp directory. Because cron.hourly scripts are executed with root privileges, the attacker can then achieve arbitrary code execution as root by placing a malicious script within `/tmp/script`.

This vulnerability is present in Cerner Connectivity Engine (CCE) 4 Firmware build prior to 12/2018.
