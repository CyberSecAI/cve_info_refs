Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-20199:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `ifilter_bank` function within `libfaad/filtbank.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash of the application, leading to a denial of service. This prevents the software from processing audio files correctly.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some sources suggest that in general, dereferencing a null pointer can be exploited for arbitrary code execution, depending on the environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted MPEG AAC data:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG AAC audio file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious audio file to the vulnerable software.
- This could be done via a local file path or potentially via remote access if the application is processing files from an external source.
- The attacker needs no prior access to the system if the application process the crafted file in an unsupervised manner.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects FAAD2 versions prior to 2.9.0.
*   The issue has been addressed in Debian LTS via DLA-1899-1, DLA-2792-1, and in Debian stable via DSA-5109-1.
