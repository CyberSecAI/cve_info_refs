[Gist here](https://gist.github.com/Vurich/ffa55d8e69377a64c9708e07c2db2a1b). A solution to this would be to set `len = index` before iterating. Obviously this would cause leaks but we're already leaking data.

(Sorry for the very verbose explanation in the linked gist but I wanted to link it as part of an article whose audience might not immediately understand the problem).

### Description

If an iterator passed to `SmallVec::insert_many` panicked in `Iterator::next`,
destructors were run during unwinding while the vector was in an inconsistent
state, possibly causing a double free (a destructor running on two copies of
the same value).

This is fixed in smallvec 0.6.3 by ensuring that the vector's length is not
updated to include moved items until they have been removed from their
original positions. Items may now be leaked if `Iterator::next` panics, but
they will not be dropped more than once.

Thank you to @Vurich for reporting this bug.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
