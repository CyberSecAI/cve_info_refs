The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager version 9.13.4. This information is not related to CVE-2018-20791.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary file read via path traversal:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal via the `path` parameter in the `get_file` action of `ajax_calls.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization allows the attacker to read any file on the system.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files, such as `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `path` parameter set to a file path using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php`

2.  **Arbitrary file read via path traversal through `copy_cut` and `paste_clipboard`:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal via the `path` parameter in the `copy_cut` action of `ajax_calls.php`, which is then used in the `paste_clipboard` action of `execute.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization allows the attacker to copy files to the clipboard using path traversal. The paste operation saves it to the `upload_dir`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files by first copying the file and then pasting it.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `sub_action=copy` and `path` parameter set to a file path using path traversal sequences. Then a second POST request to `execute.php` with `action=paste_clipboard`
    *  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php` and `/filemanager/execute.php`

3.  **Arbitrary file write via path traversal mitigation bypass:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application attempts to mitigate path traversal but can be bypassed by using an array in the `paths` parameter of `create_file` action in `execute.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Mitigation bypass through an array parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to any location on the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=create_file`, and an array in `paths` parameter to bypass mitigation, `names` parameter containing the name of file and `new_content` with the content to be written.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php`.

4.  **Arbitrary file deletion via path traversal mitigation bypass:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application attempts to mitigate path traversal but can be bypassed by using an array in the `paths` parameter of `delete_file` action in `execute.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Mitigation bypass through an array parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=delete_file` and an array in the `paths` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php`.

5.  **Arbitrary directory deletion via path traversal mitigation bypass:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application attempts to mitigate path traversal but can be bypassed by using an array in the `paths` parameter of `delete_folder` action in `execute.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Mitigation bypass through an array parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary directories on the server.
    *  **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=delete_folder` and an array in the `paths` parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php`.

6.  **Arbitrary file write with limited extensions:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal via the `path` parameter in the `save_img` action of `ajax_calls.php` with limited extensions (jpg/jpeg/png).
    *   **Weakness:** The application allows a file to be written to the file system with path traversal.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to any location on the server with an image extension (jpg, jpeg, png).
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `action=save_img`, `path` parameter set to the desired location, `name` parameter set to the desired name and a `url` parameter pointing to the file.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php`

7.  **Persistent XSS:**
    *   **Root cause:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied file names when previewing media files.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization of file names when previewing media.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **Attack vector:** Uploading a media file with an XSS payload in the file name, and then having a user preview the file.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to upload files to the application.
