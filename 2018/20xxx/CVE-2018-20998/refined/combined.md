### Description

The attribute repr() added to enums to be compatible with C-FFI caused
memory corruption on MSVC toolchain.

arrayfire crates <= version 3.5.0 do not have this issue when used with
Rust versions 1.27 or earlier. The issue only started to appear since
Rust version 1.28.

The issue seems to be interlinked with which version of Rust is being used.

The issue was fixed in crate 3.6.0.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| Memory corruption is potentially a security issue. I've only skimmed the code, but it seems that a buffer overflow could happen because of incorrect in-memory representation of a field affecting the amount of memory to operate on.  Please add this issue to the [Rust security advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) so people could check if they're running a vulnerable version and upgrade. |

| [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) Thank you for sharing it.  I am not quite sure how to present this as per rust-sec template because it doesn't ask at which verion of rust the issue starts to appear.  As per investigation reported on [#176](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/issues/176) , there doesn't seem to be any issue on crate versions 3.5.0 or earlier wtih Rust 1.27 or earlier. The issue appears from rust 1.28 and as per Rust's 1.28.0 release notes, it is the version where `#[repr(transparent)]`  attribute was stabilized. I wonder if it has something to do with that. Additionally, this happened only with MSVC toolchain.  What do you think of this scenario ? |

| [@9prady9](https://github.com/9prady9) is correct we presently have no way to file advisories which only apply to certain Rust versions.  Failing that however, you can just file the advisory for all impacted versions of the crate, regardless of the Rust version. Users of Rust versions older than 1.28 may see a "false positive", but since it seems to impact all versions going forward I'm not sure how much that matters. |

| File an advisory and include information about the impacted Rust version in the description. It may cause some false positives, but I think that's the best you can do for now. |

# ArrayFire Rust Bindings

[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) is a high performance library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. It
enables users to write scientific computing code that is portable across CUDA, OpenCL and CPU
devices. This project provides Rust bindings for the ArrayFire library. Given below table shows
the rust bindings compatability with ArrayFire. If you find any bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/issues).

| arrayfire-rust | ArrayFire |
| --- | --- |
| M.m.p1 | M.m.p2 |

Only, Major(M) & Minor(m) version numbers need to match. *p1* and *p2* are patch/fix updates for
`arrayfire-rust` & `ArrayFire` respectively, and they don't need to match.

## Supported platforms

Linux, Windows and OSX. Rust 1.31 or newer is required.

## Use from Crates.io

To use the rust bindings for ArrayFire from crates.io, the following requirements are to be met first.

1. [Download and install ArrayFire binaries](https://arrayfire.com/download) based on your operating system. Depending on the
   method of your installation for Linux, steps (2) & (3) may not be required. If that is the case,
   proceed to step (4) directly.
2. Set the evironment variable `AF_PATH` to point to ArrayFire installation root folder.
3. Make sure to add the path to lib files to your path environment variables.
   * On Linux: do `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$AF_PATH/lib64`
   * On OSX: do `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$AF_PATH/lib`
   * On Windows: Add `%AF_PATH%\lib` to your PATH environment variable.
4. Add `arrayfire = "3.8"` to the dependencies section of your project's Cargo.toml file.
   Make sure to change the version to latest available.

Once step (4) is over, you should be able to use ArrayFire in your Rust project. If you find any
bugs, please report them [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/issues).

## Build from Source

Edit [build.conf](/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust/blob/master/build.conf) to modify the build flags. The structure is a simple JSON blob.
Currently Rust does not allow key:value pairs to be passed from the CLI. To use an existing
ArrayFire installation modify the first three JSON values. You can install ArrayFire using
one of the following two ways.

* [Download and install binaries](https://arrayfire.com/download)
* [Build and install from source](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)

To build arrayfire submodule available in the rust wrapper repository, you have to do the following.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build // use --all to build all crates in the workspace
```

This is recommended way to build Rust wrapper since the submodule points to the most compatible
version of ArrayFire the Rust wrapper has been tested with. You can find the ArrayFire dependencies below.

* [Linux](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Build-Instructions-for-Linux)
* [OSX](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Build-Instructions-for-OSX)
* [Windows](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Build-Instructions-for-Windows)

## Example

```
let num_rows: u64 = 5;
let num_cols: u64 = 3;
let dims = Dim4::new(&[num_rows, num_cols, 1, 1]);
let a = randu::<f32>(dims);
af_print!("Create a 5-by-3 matrix of random floats on the GPU", a);
```

### Sample output

```
~/p/arrayfire_rust> cargo run --example helloworld
...
Create a 5-by-3 matrix of random floats on the GPU
[5 3 1 1]
    0.7402     0.4464     0.7762
    0.9210     0.6673     0.2948
    0.0390     0.1099     0.7140
    0.9690     0.4702     0.3585
    0.9251     0.5132     0.6814
...
```

### Troubleshooting

If the build command fails with undefined references errors even after taking care of environment
variables, we recommend doing a `cargo clean` and re-running `cargo build` or `cargo test`.

You can also use some environment variables mentioned in our [book](http://arrayfire.org/arrayfire-rust/book/configuring_arrayfire_environment.html), such as `AF_PRINT_ERRORS`
to print more elaborate error messages to console.
