Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of the `repr()` attribute on enums within the `arrayfire` crate, specifically when used in conjunction with the C-FFI (Foreign Function Interface). This caused memory corruption when compiled with the MSVC toolchain. The issue was triggered by changes in Rust 1.28, specifically the stabilization of the `#[repr(transparent)]` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Enum Representation:** The `repr()` attribute caused the Rust enums to have an incorrect in-memory representation, which didn't match the expected C ABI layout.
- **Memory Corruption:** This mismatch in memory layout led to potential memory corruption, likely through buffer overflows or incorrect memory access during FFI calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unpredictable behavior.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  The CVSS score indicates high impact on all three, suggesting that a successful exploit could lead to loss of confidentiality (data leaks), integrity (unauthorized modifications), and availability (system crashes).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, meaning the exploit does not require complex steps to execute.
- **No User Interaction or Privileges Required:** Exploitation doesn't require user interaction and can be triggered by an attacker without special privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable application via network.
- **Ability to trigger the vulnerable code:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that the vulnerable enum is used.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable code:** The attacker would need some knowledge on where/how to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was specific to the MSVC toolchain and appeared starting with Rust version 1.28.
- The vulnerability was resolved in `arrayfire` crate version 3.6.0.
- Affected architectures were `x86_64` and operating system was `windows`
- The vulnerability also affected the `pip` package.
