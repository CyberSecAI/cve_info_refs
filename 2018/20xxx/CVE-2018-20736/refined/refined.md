{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, meaning the malicious script execution occurs within the user's browser by manipulating the Document Object Model of the web page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DOM-based XSS"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is limited due to the CVSS score: Confidentiality Low, Integrity None and Availability None. An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts that could read user information, but since the attack is limited to a specific user's session, other users are not affected. The user must be tricked into clicking a manipulated link to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), through the manipulation of a URL that triggers the XSS. The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload and trick a high privileged user (PR:H) into visiting the specially crafted URL.  The user interaction (UI:R) is required.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user with high privileges to access the manipulated URL."
