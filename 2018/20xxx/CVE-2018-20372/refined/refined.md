- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of Tenda, Dlink, and Tplink ADSL2+ Modem Routers, specifically in how DHCP hostnames are handled. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying DHCP client lists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization/output encoding of DHCP hostnames within the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Phishing attacks
    - Session hijacking
    - Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
    - Persistent manipulation of the affected web module's context.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote attackers can inject malicious script code by modifying DHCP hostnames using POST requests.
    - Local privileged users can also inject the malicious script through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Low privileged user account on the router's web application.
    - The ability to send POST requests to the router's web interface.
    - Low user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
