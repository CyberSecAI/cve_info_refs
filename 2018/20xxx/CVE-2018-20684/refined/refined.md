{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The scp client implementation fails to properly validate object names received from the server, allowing a malicious server to send files that were not requested by the client. Additionally, the client does not sanitize the object names when displaying them in the progress meter, allowing the server to inject ANSI control codes and potentially hide file transfers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation",
        "CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious scp server can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory, change the target directory permissions and to spoof the client output.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-Middle attack",
        "Compromised SCP server"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the server or be positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. For the MitM scenario the client has to accept an incorrect host fingerprint."
