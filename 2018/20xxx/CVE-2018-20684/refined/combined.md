scp client multiple vulnerabilities
===================================
The latest version of this advisory is available at:
https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt
Overview
--------
SCP clients from multiple vendors are susceptible to a malicious scp server performing
unauthorized changes to target directory and/or client output manipulation.
Description
-----------
Many scp clients fail to verify if the objects returned by the scp server match those
it asked for. This issue dates back to 1983 and rcp, on which scp is based. A separate
flaw in the client allows the target directory attributes to be changed arbitrarily.
Finally, two vulnerabilities in clients may allow server to spoof the client output.
Impact
------
Malicious scp server can write arbitrary files to scp target directory, change the
target directory permissions and to spoof the client output.
Details
-------
The discovered vulnerabilities, described in more detail below, enables the attack
described here in brief.
1. The attacker controlled server or Man-in-the-Middle(\*) attack drops .bash\_aliases
file to victim's home directory when the victim performs scp operation from the
server. The transfer of extra files is hidden by sending ANSI control sequences
via stderr. For example:
user@local:~$ scp user@remote:readme.txt .
readme.txt 100% 494 1.6KB/s 00:00
user@local:~$
2. Once the victim launches a new shell, the malicious commands in .bash\_aliases get
executed.
\*) Man-in-the-Middle attack does require the victim to accept the wrong host
fingerprint.
Vulnerabilities
---------------
1. CWE-20: scp client improper directory name validation [CVE-2018-20685]
The scp client allows server to modify permissions of the target directory by using empty
("D0777 0 \n") or dot ("D0777 0 .\n") directory name.
2. CWE-20: scp client missing received object name validation [CVE-2019-6111]
Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp [1], the server chooses which
files/directories are sent to the client. However, scp client only perform cursory
validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented).
A malicious scp server can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory.
If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories
as well (for example overwrite .ssh/authorized\_keys).
The same vulnerability in WinSCP is known as CVE-2018-20684.
3. CWE-451: scp client spoofing via object name [CVE-2019-6109]
Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, the object name can be used
to manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes to hide additional
files being transferred.
4. CWE-451: scp client spoofing via stderr [CVE-2019-6110]
Due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the scp server, a
malicious server can manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes
to hide additional files being transferred.
Proof-of-Concept
----------------
Proof of concept malicious scp server will be released at a later date.
Vulnerable versions
-------------------
The following software packages have some or all vulnerabilities:
ver #1 #2 #3 #4
OpenSSH scp <=7.9 x x x x
PuTTY PSCP ? - - x x
WinSCP scp mode <=5.13 - x - -
Tectia SSH scpg3 is not affected since it exclusively uses sftp protocol.
Mitigation
----------
1. OpenSSH
1.1 Switch to sftp if possible
1.2 Apply the following patches to scp:
CVE-2018-20685: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=6010c0303a422a9c5fa8860c061bf7105eb7f8b2
CVE-2019-6109: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=8976f1c4b2721c26e878151f52bdf346dfe2d54c
CVE-2019-6111: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=391ffc4b9d31fa1f4ad566499fef9176ff8a07dc
1.3 Alternatively apply the following patch to harden scp against most server-side
manipulation attempts: https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-name-validator.patch
NOTE: This unofficial patch may cause problems if the the remote and local shells
don't agree on the way glob() pattern matching works. YMMV.
2. PuTTY
2.1 No fix is available yet
3. WinSCP
3.1. Upgrade to WinSCP 5.14 or later
Similar or prior work
---------------------
1. CVE-2000-0992 - scp overwrites arbitrary files

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2627487.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Notes

---

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
sftp instead of scp.
Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html
upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of
2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing
this issue in Ubuntu stable releases.

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding
in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker)
can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by
using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This
affects refresh\_progress\_meter() in progressmeter.c.
