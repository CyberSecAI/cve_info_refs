{
  "CVE-2018-20542": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `libxsmm_sparse_csc_reader` function due to incorrect bounds checking when processing sparse matrix data, specifically in the allocation and access of memory for row indices.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-buffer-overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service by corrupting memory. Specifically, a write out-of-bounds is triggered in `src/generator_spgemm_csc_reader.c:178`, after the allocation in `src/generator_spgemm_csc_reader.c:125`.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted sparse matrix file that causes an out-of-bounds write during the parsing of the data.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious sparse matrix file as input to the vulnerable `libxsmm_sparse_csc_reader` function. No specific position is mentioned."
    },
    "affected_files": [
      "src/generator_spgemm_csc_reader.c"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The provided github commit (1514814) attempts to fix this issue by adding a check for valid matrix dimensions during the parsing of matrix files. This issue was initially reported against Fedora but was deemed not a Fedora bug after verification by RedHat."
