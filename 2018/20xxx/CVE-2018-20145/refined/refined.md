The provided content relates to a security vulnerability in Eclipse Mosquitto. Specifically, it addresses an issue where the `acl_file` setting was ignored for the default listener when `per_listener_settings` was set to true.

- **CVE-2018-20145 is likely related to the information provided.**

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** When `per_listener_settings` was set to true in the Mosquitto configuration, the `acl_file` setting (used for access control) was ignored *only* for the "default listener". Listeners defined explicitly using the `listener` option were *not* affected.
*   **Root Cause:** The configuration parsing logic in `src/conf.c` likely failed to correctly propagate the `acl_file` setting from the default listener configuration to the actual listener when `per_listener_settings` was enabled.
*   **Impact:** If an administrator relied on the `acl_file` to restrict access to the default listener with `per_listener_settings` enabled, those access controls would *not* be enforced, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the MQTT broker.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially exploit this by connecting to the default listener and performing actions that should have been restricted by the `acl_file`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the MQTT broker on the default listener. No authentication would be required if the ACL was meant to restrict unauthenticated users.
*   **Affected Versions:** This issue was present in versions prior to the fix (likely before 1.5.5).
*   **Mitigation:** The issue was fixed in version 1.5.5 by ensuring the `acl_file` setting is correctly applied to the default listener when `per_listener_settings` is enabled.

The provided commit fixes this vulnerability by correctly assigning the `acl_file` from the `default_listener.security_options` to the newly created listener in `config__parse_args` function within `src/conf.c`.
