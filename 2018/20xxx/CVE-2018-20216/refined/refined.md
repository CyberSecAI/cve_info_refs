Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the QEMU implementation of the VMWare paravirtual RDMA (PVRDMA) device. Specifically, it stems from a failure to properly check return values from the `pvrdma_idx_ring_has_data` and `pvrdma_idx_ring_has_space` routines within the `pvrdma_dev_ring.c` file. These routines can return `PVRDMA_INVALID_IDX` (-1) if a ring has no data/space. Not checking for this invalid index leads to potential infinite loops in `pvrdma_qp_send` and `pvrdma_qp_recv` functions when transferring data using QP ring objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Return Value Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks for the return value of `pvrdma_idx_ring_has_data` and `pvrdma_idx_ring_has_space` functions. This results in the possibility of using an invalid index, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Infinite Loop Vulnerability:** The code did not account for scenarios where there was no data to read or no space to write in the ring buffer, potentially causing an infinite loop when the index returned was invalid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user or process can exploit this vulnerability to cause an infinite loop in the QEMU process, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition for the host system. The QEMU process will get stuck in the loop, making it unresponsive.
- **Resource Exhaustion:**  The infinite loop could exhaust CPU resources on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Guest-to-Host:** The attack vector is from inside the guest virtual machine. A malicious process within the guest can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Guest User/Process:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the guest operating system.
- **Access to PVRDMA Device:** The guest needs to have access to the vulnerable PVRDMA device.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Li Qiang.
- The fix involved adding checks for invalid index return values in the mentioned functions.
- The issue was resolved by disabling PVRDMA support in Ubuntu 18.10, and by patching the QEMU package in affected Ubuntu versions.
