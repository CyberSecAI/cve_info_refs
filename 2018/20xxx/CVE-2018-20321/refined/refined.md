Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-20321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Rancher created a service account named “netes-default” in the "default" namespace. This service account was granted the "cluster-admin" clusterRole, which provides full administrator privileges to the cluster.
- The "default" namespace was placed into the Default project which is accessible to non-admin users.
- Any project member with access to the "default" namespace could use the “netes-default” service account to execute administrator level API calls against the Kubernetes cluster. This is because, once a service account is created in a namespace, any member with access to that namespace can use that service account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A user with regular member-level privileges within the Default project could escalate to cluster-admin privileges by using the improperly placed service account.
- **Incorrect Service Account Placement:** The service account with cluster-admin privileges was placed in a namespace and project intended for use by non-admin users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Cluster Control:** An attacker could gain full control over the Kubernetes cluster by utilizing the service account to execute administrator-level API calls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the default namespace as a project member.
- The attacker would use the "netes-default" service account to perform privileged actions

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a member of a project in Rancher that includes the default namespace (or have member level privileges in the default namespace).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affected all Rancher versions from v2.0.0 to v2.1.5.
- The fix involved deleting the service account from the "default" namespace and recreating it in the "cattle-system" namespace (or "System" project in versions 2.0.8 and later) which is not accessible by normal project members.
- Mitigation steps were provided for users who could not immediately upgrade which involved quarantining the default namespace.
