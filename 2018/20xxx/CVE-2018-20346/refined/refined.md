Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the FTS3 extension of SQLite. This occurs during FTS3 queries after crafted changes are made to FTS3 shadow tables, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** A calculation involving the size of data to be copied overflows, causing a buffer overflow in a subsequent memory copy operation.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to writing data beyond the boundaries of a buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of the FTS3 shadow tables and resulting query parameters.
*  **Unprotected Shadow Tables:** The shadow tables, where FTS3 stored internal metadata were writable by user supplied SQL, leading to corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the SQLite application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow can lead to crashes and application malfunctions, causing a denial of service.
*  **Data Corruption:** Databases can be corrupted by crafted SQL statements.
*   **Information Leakage:** In some cases, the over-read or use-after-free issues caused by the overflow can lead to information leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Statements:** Exploitation requires the ability to execute arbitrary SQL statements on a SQLite database.
*   **WebSQL Interface:** Chromium (and potentially other browsers with WebSQL support) is vulnerable because it exposes SQLite through a web interface.
*   **Corrupted Database Files:** Specially crafted databases can trigger the vulnerability if loaded by applications that do not properly validate the files, though this is less common.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute SQL:** The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements against the SQLite database. In the case of Chrome, this is via the WebSQL interface.
*  **Some access to the SQLite database or the application which uses it.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is also referred to as "Magellan."
*   The issue was addressed in SQLite version 3.25.3.
*   SQLite version 3.26.0 added the `SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE` option, which can help protect against similar issues in the future by making shadow tables read-only. However, this is not the actual fix to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists in the FTS3 extension, and not in the core SQLite library itself.
*   Many applications that use SQLite may not be directly vulnerable to remote attacks, as they don't expose direct SQL access to untrusted users. However, the SQLite library itself remains a potential entry point when used improperly.
* The patch applied to correct the vulnerability does not prevent corruption of internal databases. It only prevents the corruption from leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   Some sources indicate that Firefox, unlike Chromium, is not vulnerable to this issue, as it does not use WebSQL.
* The vulnerability is mainly triggered by crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables and subsequent FTS3 queries.
