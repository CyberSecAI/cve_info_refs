# Multiple remote code execution flaws in sqlite (Magellan)

## Overview

Multiple remote code execution flaws were reported in SQLite. Attackers can trigger this flaw by executing arbitrary SQL statements on SQLite database and can result in execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the SQLite application. This vulnerability is also known as "Magellan".

This flaw does NOT affect the version of sqlite package shipped with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.

## Affected Products

| Product | Package | Advisory/Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary | chromium-browser | [RHSA-2018:3803](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3803) |

## Analysis

The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements in order to corrupt the databases and run arbitrary code as the user running SQLite applications. This is uncommon in applications; normally only administrative users are allowed to run SQL statements.

Chromium however exposes SQLite via WebSQL. This issue was address by Chromium 71.0.3578.80 via [RHSA-2018:3803](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3803)

Mozilla Firefox uses SQLite only to store internal profile information, browsing history, and other similar information and should not be exploitable remotely.

| [Description](#c0)  Edward Muller    2002-02-12 22:02:47 UTC  ``` Here are new ebuilds for bonobo (v1.0.19), oaf (0.6.8) and ORBit(0.5.13).  The bonobo upgrade to v1.0.19 closes [bug #671](show_bug.cgi?id=671 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution mail based keyboard shortcuts stop working"). The others are along for the ride. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-13 13:28:00 UTC  ``` I don't see the attachements, but oh, well.  New ebuilds should be on rsync by now. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Edward Muller    2002-02-13 17:10:32 UTC  ``` Since I can't upload the files via bugzilla I've posted them on my website. -- Bonobo 1.0.19  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/bonobo-1.0.19.ebuild>  New upstream release, fixes [bug #671](show_bug.cgi?id=671 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution mail based keyboard shortcuts stop working") -- OAF 0.6.8  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/oaf-0.6.8.ebuild>  New upstream release. -- ORBit 0.5.13  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/ORBit-0.5.13.ebuild> <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/alloca.diff>  New upstream release. The alloca patch will probably be incorporated in future versions. It fixes a problem that becomes apparent when compiling the latest version of gnome-applets (updated ebuild to follow). --   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Edward Muller    2002-02-13 17:11:14 UTC  ``` I couldn't upload the ebuilds. Someone on IRC verified the problem last night and was going to try to fix it. Looks like it's still broken though for me. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-14 10:40:56 UTC  ``` Added.  Thanks! ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-14 08:24:31 UTC  ``` Multiple flaws were found in sqlite. An attacker who is able to run arbitrary SQL statements could use this flaw to corrupt the internal databases, which can lead to arbitrary code execution as the user running sqlite.  This issue was fixed via sqlite-3.25.3 release at: <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_25_3.html>  Also sqlite-3.36 introduced SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option which when added to the config file, could prevent attackers for corrupting the internal database files. This could however break applications which require users to write these database files. <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_26_0.html> <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdefensive>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 03:25:09 UTC  ``` Created sqlite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1659677](show_bug.cgi?id=1659677 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-20346 sqlite: Multiple flaws in sqlite which can be triggered via corrupted internal databases (Magellan) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 04:35:38 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1659363](show_bug.cgi?id=1659363 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - sqlite: Multiple security flaws in sqlite triggered via corrupted database files (Magellan)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c12)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 04:45:39 UTC  ``` Notes on exploitation:  The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements in order to corrupt the databases and run arbitrary code as the user running sqlite applications. This is uncommon in applications, normally only administrative users are allowed to run SQL statements.  Chromium however exposes sqlite via WebSQL. This issue was address by Chromium 71.0.3578.80 via [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3803](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3803)  Mozilla firefox uses sqlite only to store internal profile information, browsing history etc, therefore should not be exploitable remotely.  Also refer to: <https://www.sqlite.org/security.html> for sqlite >= 3.26.0   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c20)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-17 07:48:52 UTC  ``` Created mingw-sqlite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1659907](show_bug.cgi?id=1659907 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-20346 mingw-sqlite: sqlite: Multiple flaws in sqlite which can be triggered via corrupted internal databases (Magellan) [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1659908](show_bug.cgi?id=1659908 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-20346 mingw-sqlite: sqlite: Multiple flaws in sqlite which can be triggered via corrupted internal databases (Magellan) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c23)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-18 06:43:13 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3758321> <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html> <https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c27)  Justin Clift    2018-12-25 20:45:50 UTC  ``` As a data point, the Magellan vulnerability may be applicable to the sqlite package in EL7 base too:    sqlite-3.7.17-8.el7.x86_64   sqlite-devel-3.7.17-8.el7.x86_64  The "attacker having the ability to run arbitrary SQL commands" concept seems a bit short sighted.  EL7 ships the sqlite-devel package, which means customers and users can build their own applications, which may or may not include the FTS3 module this bug occurs in.  The safest bet for customers is probably to back port the (fairly simple) upstream patch which fixes the problem, and release a SQLite 3.7.17-9. :)    <https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838>  Note - I'm not aware if anyone has (yet) looked for the earliest affected SQLite version, so see where the bug was introduced.  That would potentially be useful info too.  Thoughts?   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c30)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-01-02 15:22:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Justin Clift from [comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c27)) > As a data point, the Magellan vulnerability may be applicable to the sqlite > package in EL7 base too: >  >   sqlite-3.7.17-8.el7.x86_64 >   sqlite-devel-3.7.17-8.el7.x86_64 >  > The "attacker having the ability to run arbitrary SQL commands" concept > seems a bit short sighted. >  Analysis of these kind of flaws, normally assumes that standard security practices are followed. For example if you look at browsers chromium/chrome is only affected because it exposes a vector ie WebSQL.   > EL7 ships the sqlite-devel package, which means customers and users can > build their own applications, which may or may not include the FTS3 module > this bug occurs in. >  Again we assume that these applications are doing the right thing security wise. If insecure programming practices are followed, the underlying libraries cannot be blamed :)  > The safest bet for customers is probably to back port the (fairly simple) > upstream patch which fixes the problem, and release a SQLite 3.7.17-9. :) > See [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c29](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c29 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2018-20346 CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506 sqlite: Multiple flaws in sqlite which can be triggered via corrupted internal databases (Magellan)") . RHEL-7 isnt really affected.  Also if you look at the patch you mentioned below, it does not prevent corruption of internal databases, it just ensures that the corruption of databases cannot lead to arbitrary code execution.   >   <https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838> >  > Note - I'm not aware if anyone has (yet) looked for the earliest affected > SQLite version, so see where the bug was introduced.

I hope this answers your questions, feel free to open a support ticket if you are Red Hat customer!   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c31)  Nicholas Luedtke    2019-01-02 15:34:56 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2018-20346](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-20346).   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c32)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-01-04 07:03:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect the versions of sqlite package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7. This flaw in sqlite can be exploited by attackers only if they are able to run arbitrary SQL statements on the sqlite database.

sqlite: Upgrade to the 3.25.3 code in M72.

This CL pulls //third_party/sqlite from M72. The original sources in
//third_party/sqlite/sqlite-src-* were not changed, to avoid making the
diff even bigger than it already is.

This CL also pulls changes to //sql and //third_party/blink from the
following commits that landed in M72:

c6d3a866083891cf6cd935091ea877fa507d14a2
9a6c08e6e8436b8e1bae14a736a5db684287f939

The changes above are needed by the SQLite upgrade.

Tested: full debug build (compilation errors in tests were in unrelated
files), ran browser_tests, content_unittests, sql_unittests and the
LayoutTests in storage/websql/

There was a bug in FTS3 (not in the SQLite core) that allowed an SQL
Injection to escalate into a Remote Code Execution (RCE).  By making
malicious changes to the shadow tables that FTS3 uses and then running
FTS3 queries that used those tables, an integer overflow could cause a
buffer overrun, which if carefully managed might lead to an RCE.

This is only a problem for application that enable FTS3 (using the
SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 or SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4 compile-time options) and
which allow potential attackers to run arbitrary SQL.  Contrary to
published reports, there are probably *not* millions of application
that meet those circumstances.  In fact, I only know of one:  Chrome.
Chrome has FTS3 enabled, and allows arbitrary SQL through the WebSQL
interface.  On the other hand, Chrome only allows this within a
sandbox, so as far as I know, the problem did not lead to an exploit
even in Chrome.  Perhaps there were other techniques used for escaping
the sandbox after executing the RCE against FTS3, but if not then the
attack against Chrome was also benign, as far as I know.

I believe that Safari also enables WebSQL, but unless I am mistaken,
Safari has disabled FTS3 and so it is probably not vulnerable.

The Fossil Version Control System can be configured to allow anonymous
users to enter SQL to generate bug-report summaries.  However, that
SQL is very restricted.  Only SELECT statements are allowed, and they
are only allowed to access specific tables.  So Fossil is not
vulnerable.

I am not aware of any other applications that deliberately run SQL
from anonymous sources

In any application that enables FTS3 and also has an SQL Injection
bugs, the magellan problem allows those SQL Injection bugs to escalate
to an RCE bug.   And so, the FTS3 bug makes a preexisting SQL
Injection bug worse, but does not introduce any new bugs.

The bug in FTS3 was fixed in version 3.26.0.  So if you are using
SQLite 3.26.0, then you are not vulnerable to this RCE even if you do
enable FTS3 and do allow SQL Injections.

Our policy with respect to bugs is to try to not only fix the bug, but
also fix the process.  Hence, when this issue was discovered in FTS3,
we tried to figure out what we could have done differently from the
beginning to have prevented this bug in the first place, and what we
could do differently moving forward to prevent future similar bugs.
As part of that analysis, we came up with the new
SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option.  Applications that do deliberately
allow anonymously-sourced SQL can enable SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE to
prevent the SQL from deliberately corrupting the database file.  By
preventing corrupt database files, the attack surface is reduced.  Had
this option been available before Magellan, and had Chrome used it
(the latest Chrome releases *do* use it, I am told) then the Magellan
bug would have never happened.  But SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE is not
the "fix" for the bug.  It is defense-in-depth against similar future
bugs.

We are hard at work on additional defense-in-depth measures now.  I do
not know of any other exploits against FTS3 or SQLite or any other
common SQLite extensions.  But we are working to make sure no new ones
are discovered.

                 CVE-2020-13871
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sqlite3, a C library that
implements an SQL database engine.

CVE-2018-8740

    Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS statement
    could cause a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2018-20346

    When the FTS3 extension is enabled, sqlite3 encounters an integer
    overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries that occur
    after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run
    arbitrary SQL statements.

CVE-2018-20506

    When the FTS3 extension is enabled, sqlite3 encounters an integer
    overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a
    "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow
    tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
    leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements

CVE-2019-5827

    Integer overflow allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit
    heap corruption via a crafted HTML page, primarily impacting
    chromium.

CVE-2019-9936

    Running fts5 prefix queries inside a transaction could trigger a
    heap-based buffer over-read, which may lead to an information leak.

CVE-2019-9937

    Interleaving reads and writes in a single transaction with an fts5
    virtual table will lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference.

CVE-2019-16168

    A browser or other application can be triggered to crash because of
    inadequate parameter validation which could lead to a divide-by-zero
    error.

CVE-2019-20218

    WITH stack unwinding proceeds even after a parsing error, resulting
    in a possible application crash.

CVE-2020-13630

    The code related to the snippet feature exhibits a use-after-free
    defect.

CVE-2020-13632

    A crafted matchinfo() query can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-13871

    The parse tree rewrite for window functions is too late, leading to
    a use-after-free defect.

CVE-2020-11655

    An improper initialization of AggInfo objects allows attackers to
    cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a malformed
    window-function query.

CVE-2020-13434

    The code in sqlite3_str_vappendf in printf.c contains an integer
    overflow defect.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.2-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2633852.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2633852.1).

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[911706](https://crbug.com/911706)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## SQLite Release 3.25.3 On 2018-11-05

**Prior changes from version 3.25.0 (2018-09-15):**

1. Add support for [window functions](../windowfunctions.html)- Enhancements the [ALTER TABLE](../lang_altertable.html) command:
     1. Add support for renaming columns within a table using
        ALTER TABLE *table* RENAME COLUMN *oldname* TO *newname*.- Fix table rename feature so that it also updates references
          to the renamed table in [triggers](../lang_createtrigger.html) and [views](../lang_createview.html).- Query optimizer improvements:
       1. Avoid unnecessary loads of columns in an aggregate query that
          are not within an aggregate function and that are not part
          of the GROUP BY clause.- The IN-early-out optimization: When doing a look-up on a
            multi-column index and an IN operator is used on a column
            other than the left-most column, then if no rows match against
            the first IN value, check to make sure there exist rows that
            match the columns to the right before continuing with the
            next IN value.- Use the transitive property to try to propagate constant
              values within the WHERE clause. For example, convert
              "a=99 AND b=a" into "a=99 AND b=99".- Use a separate mutex on every inode in the unix [VFS](../vfs.html), rather than
         a single mutex shared among them all, for slightly better concurrency
         in multi-threaded environments.- Enhance the [PRAGMA integrity\_check](../pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check) command for improved detection
           of problems on the page freelist.- Output infinity as 1e999 in the ".dump" command of the
             [command-line shell](../cli.html).- Added the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_DATA\_VERSION](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntldataversion) file-control.- Added the [Geopoly module](../geopoly.html)

                 **Bug fixes:**- The ORDER BY LIMIT optimization might have caused an infinite loop
                   in the byte code of the prepared statement under very obscure
                   circumstances,
                   due to a confluence of minor defects in the query optimizer.
                   Fix for ticket
                   [9936b2fa443fec03ff25](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/9936b2fa443fec03ff25)- On an UPSERT when the order of constraint checks is rearranged,
                     ensure that the affinity transformations on the inserted content
                     occur before any of the constraint checks. Fix for ticket
                     [79cad5e4b2e219dd197242e9e](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/79cad5e4b2e219dd197242e9e).- Avoid using a prepared statement for ".stats on" command of the
                       [CLI](../cli.html) after it has been closed by the ".eqp full" logicc. Fix for ticket
                       [7be932dfa60a8a6b3b26bcf76](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/7be932dfa60a8a6b3b26bcf76).- The LIKE optimization was generating incorrect byte-code and hence
                         getting the wrong answer
                         if the left-hand operand has numeric affinity and the right-hand-side
                         pattern is '/%' or if the pattern begins with the ESCAPE character.
                         Fix for ticket
                         [c94369cae9b561b1f996d0054b](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/c94369cae9b561b1f996d0054b)

**Prior changes from version 3.25.1 (2018-09-18):**

1. Extra sanity checking added to ALTER TABLE in the 3.25.0 release
   sometimes raises a false-positive
   when the table being modified has a trigger that
   updates a virtual table. The false-positive caused the ALTER
   TABLE to rollback, thus leaving the schema unchanged.
   Ticket [b41031ea2b537237](https://sqlite.org/src/info/b41031ea2b537237).- The fix in the 3.25.0 release for the endless-loop in the byte-code
     associated with the ORDER BY LIMIT optimization did not work for
     some queries involving window functions. An additional correction
     is required. Ticket
     [510cde277783b5fb](https://sqlite.org/src/info/510cde277783b5fb)

**Prior changes from version 3.25.2 (2018-09-25):**

1. Add the [PRAGMA legacy\_alter\_table=ON](../pragma.html#pragma_legacy_alter_table) command that causes the
   "ALTER TABLE RENAME" command to behave as it did in SQLite versions 3.24.0
   and earlier: references to the renamed table inside the bodies of triggers
   and views are not updated. This new pragma provides a compatibility
   work around for older programs that expected the older, wonky behavior
   of ALTER TABLE RENAME.- Fix a problem with the new [window functions](../windowfunctions.html) implementation that caused
     a malfunction when complicated expressions involving window functions were used
     inside of a view.- Fixes for various other compiler warnings and minor problems associated
       with obscure configurations.

**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3.25.3 (2018-11-05):**

1. Disallow the use of [window functions](../windowfunctions.html) in the recursive part of
   a CTE. Ticket [e8275b415a2f03bee](https://sqlite.org/src/info/e8275b415a2f03bee)- Fix the behavior of typeof() and length() on virtual tables. Ticket
     [69d642332d25aa3b7315a6d385](https://sqlite.org/src/info/69d642332d25aa3b7315a6d385)- Strengthen defenses against deliberately corrupted database files.- Fix a problem in the query planner that results when a row-value expression
         is used with a PRIMARY KEY with redundant columns. Ticket
         [1a84668dcfdebaf12415d](https://sqlite.org/src/info/1a84668dcfdebaf12415d)- Fix the query planner so that it works correctly for IS NOT NULL operators
           in the ON clause of a LEFT JOIN with the SQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4 compile-time option.
           [65eb38f6e46de8c75e188a17ec](https://sqlite.org/src/info/65eb38f6e46de8c75e188a17ec)

           **Hashes:**- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: "2018-11-05 20:37:38 89e099fbe5e13c33e683bef07361231ca525b88f7907be7092058007b75036f2"- SHA3-256 for sqlite3.c: 45586e4df74de3a43f3a1f8c7a78c3c3f02edce01af7d10cafe68bb94476a5c5

CVE Name: CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505, CVE-2018-20506
For general information regarding FreeBSD Errata Notices and Security
Advisories, including descriptions of the fields above, security
branches, and the following sections, please visit
.
I. Background
SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. Programs that link the
SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS
process. The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access
program (sqlite3) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which
serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
II. Problem Description
According to https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index\_en.html, the
vulnerabilities known as Magellan are a group vulnerabilities that exist
in sqlite3, documented by CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505, and CVE-2018-20506.
When the FTS3 extension is enabled an integer overflow resulting in a buffer
overflow when allowing remote attackers to run arbitrary SQL statements which
can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.
III. Impact
The vulnerabilities were discovered by Tencent Blade Team and verified to be
able to successfully implement remote code execution in Chromium browsers.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
3) To update your system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# CVE-2018-20506

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-20505.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-20509.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-20506 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20506)

#### Description

SQLite before 3.25.3, when the FTS3 extension is enabled, encounters an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use cases). This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-20346.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-14 08:24:31 UTC  ``` Multiple flaws were found in sqlite. An attacker who is able to run arbitrary SQL statements could use this flaw to corrupt the internal databases, which can lead to arbitrary code execution as the user running sqlite.  This issue was fixed via sqlite-3.25.3 release at: <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_25_3.html>  Also sqlite-3.36 introduced SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option which when added to the config file, could prevent attackers for corrupting the internal database files. This could however break applications which require users to write these database files. <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_26_0.html> <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdefensive>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 03:25:09 UTC  ``` Created sqlite tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1659677](show_bug.cgi?id=1659677 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-20346 sqlite: Multiple flaws in sqlite which can be triggered via corrupted internal databases (Magellan) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c10)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 04:45:39 UTC  ``` Notes on exploitation:  The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements in order to corrupt the databases and run arbitrary code as the user running sqlite applications. This is uncommon in applications, normally only administrative users are allowed to run SQL statements.  Chromium however exposes sqlite via WebSQL.

EL7 ships the sqlite-devel package, which means customers and users can build their own applications, which may or may not include the FTS3 module this bug occurs in.

## SQLite Release 3.27.2 On 2019-02-25

**Prior changes from version 3.27.0 (2019-02-07):**

1. Added the [VACUUM INTO](../lang_vacuum.html#vacuuminto) command- Issue an SQLITE\_WARNING message on the [error log](../errlog.html) if a
     [double-quoted string literal](../quirks.html#dblquote) is used.- The [sqlite3\_normalized\_sql()](../c3ref/expanded_sql.html) interface works on any prepared statement
       created using [sqlite3\_prepare\_v2()](../c3ref/prepare.html) or [sqlite3\_prepare\_v3()](../c3ref/prepare.html). It is no
       longer necessary to use [sqlite3\_prepare\_v3()](../c3ref/prepare.html) with [SQLITE\_PREPARE\_NORMALIZE](../c3ref/c_prepare_dont_log.html#sqlitepreparenormalize)
       in order to use [sqlite3\_normalized\_sql()](../c3ref/expanded_sql.html).- Added the remove\_diacritics=2 option to [FTS3](../fts3.html) and [FTS5](../fts5.html).- Added the [SQLITE\_PREPARE\_NO\_VTAB](../c3ref/c_prepare_dont_log.html#sqlitepreparenovtab) option to [sqlite3\_prepare\_v3()](../c3ref/prepare.html).
           Use that option to prevent circular references to [shadow tables](../vtab.html#xshadowname) from
           causing resource leaks.- Enhancements to the [sqlite3\_deserialize()](../c3ref/deserialize.html) interface:
             1. Add the [SQLITE\_FCNTL\_SIZE\_LIMIT](../c3ref/c_fcntl_begin_atomic_write.html#sqlitefcntlsizelimit) [file-control](../c3ref/file_control.html) for
                setting an upper bound on the size of the in-memory database created
                by sqlite3\_deserialize. The default upper bound is 1GiB, or whatever
                alternative value is specified by
                [sqlite3\_config](../c3ref/config.html)([SQLITE\_CONFIG\_MEMDB\_MAXSIZE](../c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmemdbmaxsize))
                and/or [SQLITE\_MEMDB\_DEFAULT\_MAXSIZE](../compile.html#memdb_default_maxsize).- Honor the [SQLITE\_DESERIALIZE\_READONLY](../c3ref/c_deserialize_freeonclose.html) flag, which was previously described
                  in the documentation, but was previously a no-op.- Enhance the "deserialize" command of the [TCL Interface](../tclsqlite.html) to give it
                    new "--maxsize N" and "--readonly BOOLEAN" options.- Enhancements to the [CLI](../cli.html), mostly to support testing and debugging
               of the SQLite library itself:
               1. Add support for ".open --hexdb". The
                  "[dbtotxt](https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/tool/dbtotxt.md)" utility
                  program used to generate the text for the "hexdb" is added to the
                  source tree.- Add support for the "--maxsize N" option on ".open --deserialize".- Add the "--memtrace" command-line option, to show all memory allocations
                      and deallocations.- Add the ".eqp trace" option on builds with SQLITE\_DEBUG, to enable
                        bytecode program listing with indentation and
                        [PRAGMA vdbe\_trace](../pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace) all in one step.- Add the ".progress" command for accessing
                          the [sqlite3\_progress\_handler()](../c3ref/progress_handler.html) interface.- Add the "--async" option to the ".backup" command.- Add options "--expanded", "--normalized", "--plain", "--profile", "--row",
                              "--stmt", and "--close" to the ".trace" command.- Increased robustness against malicious SQL that is run against a
                 maliciously corrupted database.

                 **Bug fixes:**- Do not use a partial index to do a table scan on an IN operator.
                   Ticket [1d958d90596593a774](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/1d958d90596593a774).- Fix the [query flattener](../optoverview.html#flattening) so that it works on queries that contain
                     subqueries that use [window functions](../windowfunctions.html).
                     Ticket [709fcd17810f65f717](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/f09fcd17810f65f717)- Ensure that ALTER TABLE modifies table and column names embedded in WITH
                       clauses that are part of views and triggers.- Fix a parser bug that prevented the use of parentheses around table-valued
                         functions.- Fix a problem with the [OR optimization](../optoverview.html#or_opt) on [indexes on expressions](../expridx.html).
                           Ticket [d96eba87698a428c1d](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/d96eba87698a428c1d).- Fix a problem with the
                             [LEFT JOIN strength reduction optimization](../optoverview.html#leftjoinreduction) in which the optimization
                             was being applied inappropriately due to an IS NOT NULL operator.
                             Ticket [5948e09b8c415bc45d](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/5948e09b8c415bc45d).- Fix the [REPLACE](../lang_replace.html) command so that it is no longer able to sneak a
                               NULL value into a NOT NULL column even if the NOT NULL column has a default
                               value of NULL.
                               Ticket [e6f1f2e34dceeb1ed6](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/e6f1f2e34dceeb1ed6)- Fix a problem with the use of [window functions](../windowfunctions.html) used within
                                 [correlated subqueries](../lang_expr.html#cosub).
                                 Ticket [d0866b26f83e9c55e3](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/d0866b26f83e9c55e3)- Fix the [ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN](../lang_altertable.html#altertabmvcol) command so that it works for tables
                                   that have redundant UNIQUE constraints.
                                   Ticket [bc8d94f0fbd633fd9a](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/bc8d94f0fbd633fd9a)- Fix a bug that caused [zeroblob](../lang_corefunc.html#zeroblob) values to be truncated when inserted into
                                     a table that uses an [expression index](../expridx.html).
                                     Ticket [bb4bdb9f7f654b0bb9](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/bb4bdb9f7f654b0bb9)

**Prior changes from version 3.27.1 (2019-02-08):**

1. Fix a bug in the query optimizer: an adverse interaction between
   the [OR optimization](../optoverview.html#or_opt) and the optimization that tries to use values
   read directly from an [expression index](../expridx.html) instead of recomputing the
   expression.
   Ticket [4e8e4857d32d401f](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/4e8e4857d32d401f)

**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3.27.2 (2019-02-25):**

# Crash Chrome 70 with the SQLite Magellan bug

Dec 14, 2018

This proof-of-concept crashes the Chrome renderer process using [Tencent Blade Team's Magellan SQLite3 bug](https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html). It's based on [a SQLite test case](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838) from the commit that fixed the bug.

If you're using Chrome 70 or below, tap the button below to crash this page:

This includes Chromium, because Chromium ships with WebSQL. The Google Home is probably vulnerable because it can be coerced to load a webpage. I doubt that this bug affects systems that merely use SQLite as a database without providing external query access. My best guess for the bug is that arbitrary SQLite queries, prior to 3.26.0, were permitted to write to the shadow tables used by various plugins to implement features. fts3/4, prior to 3.25.3, appear to contain an integer overflow bug which can be triggered by manually modifying the fts index data. A careful application of this integer overflow appears to make it possible to truncate a writable buffer, leading to a nice heap overflow condition that can be exploited by further crafted SQL queries. The primary integer overflow bug was fixed in <https://sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838> "Add extra defenses against strategically corrupt databases to fts3/4.", committed as part of the 3.25.3 update (which is what Chromium updated to). Later, in 3.26.0, they further secure it by making shadow tables *optionally* read-only. The worrying thing here is that SQLite3, in its default configuration, is still not convincingly secure. Being able to write arbitrary data to the shadow tables has the potential to break all sorts of assumed invariants, and it's pretty clear that the SQLite3 developers did not necessarily anticipate all the ways in which this could break. The "SQLITE\_DBCONFIG\_DEFENSIVE" option which was added does not appear to be on by default, and it breaks backwards compatibility (setting it causes SQL imports from .dump to fail because .dump assumes shadow tables are writable during import). There may be more bugs lurking in this area - this would be an *excellent* opportunity to fuzz all the plugins in SQLite to see if any of them barf when their shadow tables are corrupted. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [SQLite](user?id=SQLite) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18686462)   | [parent](#18686305) | [next](#18686456) [–]  Excellent summary, nneonneo. I think everything you said here is correct. The vulnerability only exists in applications that allow a potential attacker to run arbitrary SQL. If an application allows that, it is usually called an "SQL Injection" vulnerability and is the fault of the application, not the database engine. The one notable exception to this rule is WebSQL in Chrome. I put up <https://www.sqlite.org/security.html> recently to serve as guidance for people who want to live on the edge and give unrestricted SQL access (or unrestricted database file access) to potentially hostile attackers. That page is a work in progress. More could be said. For example, it is probably also a good idea to use various obscure APIs to limit the length of SQL statements or the amount of memory that can be used, to avoid DOS attacks. I'll keep improving the document as I have time. Our intent is that SQLite *should* be secure against these kinds of attacks. We have spent years fuzzing it to try to find these problems. But the thing is, we never configured a fuzzer in such a way that it might start modifying the shadow tables of FTS3, and so we missed this one. Moral: never underestimate the ingenuity of a motivated gray-hat. The Chrome people have recently starting fuzzing SQLite database files on Google's infrastructure. We had previously only fuzzed database files on our own workstations. It's amazing the number of new problems you can find when you run a fuzzer at scale. :-) A few more problems have been fixed. We are not aware of any exploits. And in particular, if you follow the advice of the article above and "PRAGMA quick\_check" untrusted database files or set "PRAGMA cell\_size\_check=ON" then none of the recently found and fixed issues are reachable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kd5bjo](user?id=kd5bjo) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687470)   | [root](#18686305) | [parent](#18686462) | [next](#18687508) [–]  If giving unrestricted database file access is “living on the edge,” maybe <https://www.sqlite.org/appfileformat.html> should be updated to reflect that? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zzo38computer](user?id=zzo38computer) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687513)   | [root](#18686305) | [parent](#18687470) | [next](#18687508) [–]  I agree. If the file is one you might get elsewhere rather than only being your own files, then it is untrusted. To me, "trusted" is: queries entered by the local user (or, for setuid programs, by the local system administrator instead of the local user), or that are built in to the program. Others are untrusted. And yet, I have already considered these kind of vulnerability before even knowing about it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [weinzierl](user?id=weinzierl) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687508)   | [root](#18686305) | [parent](#18686462) | [prev](#18687470) | [next](#18686456) [–]  What about Fossil? Is there a way for a potential attacker to run arbitrary SQL? I can't think of one but I'm only a light user. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zzo38computer](user?id=zzo38computer) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687515)   | [root](#18686305) | [parent](#18687508) | [next](#18686456) [–]  I think it depends on the permissions. If you do not allow users with those permissions to login remotely, then I would suppose it would not be a problem. (This is what I do: users with permission to enter SQL and TH1 codes cannot login remotely.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18686456)   | [parent](#18686305) | [prev](#18686462) | [next](#18687889) [–]  A nit: it's not necessarily just applications that accept arbitrary queries, but also applications that use sqlite as a file format. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nneonneo](user?id=nneonneo) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18686667)   | [root](#18686305) | [parent](#18686456) | [next](#18687889) [–]  Yes - good point. Programs accepting SQLite databases as input (as opposed to just queries) are also vulnerable. The exploit is probably somewhat harder if you don’t have interactivity, since it would depend on exactly how the corrupt database gets used. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [IshKebab](user?id=IshKebab) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687889)   | [parent](#18686305) | [prev](#18686456) | [next](#18685748) [–]  Are you sure Google Home loads web pages?

It has seven times more test code than non-test code. 100% branch coverage. If even SQLite can have a RCE vulnerability, I'm convinced that it is not feasible for *anybody* to write safe C code.

It's about logical coverage. What are you testing for? You are not testing lines of code, but logic. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SQLite](user?id=SQLite) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18686695)   | [root](#18685748) | [parent](#18685816) | [next](#18686833) [–]  Right. The actual standard is called "modified condition/decison coverage" or MC/DC. In languages like C, MC/DC and branch coverage, though not exactly the same, are very close. Achieving 100% MC/DC does not prove that you always get the right answer. All it means is that your tests are so extensive that you managed to get every machine-code branch to go in both directions at least once. It is a high standard and is difficult to achieve. It does not mean that the software is perfect. But it does help. A lot. When I was young, I used to think I could right flawless code. Then I wrote SQLite, and it got picked up and used by lots of applications. It will amaze you how many problems will crop up when your code runs on in millions of application on billions of devices. I was getting a steady stream of bug reports against SQLite. Then I took 10 months (2008-09-25 through 2009-07-25) to write the 100% MC/DC tests for SQLite. And after that, the number of bug reports slowed to a trickle. There still are bugs. But the number of bugs is greatly reduced. (Note that 100% MC/DC was first obtained on 2009-07-25, but the work did not end there. I spend most of my development time adding and enhancing test cases to keep up with changes in the deliverable SQLite code.) 100% MC/DC is just an arbitrary threshold - a high threshold and one that is easy to measure and difficult to cheat - but it is just a threshold at which we say "enough". You could just as easily choose a different threshold, such as 100% line coverage. The higher the threshold, the fewer bugs will slip through. But there will always be bugs. My experience is that the weird tests you end up having to write just to cause some obscure branch to go one way or another end up finding problems in totally unrelated parts of the system. One of the chief benefits of 100% MC/DC is not so much that every branch is tested, but rather that you have to write so many tests, and such strange, weird, convoluted, and stressful tests, that you randomly stumble across (and fix) lots of problems you would have never thought about otherwise. Another big advantage of 100% MC/DC is that once they are in place, you can change anything, anywhere in the code, and if the tests all still pass, you have high confidence that you didn't break anything. This enables us to evolve the SQLite code much faster than we could otherwise, using relatively few eyeballs. Yet another advantage of 100% MC/DC is that you are really testing compiled machine code, not source code. So you worry less about compiler bugs. "Undefined behavior" is a big bugbear with C. We worry less than others about UB because we have tested the output of the compiler and we know that the compiler did what we wanted, even if the official C-language spec didn't require it to. We still avoid UB, and SQLite does not currently contain any UB as far as we know. But is is nice to know that even if we missed some UB in the code someplace, it probably doesn't matter. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Drdrdrq](user?id=Drdrdrq) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18688281)   | [root](#18685748) | [parent](#18686695) | [next](#18688524) [–]  Nicely written, and thank you for providing such a great peice of engineering!

If there is a logical dependency between the state checked by one if-statement and the state checked by another one, your perfect coverage may not pick up on that.

I would never argue they aren't, but by this logic ("it's like saying PDF or JPEG parsers can't be vulnerable to RCE") virtually every code execution vuln in a library can be called RCE. I haven't noticed this to be the case with e.g. libtiff vulnerabilities (of which many make it into my inbox regularly), although image libraries are one of the cases were CE = RCE is still fairly reasonable. Let's assume this SQLite bug is only exploitable if you can input arbitrary SQL. Almost no applications use it this way (except Chrome).

The first node in the chain is delivering malicious SQL. The second node is executing code remotely via SQLite. The proof is that SQLite or the application linking it could have mitigated this attack independently by either filtering the query string or better protecting the memory which is being written to. In practice, however, the community gets more bang for their buck if they label the SQLite code execution vulnerability as an RCE since the vast majority of use is in a networked setting. You have to remember the audience used for these terms.

When something binds to localhost, there's still potential for privilege escalation vulnerability, since any process can connect to the port - so if there's an exploit, a low-privileged process could hijack a higher-privileged one. Localhost sockets are still a security boundary. Since SQLite in and of itself is just a library, it doesn't have that problem.

Which is highly suggestive that the problem is that ordinary SQL is able to write to internal virtual tables in a way that corrupts the database. And presumably from there, once you can introduce corruption you can get it to exploit a payload that you provide. The fact that Chromium also saw fit to patch this suggests further that there was likely some way that it could be tricked into issuing queries that did this, allowing some compromise of the browser. If this could have been triggered by a web page, then that explains why they are light on details. It should be noted that a *lot* of applications embed SQLite internally. If one as well studied as Chromium could be tricked in this way, I'm sure that others can as well. And since the upgrade has to happen to an embedded component, we're probably going to hear about this one for a while. Please note, this is all educated guesswork from knowing the software ecosystem and reading release notes.

Since Sqlite suggests use cases that require loading untrusted databases, this is a bug in its own right. Then, the rest is "to be safe" measures, because it was possible for carefully crafted SQL to intentionally corrupt the database in controllable ways, including triggering the former bug.

It shows that ridiculous amounts of testing with 100% coverage of every code path and "millions and millions" of test cases still doesn't guarantee that the program always works as intended. I think that this is an important lesson about testing. We should have fewer tests but we should try to get the most value possible out of each one and for developers that means actively seeking out unusual edge cases that are likely to break things.

Fuzz testing is better for finding vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a hacker. The 100% MC/DC testing in SQLite is very useful in ensuring that the code does what is intended for sane inputs. And 100% MC/DC helps prevent us from breaking things as we evolve and enhance the code. But the MC/DC testing is less useful at fending off attackers. (2) The magellan vulnerability exploits a bug in an SQLite extension, FTS3, which while very well tested, is not testing to 100% MC/DC. (See the second sentence at <https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html#test_coverage>) Hence my takeaways from this episode include that I need to extend 100% MC/DC testing to all commonly used extensions in SQLite, including FTS3, FTS5, and RTREE, and I need to improve fuzz testing throughout SQLite but especially in extensions. Advocates of "safe" language correctly observe that this particular problem would not have happened if SQLite were written in (say) Rust. Rewriting SQLite in Rust in not (yet) a viable solution. (See <https://www.sqlite.org/whyc.html>) But I can start moving SQLite in that direction, and perhaps make use of techniques taken from safe languages to improve its resistance to attack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mwhicks1](user?id=mwhicks1) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18689885)   | [root](#18687683) | [parent](#18687955) | [next](#18687109) [–]  Hopefully soon, “moving in that direction” can be done by slowly porting to Checked C, while always retaining an executable artifact. <https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sat\_nam](user?id=sat_nam) [on Dec 15, 2018](item?id=18687109)   | [prev](#18687683) | [next](#18685566) [–]  Zhuowei Zhang (@zhuowei) published a proof of concept that crashes Chrome 70: <https://worthdoingbadly.com/sqlitebug/> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [simonw](user?id=simonw) [on Dec 14, 2018](item?id=18685566)   | [prev](#18687109) | [next](#18685510) [–]  Python ships with a sqlite3 module in the standard library.

Hard to tell anything without more details though. But if that is the case this is *huge*.

I see chromium, in their patch, switched to using new flags when opening the DB. There are also some sqlite changes that seem to prevent meddling with virtual table shadow tables (eg inverted index for the fts3 extension).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131576#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-04-04 14:48:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-20506  SQLite before 3.25.3, when the FTS3 extension is enabled, encounters an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use cases). This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-20346.

Package        : sqlite3
Version        : 3.8.7.1-1+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20346

Security experts at Tencent’s Blade security team have discovered a
critical vulnerability in SQLite database software (nicknamed "Magellan").

The "Magellan" remote code execution vulnerability has now been fixed by
adding extra defenses against strategically corrupt databases to fts3/4.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.8.7.1-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2018-12-14 08:24:31 UTC  ``` Multiple flaws were found in sqlite. An attacker who is able to run arbitrary SQL statements could use this flaw to corrupt the internal databases, which can lead to arbitrary code execution as the user running sqlite.  This issue was fixed via sqlite-3.25.3 release at: <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_25_3.html>  Also sqlite-3.36 introduced SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option which when added to the config file, could prevent attackers for corrupting the internal database files. This could however break applications which require users to write these database files. <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_26_0.html> <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_dbconfig_defensive.html#sqlitedbconfigdefensive>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1659379#c8)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2018-12-15 04:45:39 UTC  ``` Notes on exploitation:  The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements in order to corrupt the databases and run arbitrary code as the user running sqlite applications. This is uncommon in applications, normally only administrative users are allowed to run SQL statements.  Chromium however exposes sqlite via WebSQL. This issue was address by Chromium 71.0.3578.80 via [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3803](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3803)  Mozilla firefox uses sqlite only to store internal profile information, browsing history etc, therefore should not be exploitable remotely.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1119687#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2018-12-17 09:42:36 UTC  ``` <https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html>  A remote code execution vulnerability was reported to exist in SQLite by Tencent Blade Team. Labeled Magellan.   The effects are said to be RCE, including leakage of program privileged information or DoS. Reportedly, the vector includes interfaces that accept arbitrary SQLite3 queries, in particular WebSQL style. Bug is that arbitrary queries can write to shadow tables. Integer overflow fixed in <https://sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838> (3.25.3) "Add extra defenses against strategically corrupt databases to fts3/4. "  In 3.26.0, shadow tables are optionally read-only: "Added support for read-only shadow tables when the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE option is enabled."  Apparently already fixed in Chromium ([bug 1118529](show_bug.cgi?id=1118529 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: chromium: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 71.0.3578.80")) [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/c368e30ae55600a1c3c9cb1710a54f9c55de786e](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/c368e30ae55600a1c3c9cb1710a54f9c55de786e)   References: <https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html> <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18686305> <https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_26_0.html> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1119687#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-27 11:58:44 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1120335](show_bug.cgi?id=1120335 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - VUL-0: CVE-2018-20346: sqlite3,sqlite2,sqlite: sqlite: integer overflow (resulting in buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1119687#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2018-12-27 12:02:59 UTC  ``` sqlite2 is not affected, does not contain the code. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1119687#c5)  Sofia Syrianidou   2019-01-02 08:39:45 UTC  ``` Happy new year everyone,  From what I can see on SLE 11 SP4 and SLE 12 SP3 patched servers, they have sqlite3 installed, just old version.

Otherwise, you are not at risk."
