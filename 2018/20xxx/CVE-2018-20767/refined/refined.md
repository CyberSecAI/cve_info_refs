The provided document is a Xerox mini-bulletin detailing security fixes in SPAR releases for various WorkCentre and Phaser printer models. While the bulletin lists numerous vulnerabilities, **it does NOT mention CVE-2018-20767 specifically.**

Here's a breakdown of the security issues addressed in the bulletin:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTTP Security Header Not Detected:** This indicates a lack of proper HTTP security headers, potentially leaving the device vulnerable to various attacks.
*   **HTTP Header Missing:** Similar to the above, missing HTTP headers can lead to security weaknesses.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the device's file system.
*   **Remote Command Execution (authenticated):** This permits an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
*   **Remote Command Execution (unauthenticated):**  This permits an *unauthenticated* attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device. This is a critical vulnerability.
*  **Writable file to Execute PHP code**: This suggests that an attacker could write a PHP file to a location where it is then executed by the device, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
*  **Blind SQL Injection**:  This could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive data, modify data or execute arbitrary code within the database.
*   **Cross-frame scripting (XFS):** A type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the way web browsers handle frames, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into a frame.
*   **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP):** An attack technique that exploits the way web applications handle HTTP parameters, potentially allowing for bypassing security checks, or other malicious activity.
*   **Weak SSL certificate:** The use of a weak SSL certificate weakens the security of encrypted communications, leaving the device vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **SSL Certificate Hostname Discrepancy:** A mismatch between the hostname in the SSL certificate and the hostname used to access the device can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Root Cause (inferred):**
The root causes of these vulnerabilities appear to stem from a combination of insecure coding practices, insufficient input validation, and improper configuration of the web server and other services on the printer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities could range from:

*   Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the device.
*   Full compromise of the device through remote command execution.
*   Manipulation of device functions.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors for these vulnerabilities include:
* Sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious parameters.
* Sending crafted HTTP requests to access arbitrary local files on the device
* Sending crafted SQL queries.
* Attempting to execute commands on the device's operating system through web interfaces.
* Man-in-the-middle attacks targeting the device's SSL/TLS connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* For some vulnerabilities, like unauthenticated remote command execution, an attacker might not need any authentication or special access.
* For other vulnerabilities, like authenticated remote command execution, an attacker would need valid credentials.
* For network-based attacks, the attacker would need to be on the same network or have network access to the device.

**Summary:**
While this document details numerous serious vulnerabilities, it does not reference CVE-2018-20767. Therefore, the answer is:
