The provided content from Exploit Database details multiple vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4. While the content does not directly refer to CVE-2018-20793, it provides extensive information about several security flaws in the specified software version.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (`get_file` action):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `get_file` action in `ajax_calls.php` is vulnerable to path traversal through the `path` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `path` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `action=get_file`, `sub_action=edit`, and `preview_mode=text` parameters and a crafted `path` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**2. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (`copy_cut` and `paste_clipboard` actions):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Path traversal vulnerability in `copy_cut` action in `ajax_calls.php` combined with `paste_clipboard` action in `execute.php`.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the `path` parameter in `copy_cut` action, and reliance on session data in `paste_clipboard` action.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by first copying a file through path traversal, and then pasting it into the upload directory.
*  **Attack Vector:** Two steps: 1) send a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with `action=copy_cut` and a crafted `path` parameter to copy the file. 2) Send a POST request to `execute.php` with `action=paste_clipboard` to paste the file into the upload directory.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**3. Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (`create_file` action):**

*   **Root Cause:** Mitigation for directory traversal is bypassed by using an array in `paths` parameter in `execute.php`.
*   **Weakness:**  Insufficient validation of the structure of the `paths` parameter and the file path passed within it, and allows an array instead of string.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the server by using an array structure in `paths` and `names` parameters.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Send a POST request to `execute.php` with `action=create_file` and craft `paths` and `names` parameters as arrays with directory traversal sequence and filename.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (`delete_file` action):**

*   **Root Cause:** Mitigation for directory traversal is bypassed by using an array in `paths` parameter in `execute.php`.
*   **Weakness:**  Insufficient validation of the structure of the `paths` parameter and the file path passed within it, and allows an array instead of string.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files by using an array structure in `paths` parameter with directory traversal sequences.
*  **Attack Vector:** Send a POST request to `execute.php` with `action=delete_file` and a crafted array structure in the `paths` parameter containing a directory traversal sequence and the path to a file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**5. Arbitrary Directory Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (`delete_folder` action):**

*   **Root Cause:** Mitigation for directory traversal is bypassed by using an array in `paths` parameter in `execute.php`.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of the structure of the `paths` parameter and the directory path passed within it.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary directories by using an array structure in `paths` parameter with directory traversal sequences.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Send a POST request to `execute.php` with `action=delete_folder` and a crafted array in the `paths` parameter with directory traversal sequences and the directory path.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**6. Arbitrary File Write with Image Extension (`save_img` action):**

*  **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation of the `path` parameter and the url provided in the request, combined with allowing the attacker to specify the file name.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization of the `path` and `name` parameters.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary image files with jpg/jpeg/png extensions to the specified location.
*   **Attack Vector:** Send a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with `action=save_img` , provide `path`, `name` and a `url` containing a valid image path.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the path to the file manager instance.

**7. Persistent XSS in `media_preview` Action:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize the filename when it's used in media preview.
*   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of filenames when displayed in the media preview.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the filename of a media file, which executes when another user previews that file.
*   **Attack Vector:** Upload a file with a media extension (e.g., .mp3) with an XSS payload in its name, for example: `a"%2balert(document.cookie)%2b".mp3`. When previewed, the XSS payload will execute.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the vulnerable server and have other users preview those files.
