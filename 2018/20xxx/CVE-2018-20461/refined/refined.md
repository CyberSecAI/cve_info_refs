Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20461.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `core_anal_bytes` function within `libr/core/cmd_anal.c`. Specifically, the crash occurs at line 1572 due to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer. The issue arises within a loop where the code accesses `buf[j + idx]`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The crash occurs due to an invalid memory access, leading to the termination of the `r2` process. This could potentially be leveraged for more severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `r2` command-line interface by executing the following commands sequentially: `bd` followed by `ao`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to run `r2` with a target file and execute commands in the REPL. No specific privileges are needed, as the crash can be triggered by a regular user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was found using AddressSanitizer (ASan), a memory error detector.
- The issue was not limited to arm/arm64 binaries but also affected other architectures such as x86\_64.
- The provided patch modified line 1572 to access the buffer within the correct bounds by calculating `ch` based on a conditional statement to avoid out of bound reads during printing.
