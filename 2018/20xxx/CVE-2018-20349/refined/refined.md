Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20349:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `igraph_i_strdiff` function in the igraph library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The `igraph_i_strdiff` function does not properly handle a NULL pointer passed as the `key` argument, which leads to a dereference and a crash. Specifically, the code `while (key[diff] != '\0' && ...)` accesses memory at the address pointed to by key without checking if key is NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) and termination of the application using the igraph library. This effectively causes a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input to the `igraph_read_graph_graphml` function, specifically in the graphml parsing logic. The provided example `igraph_trie-igraph_i_strdiff-112.crash` shows this with a specially crafted file, which leads to the `key` argument being NULL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide crafted input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a specifically crafted GraphML input file to an application that uses the vulnerable igraph library through `igraph_read_graph_graphml`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the following code within `igraph_trie.c`:
```c
long int igraph_i_strdiff(const char *str, const char *key) {
    long int diff=0;
    while (key[diff] != '\0' && str[diff] != '\0' && str[diff]==key[diff]) {
        diff++;
    }
    return diff;
}
```
- The backtrace from GDB shows that a NULL `key` is passed to `igraph_i_strdiff` due to a prior call to  `igraph_trie_get_node` and ultimately caused by an issue within the graphml parsing logic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in igraph version 0.7.1-12.
- The fix was backported to multiple Fedora versions (29, 30 and EPEL 7), as well as Debian 8 ("Jessie").
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a GraphML file, specifically within the attribute processing.
- The fix likely involves adding a check for a NULL `key` before dereferencing it in `igraph_i_strdiff`.

This is more detailed than the official CVE description, which only mentions a NULL pointer dereference leading to a denial of service.
