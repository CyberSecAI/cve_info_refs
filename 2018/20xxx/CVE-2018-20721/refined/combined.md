 \* Fixed: Multiple issues with IPv6 and IPvFuture literal parsing (GitHub #146, GitHub #150) Thanks to Scallop Ye for the report and the pull request! \* Fixed: Fix symbol visibility for -DBUILD\_SHARED\_LIBS=OFF (GitHub #139, GitHub #141); thanks to Mariusz Zaborski for the report! \* Fixed: For MinGW, use size\_t for inet\_ntop declaration and fix macro checks for both MinGW and mingw-w64 (GitHub #131) \* Fixed: Compiler warnings (GitHub #132, GitHub #152) \* Improved: Use name UriConfig.h rather than generic config.h for the config header file to avoid name clashes and also include it through "UriConfig.h" with quotes rather than <UriConfig.h> so that it is found in quote path locations (GitHub #149) Thanks to Gaspard Petit for bringing this up! \* Improved: Document need for UriConfig.h in UriMemory.c (GitHub #136) \* Infrastructure: Add (support for) Visual Studio 17/2022 (GitHub #152) \* Infrastructure: Drop (support for) Visual Studio <=14/2015 (GitHub #152) \* Infrastructure: Update Clang from 13 to 15 (GitHub #143, GitHub #151) \* Infrastructure: Make MinGW with 32bit Wine on Ubuntu 20.04 possible (GitHub #142, GitHub #144, GitHub #145) \* Soname: 1:30:0 — see https://verbump.de/ for what these numbers do
2022-01-06 -- 0.9.6
>>>>>>>>>>>>> SECURITY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> \* Fixed: [CVE-2021-46141] Fix a bug affecting both uriNormalizeSyntax\* and uriMakeOwner\* functions where the text range in .hostText would not be duped using malloc but remain unchanged (and hence "not owned") for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address hostname; depending on how an application uses uriparser, this could lead the application into a use-after-free situation. As the second half, fix uriFreeUriMembers\* functions that would not free .hostText memory for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address host; also, calling uriFreeUriMembers\* multiple times on a URI of this very nature would result in trying to free pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory (GitHub #121, GitHub #124) Commit 987b046e41f407d17c622e580fc82a5e834b4329 Commit b1a34743bc1472e055d886e29e9b53f670eb3282 \* Fixed: [CVE-2021-46142] Fix functions uriNormalizeSyntax\* for out-of-memory situations (i.e. malloc returning NULL) for URIs containing empty segments (any of user info, host text, query, or fragment) where previously pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory were freed (GitHub #122, GitHub #124) Commit c0483990e6b5b454f7c8752b36760cfcb0d093f5>>>>>>>>>>>>> SECURITY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> \* Fixed: CMake: Call "enable\_language(CXX)" prior to tinkering with CMAKE\_CXX\_\* variables (GitHub #110) Thanks to Alexander Richardson for the patch (originally at libexpat) \* Fixed: CMake: Support absolute paths for both CMAKE\_INSTALL\_LIBDIR and CMAKE\_INSTALL\_INCLUDEDIR (GitHub #114) Thanks to Rafael Fontenelle for bringing this up (originally at libexpat) \* Fixed: Windows: Address MSVC compiler warnings (GitHub #111, GitHub #113) \* Fixed: Documentation: Space requirements for uriUriStringToUnixFilename did not take into account short form "file:/bin/bash" of RFC 8089 of 2017 (with prefix "file:/" rather than "file:///") that uriparser supports since release 0.8.6 in 2018 (GitHub #118, GitHub #119) \* Fixed: Compile error with MinGW GCC 9 related to a mismatched prototype for function inet\_ntop (GitHub #117, GitHub #120) Thanks to Sandro Mani for the report! \* Fixed: Compile warnings in test suite code (GitHub #120) \* Improved: Respect variable ${CPP} in doc/preprocess.sh (GitHub #115) \* Added: Test suite invocation for MinGW using Wine (GitHub #120) \* Soname: 1:29:0 — see https://verbump.de/ for what these numbers do
2021-03-18 -- 0.9.5
 \* Fixed: Fix a bug regarding section "5.2.4. Remove Dot Segments" of RFC 3986 that affected both normalization and reference resolution with regard to trailing slashes (GitHub #92, #97) Thanks to Dan Pape for the report! \* Fixed: MinGW: Fix name of static library (GitHub #90) Thanks to SpaceIm for the patch and Sandro Mani for review! \* Fixed: Use correct inline marker "\_\_forceinline" for Intel C++ Compiler (GitHub #93) Thanks to jensenrichardson for the patch! \* Fixed: Link against pthreads for (default) -DURIPARSER\_BUILD\_TESTS=ON (GitHub #99, #100) \* Fixed: When integrated using CMake function add\_subdirectory, installation could fail due to lack of prefix ${CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR} (GitHub #98) Thanks for the patch to Shehzan Mohammed! \* Fixed: Addressed MSVC compile warning about lack of /EHsc when compiling the C++ test suite code (GitHub #102) \* Fixed: Stopped misadvertising wide characters as Unicode support (GitHub #104) \* Added: CMake option URIPARSER\_WARNINGS\_AS\_ERRORS=(ON|OFF) to turn compile warnings into errors, defaults to "OFF" (GitHub #102) \* Improved: pkg-config: Use ${prefix} and ${exec\_prefix} to ease overriding variables using --define-variable=NAME=VALUE, e.g. as done on OpenWRT (GitHub #91) Thanks to Karel Kočí for the pull request! \* Improved: Auto-detection of the qhelpgenerator command based on CMake package "Qt5Help" when available. CMake option "QHG\_LOCATION" can still be used to enforce a specific location (GitHub #103) Thanks for his help to Andreas Sturmlechner! \* Improved: Make documentation use pkg-config in example on how to check for uriparser from within configure.ac (GNU Autoconf) (GitHub #37, #106) \* Improved: In testing code, add a missing 'extern "C"' (GitHub #109) Thanks to Jørgen Ibsen for the patch! \* Soname: 1:28:0 — see https://verbump.de/ for what these numbers do

(GitHub #69) \* Added: Functions to make UriUri[AW] instances independent of the original URI string (GitHub #77 and #78) New functions: uriMakeOwner[AW] uriMakeOwnerMm[AW] \* Added: CMake option URIPARSER\_ENABLE\_INSTALL to toggle installation of files, defaults to "ON" (GitHub #74, #75) Thanks to Scott Donelan for the patch! \* Soname: 1:27:0

2008-09-01 -- 0.7.2
 \* Fixed: Bad cleanup logic in functions - uriAddBaseUri(..) - uriRemoveBaseUri(..) Previously you needed to call uriFreeUriMembers on return code URI\_ERROR\_MALLOC and only then. So that's why these functions now take cleanup off your shoulders. An extra call to uriFreeUriMembers from your side is still needed in case of success. \* Soname: 1:7:0
2008-04-27 -- 0.7.1
 \* Fixed: Bogus syntax error when parsing URIs with port-like passwords, e.g. "http://user:21@host/" (SF.net bug #1) Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for reporting! \* Fixed: Parser did not handle trailing slashes correctly in some cases, which also made the structures produced from parsing "http://e.com/" and "http://e.com" indistinguishable. (SF.net bug #2) Thanks to Edward Z. Yang for reporting!
2008-04-04 -- 0.7.0
 \* Added: Dissection and composition of query strings \* Added: Documentation improvements (in|out|inout indicators, addition of \since and \see) \* Changed: Code::Blocks project files updated from file format version 1.4 to 1.6, which is produced by Code::Blocks 8.02 \* Added: Code::Blocks workspace file \* Soname: 1:5:0

This is a whole in RFC 3986, see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.
2007-08-09 -- 0.5.1
 \* Fixed: Empty host bug (URIs like "///g") \* Fixed: Relative URIs are no longer touched by normalization \* Fixed: MergePath failed for empty paths \* Fixed: Bug with "." segments in AddBase All of the above revealed by test cases from 4Suite (http://4suite.org/)

2007-04-23 -- 0.3.4
 \* Added: Shared library support (moved to libtool)
2007-04-03 -- 0.3.3
 \* Fixed: Now unix EOLs constantly \* Fixed: Added forgotten files to release package
2007-03-31 -- 0.3.2
 \* Fixed: Now compiles on FreeBSD

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
