Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read that occurs during the parsing of incomplete URIs containing IPv6 addresses with an embedded IPv4 address. This happens in the `uriParse*Ex*` functions of the `uriparser` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The parsing logic attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer when encountering an incomplete IPv6 address with an embedded IPv4 address (e.g., `//[::44.1`). Specifically, when parsing the embedded IPv4 part, the code doesn't check if there are enough bytes available before attempting to read them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash or unpredictable behavior:** An out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the application using the `uriparser` library or other unpredictable behavior due to accessing memory that is not intended to be read, potentially allowing for further exploitation.
- **Denial of service:** The crash can cause the application to become unavailable, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious or malformed URI:** An attacker can craft a URI containing an incomplete IPv6 address with an embedded IPv4 address to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- **Input processing:**  The vulnerability exists when the `uriparser` library is used to parse a URI that could come from various sources such as user input, network traffic, or configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malformed URI to an application using a vulnerable version of `uriparser` and trigger the parsing of this URI.
- There is no need to have direct access to the system if the vulnerable component is part of a service that can be accessed remotely.

**Additional Information**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check in the parsing logic to ensure that the code doesn't read beyond the allocated memory when processing IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4 addresses.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated if the passed parameter `afterLast` points to readable memory containing a `\0` byte. This is because the parsing function will stop when it reaches this null byte, preventing it from reading past the end of the buffer.
*   This vulnerability was reported by Joergen Ibsen.
*   Debian LTS security advisories DLA-1682-1 and DLA-2834-1 addressed this CVE for Debian 8 "Jessie" and Debian 9 "Stretch" respectively.
