Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20378

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a state machine bug in Blue SDK's L2CAP implementation, specifically how it handles the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) option during configuration requests. An attacker can send a configuration request with an invalid MTU value, which is stored before validation. Subsequent valid requests can cause the channel to be marked as valid while still retaining the invalid MTU.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Integer Underflow:** When an invalid MTU value (less than 9) is used by the SDP server, an integer underflow occurs in the calculation of the buffer size, which is used when preparing the response, resulting in a very large size being passed to a function that fills the response buffer.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The large size passed due to the underflow triggers a buffer overflow when writing the SDP response data. This overflow occurs within the global data section.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial-of-service condition, affecting connected Bluetooth devices due to the L2CAP channel invalidation.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the initial advisory was unable to reproduce RCE, the more detailed analysis from Cymotive Technologies explains that by carefully crafting the overflow, it is possible to overwrite a function pointer (PFN) in memory. This function pointer is used as a callback and can be hijacked to control the code execution flow which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Bluetooth Communication:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Bluetooth protocol. Specifically, by sending crafted L2CAP configuration requests and subsequently triggering an SDP query.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to pair or bond with the vulnerable system. They only need to be within Bluetooth range and able to establish a connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the target device.
*   **Bluetooth Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of Bluetooth protocols, specifically L2CAP and SDP.
*   **Ability to Send Crafted Packets:**  The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted L2CAP configuration requests and SDP requests.

**Additional Details from Cymotive's Analysis:**
*   **Exploitation Details:** Cymotive's analysis goes into detail on how to exploit the vulnerability. They explain that the SDP server code trusts L2CAP to return a valid MTU, which is exploited. The overflow can be controlled to overwrite a function pointer. They also describe how to overcome DEP using JOP due to the stack not being overwritten.
*   **"Hell2CAP":** Cymotive refers to this vulnerability as "Hell2CAP."

**Affected Versions:** Blue SDK versions 3.2, all 4.x, 5.0 through 5.5.3, and 6.0 are vulnerable. Versions 5.5.4 and 6.0.1 are not affected.

**Mitigation:** OpenSynergy has released remedies for the affected versions, which customers need to apply to their source code or use versions where the fix has been applied.
