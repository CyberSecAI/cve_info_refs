From what I read, this only works with the old version of Google forms. I cannot convert my new version of Google form to be old version, so this does not work for me. I would give it you 5 Stars if it worked with a new version of Google forms.

Doesn’t work with new Google Forms and it is too complicated to get it to work otherwise.

### [Google Form not created & always “Unable to process Google Form short code”](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/google-form-not-created-always-unable-to-process-google-form-short-code/)

I’ve been trying to make it work for the past 2 days.
Whenever I add a new Google Form, it doesn’t appear in the Google Forms window (http://prntscr.com/iawl12 – it’s always empty, no matter how many I create). It just creates the post with the shortcode, which also when checking the page of the post, doesn’t show any form, just an error – “Unable to process Google Form short code”.
I even tested with the autors test case (http://prntscr.com/iawpi9) from here -http://michaelwalsh.org/wordpress/wordpress-plugins/wpgform/sample-form/, and still got the error message “Unable to process Google Form short code” (http://prntscr.com/iawqfo). I’m not sure if the URL has anything to do with this, as I noticed that when creating the Google From it says that it will be created in /wpgforms/test, but in the output it’s created in /test/?lang=ro (http://prntscr.com/iawrx9).
If I use the shortcode that is supposedly deprecated – [gform], it does show the form, but that way I have very little customization options.

So, the ONLY reason I foolishly activated this plugin was to attempt to customize a Google form to match My site. I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND NOTICES the plugin author provided and reverted My form back to the old Google Form format to accommodate this plugin.
The new Google Forms allows you to do quite a bit of customization so this plugin is not necessary for simple desires such as resizing the form for embedding into your webpage and customizing colors — which the new Google Forms provides easy ways to do.
I’m MOST annoyed that something in this plugin’s installation has now disrupted My PREVIEW function and is wasting My time to fix.
I searched through the support forums to see if anyone else encountered this aggravation and a fix was provided. No such luck.
By the time someone will get back to Me about this disruption, I will have fixed it Myself.
SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT AND WASTE OF MY TIME.

Really appreciate your work Mike. It still working well.
Yet, you need to use old google form format. Just copy the published URL of the form and paste it in the add ‘New Google Form’ settings. Next just need to add the &hl=en parameter to my form URL as before that the form appear to be in other language. I want it to be in English.
