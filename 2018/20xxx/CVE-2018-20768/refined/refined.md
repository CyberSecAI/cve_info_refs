The provided content is a security bulletin from Xerox detailing fixes for multiple vulnerabilities in their WorkCentre and Phaser printer lines. While it doesn't specifically mention CVE-2018-20768, it lists several vulnerabilities that could be related or are similar in nature. It is possible that CVE-2018-20768 is one of the vulnerabilities included in this bulletin but it is not explicitly mentioned.

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

*   **HTTP Security Header Not Detected/HTTP Header missing:**
    *   **Weakness:** Missing or improperly configured HTTP security headers.
    *   **Impact:** Could allow various attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other header-based vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the device's web interface.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*   **Local File Inclusion:**
    *   **Weakness:** The software allows an attacker to include local files, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Possible information disclosure, potentially leading to further exploitation
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*   **Remote Command Execution (authenticated):**
    *   **Weakness:** Vulnerability enabling attackers, with valid credentials, to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the device, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface or other authenticated interfaces.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Valid credentials to access the device.

*  **Remote Command Execution (unauthenticated):**
    *   **Weakness:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands without needing any authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the device, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via network interfaces of the device.
     *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*   **Writable file to Execute PHP code:**
    *   **Weakness:** The device allows writing to a file that will be then executed as PHP code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to a full system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface or other exposed interfaces.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Weakness:** Software vulnerable to SQL injection where the results of the injection are not directly visible, requiring inference.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data breach, data manipulation, and further exploitation.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*  **Cross frame scripting:**
    *  **Weakness:** Vulnerability that allows for injecting malicious scripts into the context of another website.
    *  **Impact:** Stealing user's session cookies, user data, redirecting to malicious website or other malicious actions.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*  **HTTP Parameter pollution:**
   *  **Weakness:** The device might be vulnerable to attacks exploiting the way the web application parses HTTP parameters.
   *  **Impact:** Bypass input validation, access hidden features, cause denial of service or other security issues.
   *  **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation via the device's web interface.
   *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Network access to the device.

*   **Weak SSL certificate/SSL Certificate Hostname Discrepancy:**
    *   **Weakness:** Use of weak SSL certificates and/or a mismatch between the hostname in the certificate and the actual device hostname.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the device's encrypted communication.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to intercept network traffic.

The bulletin indicates that the listed fixes are included in the SPAR Release 3.50.01.16 or .17 and SPAR Release R18-05 073.xxx.0487.15000. It recommends updating to the specified or higher versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
