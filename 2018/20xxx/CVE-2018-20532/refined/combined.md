# USN-3916-1: libsolv vulnerabilities

22 March 2019

Libzip could be made to crash if it received specially crafted input.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [libsolv](/security/cves?package=libsolv) - A dependency solver using a satisfiablility algorithm

## Details

It was discovered that libsolv incorrectly handled certain malformed input. If a

user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted file,

applications that rely on libsolv could be made to crash, resulting in a denial

of service.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1047962#c0)  Forgotten User j7NKfSdKw6   2017-07-10 13:33:47 UTC  ``` Autocomplete works only for specific zypper commands like "zypper install" or "zypper info". It's probably not implemented but it would be very helpful if package name autocomplete would work for other commands like "zypper addlock". Since some zypper commands already have autocomplete for further command options (for example "zypper addlock --type") there would be a need to start autocomplete for package names only when a character different from dash/minus (--) is entered.  workflow example: I want to lock a specific Intel package, but I'm unsure about the right package name 1. type "sudo zypper addlock intel" 2. double tap TAB 3. autocomplete suggest "intel-cmt-cat intel-gpu-tools intelhex intel-SINIT" ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1047962#c1)  Michael Andres   2019-02-26 16:59:18 UTC  ``` Added autocomplete for addlock in zypper 1.14.27 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1047962#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-07-31 22:11:23 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2030-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has 41 fixes is now available.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1668256#c0)  Karel Srot    2019-01-22 10:03:40 UTC  ``` I am seeing this issue on RHEL-7.6. The comment in [bug 1554820](show_bug.cgi?id=1554820 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - \"dnf upgrade\" reinstalls kernel packages reporting it cannot install best update candidate") suggests it has been fixed in libsolv-0.6.35-3 however in RHEL-7 we have libsolv-0.6.34-2.el7.  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1554820](show_bug.cgi?id=1554820 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - \"dnf upgrade\" reinstalls kernel packages reporting it cannot install best update candidate") +++  Description of problem:  When running "dnf upgrade", it reports that it cannot install the best update candidate for kernel related packages and suggests to reinstall them. When you confirm the operation, it produces the same output with the next "dnf upgrade".  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  dnf-2.7.5-8.fc28.noarch  How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run the "dnf upgrade" command  Actual results:  Problem 1: cannot install both kernel-4.16.0-0.rc4.git0.1.fc28.x86_64 and kernel-4.16.0-0.rc4.git0.1.fc28.x86_64   - cannot install the best update candidate for package kernel-4.16.0-0.rc4.git0.1.fc28.x86_64   - cannot install the best update candidate for package kernel-4.15.7-300.fc27.x86_64  Expected results:  Dnf should not reinstall packages when there are no updates available.

Thanks a lot.  --- Additional comment from Gerry Agbobada on 2018-04-11 12:01:56 UTC ---  I have the same issue, so I'll provide the debugdata from dnf (Sorry for all the copr related data, but I'm not sure I'm supposed to filter them out).  I have the same F28Beta version of Fedora, and kernel keeps asking about reinstalling each time I run the upgrade command (with also a small issue about nss-pem package, it could show up in the debugdata).  The copr doesn't work when I try to update dnf (even after correcting the small typo in rpmsoftwaremanagement name)  --- Additional comment from Gerry Agbobada on 2018-04-11 12:03 UTC ---  The requested data  --- Additional comment from Michael Young on 2018-04-12 22:18:07 UTC ---  It is related to modular support, and possibly libmodulemd. I saw it in a server updated from Boltron, which went away when I deleted the left over module yaml files. I recently replaced the install with a F28 server one, and the symptom has just reappeared after the latest update to dnf-2.7.5-9.fc28 which pulled in libmodulemd.

An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has 41
fixes is now available.
Description:
This update for libzypp and libsolv fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2018-20532: Fixed NULL pointer dereference at ext/testcase.c
(function testcase\_read) (bsc#1120629).
- CVE-2018-20533: Fixed NULL pointer dereference at ext/testcase.c
(function testcase\_str2dep\_complex) in libsolvext.a (bsc#1120630).
- CVE-2018-20534: Fixed illegal address access at src/pool.h (function
pool\_whatprovides) in libsolv.a (bsc#1120631).
Fixed bugs and enhancements:
- make cleandeps jobs on patterns work (bnc#1137977)
- Fixed an issue where libsolv failed to build against swig 4.0 by
updating the version to 0.7.5 (bsc#1135749).
- Virtualization host upgrade from SLES-15 to SLES-15-SP1 finished with
wrong product name shown up (bsc#1131823).
- Copy pattern categories from the rpm that defines the pattern
(fate#323785).
- Enhance scanning /sys for modaliases (bsc#1130161).
- Prevent SEGV if the application sets an empty TextLocale (bsc#1127026).
- Handle libgpgme error when gpg key is not completely read and user hits
CTRL + C (bsc#1127220).
- Added a hint when registration codes have expired (bsc#965786).
- Adds a better handling of an error when verifying any repository medium
(bsc#1065022).
- Will now only write type field when probing (bsc#1114908).
- Fixes an issue where zypper has showed the info message 'Installation
aborted by user' while the installation was aborted by wicked
(bsc#978193).
- Suppresses reporting `/memfd:` pseudo files (bsc#1123843).
- Fixes an issue where zypper was not able to install or uninstall
packages when rpm is unavailable (bsc#1122471).
- Fixes an issue where locks were ignored (bsc#1113296).
- Simplify complex locks so zypper can display them (bsc#1112911).
- zypper will now set `SYSTEMD\_OFFLINE=1` during chrooted commits
(bsc#1118758).
- no-recommends: Nevertheless consider resolver namespaces (hardware,
language,..supporting packages) (fate#325513).
- Removes world-readable bit from /var/log/zypp (bsc#1099019).
- Does no longer fail service-refresh on a empty repoindex.xml
(bsc#1116840).
- Fixes soname due to libsolv ABI changes (bsc#1115341).
- Add infrastructure to flag specific packages to trigger a reboot needed
hint (fate#326451).
This update for zypper 1.14.27 fixes the following issues:
- bash-completion: add package completion for addlock (bsc#1047962)
- bash-completion: fix incorrect detection of command names (bsc#1049826)
- Offer to change the 'runSearchPackages' config option at the prompt
(bsc#1119373, FATE#325599)
- Prompt: provide a 'yes/no/always/never' prompt.
- Prompt: support "#NUM" as answer to select the NUMth option...
- Augeas: enable writing back changed option values (to ~/.zypper.conf)
- removelocale: fix segfault
- Move needs-restarting command to subpackage (fixes #254)
- Allow empty string as argument (bsc#1125415)
- Provide a way to delete cache for volatile repositories (bsc#1053177)
- Adapt to boost-1.69 requiring explicit casts tribool->bool (fixes #255)
- Show support status in info if not unknown (bsc#764147)
- Fix installing plain rpm files with `zypper in` (bsc#1124897)
- Show only required info in the summary in quiet mode (bsc#993025)
- Stay with legacy behavior and return ZYPPER\_EXIT\_INF\_REBOOT\_NEEDED
only for patches. We don't extend this return code to packages, although
they may also carry the 'reboot-needed' attribute. The preferred way to
test whether the system needs to be rebooted is `zypper
needs-rebooting`. (openSUSE/zypper#237)
- Skip repository on error (bsc#1123967)
- New commands for locale management: locales addlocale removelocale
Inspect and manipulate the systems `requested locales`, aka. the
languages software packages should try support by installing
translations, dictionaries and tools, as far as they are available.
- Don't throw, just warn if options are repeated (bsc#1123865)
- Fix detection whether stdout is a tty (happened too late)
- Fix broken --plus-content switch (fixes bsc#1123681)
- Fix broken --replacefiles switch (fixes bsc#1123137)
- Extend zypper source-install (fixes bsc#663358)
- Fix inconsistent results for search (bsc#1119873)
- Show reboot hint in zypper ps and summary (fixes bsc#1120263)
- Improve handling of partially locked packages (bsc#1113296)
- Fix wrong default values in help text (bsc#1121611)
- Fixed broken argument parsing for --reposd-dir (bsc#1122062)
- Fix wrong zypp::indeterminate use (bsc#1120463)
- CLI parser: fix broken initialization enforcing 'select by name'
(bsc#1119820)
- zypper.conf: [commit] autoAgreeWithLicenses {=false} (fixes #220)
- locks: Fix printing of versioned locks (bsc#1112911)
- locks: create and write versioned locks correctly (bsc#1112911)
- patch: --with update may implicitly assume --with-optional (bsc#1102261)
- no-recommends: Nevertheless consider resolver namespaces (hardware,
language,..supporting packages) (FATE#325513)
- Optionally run "zypper search-packages" after "search" (FATE#325599)
- zypper.conf: Add [search]runSearchPackages config variable.
- Don't iterate twice on --no-cd (bsc#1111319)
