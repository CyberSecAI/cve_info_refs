Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20750:

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-20750 is a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in LibVNCServer, specifically in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c`. The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2018-15127). An attacker can exploit this by sending crafted VNC packets which leads to a heap overflow.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incomplete patch for CVE-2018-15127. The original fix did not fully address the heap out-of-bounds write issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c`.
*   Integer overflow issues when handling lengths in `rfbProcessFileTransferReadBuffer` which can cause heap overflow when allocating memory. The fix is to limit the length to `INT_MAX`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote code execution:** An attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution due to the heap out-of-bounds write.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack can cause a denial of service by crashing the application or server.
*   **Information disclosure:** By writing outside the buffer, there might be potential for information leaks (though less likely with a simple out-of-bounds write).

**Attack vectors:**
*   A remote attacker sends specially crafted VNC packets to an application or server using LibVNCServer.
*   The attacker can achieve this by connecting to a vulnerable VNC server and then sending malicious file transfer requests or specially crafted messages that trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable VNC server.
*   **Knowledge of the VNC Protocol:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious VNC protocol messages.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The issue is related to how `malloc` calls are handled in `libvncserver`, especially when dealing with lengths read from the VNC protocol.
*   The initial fixes involving casting to `(uint64_t)` before adding 1 in `malloc` calls were insufficient to prevent overflows, especially on 32-bit systems or when dealing with a malicious server.
*   The `rfbProcessFileTransferReadBuffer` function is directly involved with a limit now added using `INT_MAX` to prevent integer overflows, which is a second vulnerability point.
*   The vulnerability impacts both client and server applications that use the affected versions of LibVNCServer.
*   Multiple vendors, including Siemens and Ubuntu, have released security advisories and updates to address this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2018-20750 is a serious security flaw that can be exploited remotely, and its resolution requires careful attention to integer overflow checks and proper memory allocation.
