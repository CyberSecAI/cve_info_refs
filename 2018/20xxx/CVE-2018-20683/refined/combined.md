> Nick Cleaton (nick@cleaton.net) found and reported a security issue
> caused by trusting the remote rsync too much.  It appears that rsync
> cannot -- without special precautions -- be used in any "restricted"
> environment.
>
> Gitolite ships with a "bundle helper" called "rsync" (disabled

> helper to close this hole.
>
> TLDR for administrators and packagers:
>
> 1.  Am I affected?
>
>     Look in ~/.gitolite.rc for "rsync"; if it is there, you are
>     affected.
>
>     This is NOT an essential program, and it is not enabled by
>     default.  You (or a previous administrator of your site)
>     would have to have explicitly enabled it for you to be
>     affected.
>
> 2.  What's the quick fix?
>
>     Comment out the "rsync" line in ~/.gitolite.rc IMMEDIATELY.
>
>     DO NOT LEAVE IT ENABLED IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY!
>     Uncomment it only after you have upgraded or patched.
>
> 3.  That bad, huh?
>
>     Sadly, yes :(
>
> DETAILS:
>
> This program is not a core program.  Despite the name, it will not
> function as a generic "rsync".
>
> This is *only* meant to help out people who are on flaky connections,
> trying to clone a large repo.
>
> Because git clone is not resumable, one common technique is to have
> someone create a "bundle", then download the bundle to seed the local
> repo, then "git fetch" to finish off.  Since the bundle is a single
> file, you can use resumable mechanisms (like rsync) to download it.
>
> What this command does is allow that kind of bundling to happen
> automatically, if an administrator enables it.
>
> The user simply rsyncs a bundle file using his gitolite
> credentials.  As a result, the rsync helper command that ships
> with gitolite is executed.  This program manages the creation
> and expiry of bundle files, then passes control to the *real*
> rsync program to perform the actual data transfer.
>
> It is this last step that requires special care when used in a
> restricted environment, resulting in the need for this patch.

 allow simple test code to be embedded within the gitolite.conf file; see contrib/utils/testconf for how. (This goes on the client side, not on the server)
 allow syslog "facility" to be changed, from the default of 'local0'
 allow @group names in config values to be expanded; it is replaced with a space separated list of members
2016-09-08 v3.6.6 simple but important fix for a future perl deprecation (perl will be removing "." from @INC in 5.24)
 'perms' now requires a '-c' to activate batch mode (should not affect interactive use but check your scripts perhaps?)
 gitolite setup now accepts a '-m' option to supply a custom message (useful when it is used by a script)
2016-02-20 v3.6.5 allow creator check to be bypassed during mirroring
 handle new style ssh fingerprinting correctly (thanks to Robin Johnson)
 allow pre-auto-gc as a repo-specific hook
 optimise mirror pushes for heavily used repos
 create-with-reference trigger: on repo creation, setup objects/info/alternates for a server side alternate object store.

 (finally!) allow limited symlinks within ~/repositories; see commit 8e36230 for details
 perms command now lists available roles
 minor backward compat breakage: 'perms -l repo' no longer works; see 'perms -h' for new usage
 allow gitolite-shell to be used as $SHELL (experts only; no support, no docs; see commit 9cd1e37 for details)
 help with 'git push --signed' using a post-receive hook to adopt push certs into 'refs/push-certs'; for details see contrib/hooks/repo-specific/save-push-signatures
 new 'transparent proxy' feature for git repos; see src/lib/Gitolite/Triggers/TProxy.pm for details
2014-11-10 v3.6.2 disable ../ everywhere (see mailing list thread for details)
 VREF/NAME\_NC -- like VREF/NAME but for new commits only. Details within src/VREF/NAME\_NC.

2014-06-22 v3.6.1 experimental rc format convertor for "<= 3.3" users who have already upgraded the \*code\* to ">= v3.4". Program is in contrib/utils.
 giving shell access to a few users got a lot easier (see comments in the rc file).
 allow logging to syslog as well (see comments in the rc file)
 new 'motd' command
 redis caching redone and now in core; see http://gitolite.com/gitolite/cache.html
2014-05-09 v3.6 (cool stuff) the access command can now help you debug your rules / understand how a specific access decision was arrived at.
 mirroring: since mirroring is asynchronous (by default anyway), when a 'git push --mirror' fails, you may not know it unless you look in the log file on the server. Now gitolite captures the info and -- if the word 'fatal' appears anywhere within it, it saves the entire output and prints it to STDERR for anyone who reads or writes the repo on the \*master\* server, until the error condition clears up.
 mirroring: allow 'nosync' slaves -- no attempt to automatically push to these slaves will be made. Instead, you have to manually (or via cron, etc) trigger pushes.
 (backward compat breakage) the old v2 syntax for specifying gitweb owner and description is no longer supported.
 macros now allow strings as arguments (thanks to Jason Donenfeld for the idea/problem).
 the 'info' command can print in JSON format if asked to.
 repo-specific hooks: now you can specify more than one, and gitolite runs all of them in sequence.
 new trigger 'expand-deny-messages' to show more details when access is denied.
 git-annex support is finally in master, yaaay!
 new 'readme' command, modelled after 'desc'. Apparently gitweb can use a README.html file in the \*bare\* repo directory -- who knew!
2013-10-14 v3.5.3 catch undefined groupnames (when possible)
 mirroring: async push to slaves
 (some portability fixes)
 (a couple of contrib scripts - querying IPA based LDAP servers for group membership, and user key management)
 allow groups in subconf files (this \*may\* slow down compilation in extreme cases)
 make adding repo-specific hooks easier (see cust.mkd or cust.html online for docs)
 smart http now supports git 1.8.2 and above (which changed the protocol requirements a wee bit)
2013-07-10 v3.5.2 allow ENV vars to be set from repo options, for use in triggers and hooks
 bug-fix: the new set-default-roles feature was being invoked on every run of "perms" and overriding it!
2013-03-24 v3.5 (2 minor backward compat breakages) 1. 'DEFAULT\_ROLE\_PERMS' replaced by per repo 'default.roles' option 2. 'gitolite list-memberships' now requires a '-r' or a '-u' flag
 new 'gitolite owns' command (thanks to Kevin Pulo)
2013-03-05 v3.4 new rc file format makes it much easier to enable specific features
2012-12-29 v3.3 bug fix: gl-perms propagation to slaves broke sometime after v3.2 (so if you're only picking up tagged releases you're OK)
 the "D" command now allows rm/unlock to be totally disabled
 new trigger: update-gitweb-daemon-from-options; another way to update gitweb and daemon access lists
 new 'create' command for explicit wild repo creation, and new AutoCreate trigger to control auto-creation
 allow simple macros in conf file
2012-11-14 v3.2 major efficiency boost for large setups

 new 'sudo' command
 minor backward compat breakage in 'gitolite query-rc'
 'perms' command can now create repo if needed
 migrated 'symbolic-ref' command

tighten up security for rsync

```
Nick Cleaton (nick@cleaton.net) found and reported a security issue
caused by trusting the remote rsync too much.  It appears that rsync
cannot -- without special precautions -- be used in any "restricted"
environment.

Gitolite ships with a "bundle helper" called "rsync" (disabled
by default; more details below).  This fix tightens up this
helper to close this hole.

TLDR for administrators and packagers:

1.  Am I affected?

    Look in ~/.gitolite.rc for "rsync"; if it is there, you are
    affected.

    This is NOT an essential program, and it is not enabled by
    default.  You (or a previous administrator of your site)
    would have to have explicitly enabled it for you to be
    affected.

2.  What's the quick fix?

    Comment out the "rsync" line in ~/.gitolite.rc IMMEDIATELY.

    DO NOT LEAVE IT ENABLED IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY!
    Uncomment it only after you have upgraded or patched.

3.  That bad, huh?

    Sadly, yes :(

DETAILS:

This program is not a core program.  Despite the name, it will not
function as a generic "rsync".

This is *only* meant to help out people who are on flaky connections,
trying to clone a large repo.

Because git clone is not resumable, one common technique is to have
someone create a "bundle", then download the bundle to seed the local
repo, then "git fetch" to finish off.  Since the bundle is a single
file, you can use resumable mechanisms (like rsync) to download it.

What this command does is allow that kind of bundling to happen
automatically, if an administrator enables it.

The user simply rsyncs a bundle file using his gitolite
credentials.  As a result, the rsync helper command that ships
with gitolite is executed.  This program manages the creation
and expiry of bundle files, then passes control to the *real*
rsync program to perform the actual data transfer.

It is this last step that requires special care when used in a
restricted environment, resulting in the need for this patch.
```

| --- | --- |
| **Description** | commands/rsync in Gitolite before 3.6.11, if .gitolite.rc enables rsync, mishandles the rsync command line, which allows attackers to have a "bad" impact by triggering use of an option other than -v, -n, -q, or -P. |
