The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in FrogCMS version 0.9.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the file manager plugin of FrogCMS where it doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating and saving files. Specifically, it allows the inclusion of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation when creating new files within the file manager.
- The application directly reflects the unsanitized input when the created file is accessed via the `/public/` path, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access a file created by the attacker.
- This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the file manager.
- The attacker creates a file using the file manager and includes malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<img src=1 onerror=alert(/du/)>`).
- The attacker or another user then accesses the file through the `/public` directory, triggering the execution of the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account and be logged into the FrogCMS application.
- The attacker needs to have access to the file manager functionality, which is usually available to administrators or authorized users.
