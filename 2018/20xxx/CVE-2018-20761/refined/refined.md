Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20761:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `gf_sm_load_init()` function within `scene_manager.c`. Specifically, the `strcpy(szExt, &ext[1]);` line copies the file extension into the `szExt` buffer without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow by providing an overly long file extension in the input file name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow. The `strcpy` function is used without checking the length of the source string, which can write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** As demonstrated in the provided example, a crafted input file with a long extension can cause the application (MP4Box) to crash due to a stack smashing detection.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability description also mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code" which means the buffer overflow could be exploited beyond a DoS to achieve code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted MP4 file or other file that is processed by GPAC, particularly the `MP4Box` utility.
- The file name is passed as an argument, so using a very long filename including a long extension triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file with an extremely long file extension to be processed by the vulnerable `gf_sm_load_init()` function. 
- An attacker does not need local access but can execute this vulnerability via a crafted file processed by a vulnerable GPAC application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding length checks before the strcpy calls are made and using strncpy instead. This is shown in the provided commit diffs. The fix specifically addresses the `strcpy` in `gf_sm_load_init()` function which copies the file extension as well as the same issue in other locations.
- The issue was reported with a specific example using the MP4Box utility and a file named with a very long extension.
- This issue has been assigned the CVE IDs CVE-2018-7752, CVE-2018-20760, CVE-2018-20761, CVE-2018-20762 and CVE-2018-20763.
