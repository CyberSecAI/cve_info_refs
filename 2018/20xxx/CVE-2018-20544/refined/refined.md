Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-20544:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a floating-point exception within the `caca_dither_bitmap` function located in the `caca/dither.c` file of the libcaca library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A floating-point exception can occur when processing specific image data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS). When the floating-point exception is triggered, the affected application will likely crash, disrupting the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file or image data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious image file to an application using the vulnerable libcaca library. No special privileges are required.
