- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A missing size check when parsing a sender-provided packet during WhatsApp for iOS call reception.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to the lack of size validation on incoming packet data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution by overflowing the stack.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when receiving a call through WhatsApp on iOS. The attacker needs to send a malicious packet during the call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to initiate a WhatsApp call to the target. They need to manipulate the packet data sent during call establishment or during the call.

The provided information is more detailed than the description in the CVE, as it specifies the vulnerability is in call reception using WhatsApp for iOS, and not a general vulnerability in WhatsApp.
