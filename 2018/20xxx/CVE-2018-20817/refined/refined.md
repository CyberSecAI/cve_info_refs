Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2018-20817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `SV_SteamAuthClient` function of Call of Duty games.
*   The function receives a user's `authBlob` (authentication blob) as part of the Steam authentication process.
*   A critical flaw exists: the code does not validate that the length of `authBlob` is smaller than the buffer allocated on the stack before using `MSG_ReadData` to read the data into the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** By sending a crafted `steamAuth` packet with an `authBlob` larger than the allocated buffer, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Overwriting the stack can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** An attacker can send a malicious `steamAuth` packet to a vulnerable Call of Duty server or client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable Call of Duty server or client. This typically implies being on the same network or being able to connect to the game server.
*   The attacker needs to craft a special `steamAuth` packet that contains an oversized `authBlob`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) repository that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates that the vulnerability is not merely theoretical but has been practically demonstrated.
* The PoC is for various Call of Duty games.
* The vulnerability is triggered by an unchecked read using the `MSG_ReadData` function.
* A code snippet image is provided showing where the vulnerability exists.
