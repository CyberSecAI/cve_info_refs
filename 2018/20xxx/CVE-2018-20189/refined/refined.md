Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the `ReadDIBImage` function in `coders/dib.c` of the GraphicsMagick library. Specifically, it's triggered by an assertion error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Assertion Error:** The `ReadDIBImage` function contains an assertion that can be triggered by malformed input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted image file that triggers the assertion error, causing the application using GraphicsMagick to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Crafted Image File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specifically crafted DIB image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file to an application that uses the vulnerable GraphicsMagick library to process images. This could be a user uploading an image to a web server or an application processing an image received from an external source.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue is present in GraphicsMagick versions prior to the fixes released in the security updates.
*   The vulnerability is classified as remote, implying that the attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable machine.
*   Multiple related CVEs (CVE-2018-20184, CVE-2018-20185, CVE-2019-11005, etc.) were addressed in the same security updates for GraphicsMagick.
