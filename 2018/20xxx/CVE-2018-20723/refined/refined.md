  "CVE-2018-20723": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in color_templates.php in Cacti before 1.2.0 due to lack of escaping of unintended characters in the Name field for a Color.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of escaping of user-supplied input within the 'Name' field in the color_templates.php file before being rendered in the HTML page.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'Name' field, which could be executed in the victim's browser when viewing color templates.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user with high privileges, as indicated by 'Privileges Required: High' in the CVSS v3 score, needs to inject the malicious code. A victim then must interact with the malicious code to trigger the vulnerability."

  "CVE-2018-20724": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in pollers.php in Cacti before 1.2.0 due to lack of escaping of unintended characters in the Website Hostname for Data Collectors.",
     "root_cause": "The root cause is a lack of output sanitization in the 'Website Hostname' field within pollers.php before being rendered to the HTML page, allowing arbitrary code to be executed in the browser.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with a high level of privileges can inject a malicious payload into the 'Website Hostname' field via the web interface, then the vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses the vulnerable page. User interaction is required to trigger the XSS."

   "CVE-2018-20725": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in graph_templates.php in Cacti before 1.2.0 due to lack of escaping of unintended characters in the Graph Vertical Label.",

     "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with high privileges, as indicated by 'Privileges Required: High' in the CVSS v3 score, needs to inject the malicious code into the 'Graph Vertical Label' field, and the user has to interact with the page for XSS to trigger."

  "CVE-2018-20726": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in host.php (via tree.php) in Cacti before 1.2.0 due to lack of escaping of unintended characters in the Website Hostname field for Devices.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output encoding in the 'Website Hostname' field before being rendered within the HTML on the host.php page (via tree.php). This allows for malicious script injection.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"

  "CVE-2009-4112": {
    "description": "Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to gain privileges by modifying the \"Data Input Method\" for the \"Linux - Get Memory Usage\" setting to contain arbitrary commands.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation and sanitization for the Data Input Method when configured for the 'Linux - Get Memory Usage' setting, which allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.",

        "Command Injection",
        "Privilege Escalation"

    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with administrator-level authentication needs to modify the Data Input Method to inject malicious command(s). Once modified, arbitrary commands can be executed by the web server."
