## Description

Take complete control of your images with Perfect Images! This powerful plugin helps you optimize and manage your images with ease. Seamlessly replace or regenerate existing images in bulk, set custom sizes, improve performance, and create retina-ready versions for high-quality displays. Whether you’re working with core JPEGs, WebPs, or AVIFs, Perfect Images has you covered. Upscaling is also supported to generate thumbnails that weren’t possible before. With additional features like CDN support and the ability to disable image thresholding, you can fine-tune your image management to suit your needs. Perfect Images is fast, efficient, and fully compatible with other plugins without creating new database tables.

**Key Features:**

* **Manage Image Sizes**: Customize, disable, and track image sizes effortlessly.
* **Replace Image**: Swap out images directly from the Media Library or the plugin dashboard.
* **Regenerate Thumbnails**: Update thumbnails in bulk with a handy progress tracker.
* **Upscaling**: Enhance image resolution and generate better thumbnails, even for previously unsupported sizes.
* **Retina Images / High DPI**: Automatically create and serve stunning retina images.
* **WebP & AVIF Support**: Generate and serve modern image formats for better performance and quality.
* **CDN Integration**: Optimize and deliver images via EWWW Image Optimization.
* **Disable Image Threshold**: Disable WordPress’ automatic image scaling feature.

**Pro Features:**

* Retina support for full-size images.
* WebP and AVIF support for full-size images.
* Priority support from the Meow Apps team.

Originally designed to handle retina images, Perfect Images has evolved into an indispensable tool for any WordPress site.

### Features in Detail

### Manage Image Sizes

Simplify your image management by disabling unnecessary sizes and tracking the sizes created for each media entry. For instance, you can disable WordPress-generated sizes like `medium_large`, `1536x1536`, and `2048x2048` to save space and resources.

### Replace Image & Media

Replace images quickly and effortlessly. Whether through the dedicated plugin dashboard or directly from the Media Library and Edit Attachment pages, you can streamline your workflow and avoid manual replacements.

### Regenerate Thumbnails

Update your thumbnails in bulk with ease. A built-in progress bar keeps you informed, while the plugin handles all the details, including regenerating retina images and updating media metadata. Upscaling ensures that thumbnails can even be created for sizes that were previously unsupported.

### Retina Images / High DPI

Ensure your site looks stunning on all devices. Perfect Images generates and serves retina-ready images automatically. Additionally, you can manually create retina images and even generate retina versions for full-size images. Visit our official website for more details and tutorials.

### Disable Image Threshold

Disable WordPress’ automatic scaling of large images, preventing files with “-scaled” in their filenames from being created.

## FAQ

Users, you will find the FAQ here: https://meowapps.com/wp-retina-2x/faq/.

Developers, WP Retina 2x has a little API. Here are a few filters and actions you might want to use.

### Functions

* wr2x\_get\_retina\_from\_url( $url ): return the URL of the retina image (empty string if not found)
* wr2x\_get\_retina( $syspath ): return the system path of the retina image (null if not found)

### Actions

* wr2x\_retina\_file\_added: called when a new retina file is created, 1st argument is $attachment\_id (of the media) and second is the $retina\_filepath
* wr2x\_retina\_file\_removed: called when a new retina file is removed, 1st argument is $attachment\_id (of the media) and second is the $retina\_filepath

### Filters

* wr2x\_img\_url: you can check and potentially override the $wr2x\_img\_url (normal/original image from the src) that will be used in the srcset for 1x
* wr2x\_img\_retina\_url: you can check and potentially override the $wr2x\_img\_retina\_url (retina image) that will be used in the srcset for 2x
* wr2x\_img\_src: you can check and potentially override the $wr2x\_img\_src that will be used in the img’s src (only used in Pro version)
* wr2x\_validate\_src: the img src is passed; return it if it is valid, return null if it should be skipped

Sorry, but I followed the easy to read directions and with a new blog post the images do not show. I do not have the time or desire to try to fix this problem as there are other image optimizers to choose from that all have 5 star ratings.

Thanks for your plugin and your effort in keeping it updated. My older plugin for images no longer worked with php 7, so hope this will continue with it as it does now.
