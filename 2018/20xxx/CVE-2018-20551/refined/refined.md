```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of a check for the dict data type in the FileSpec class, leading to a reachable Object::dictLookup assertion.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper input validation",
    "Unchecked assertion",
    "Denial of service"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious PDF file that triggers the assertion, leading to program termination.",
  "Attack vector": "A specially crafted PDF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify PDF files to contain the specific malicious data. They need to get the victim to open the malicious PDF with a vulnerable version of poppler."
