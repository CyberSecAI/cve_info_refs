Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the StackStorm API endpoint `GET /v1/keys`. The `?scope=all` and `?user=<username>` query parameter filters were not correctly handled, allowing unauthorized access to datastore items.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure API Endpoint:** The `/v1/keys` API endpoint allowed unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper validation for the `scope` and `user` query parameters allowed users to bypass intended access restrictions.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users could retrieve datastore items belonging to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** An authenticated user could retrieve user-scoped datastore items intended for other users, potentially exposing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, configurations).
- **Confidentiality Violation:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to user-specific data, violating the confidentiality principle.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** A remote authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability by making specially crafted API requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be a valid StackStorm user.
- **API Access:** The attacker must be able to make API requests to the StackStorm instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects StackStorm versions 1.5.0 through 2.10.0 (inclusive).
- Enterprise editions with RBAC enabled were not affected, because RBAC restricted access to the vulnerable parameters to admin users only.
- The vulnerability was fixed in StackStorm versions 2.9.2 and 2.10.1.
- The provided text includes information about responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and security procedures at StackStorm.
