The provided content from Exploit Database details multiple vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4. While it doesn't directly reference CVE-2018-20790, the vulnerabilities described are related to file handling, and it is possible that one of these is CVE-2018-20790. The information is still useful for understanding security issues of the software.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (get_file action):**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` when handling the `get_file` action.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by providing a manipulated path, e.g. `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php?action=get_file` with a malicious `path` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**2. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (copy_cut & paste_clipboard actions):**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` (copy/cut action) and `execute.php` (paste_clipboard) action.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by first copying the file via the vulnerable copy/cut, which saves the path into the session, and then pasting the file using `paste_clipboard`, allowing arbitrary file read from the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Two-step process. First sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php?action=copy_cut` with a malicious `path` parameter. Then, sending a POST request to  `execute.php?action=paste_clipboard`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and maintain a session.

**3. Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (create_file action):**

*   **Root Cause:**  The path traversal mitigation was bypassed by using an array for `paths` and `names` parameters in `execute.php` when handling the `create_file` action.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass, arbitrary file write.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the server at a location of their choosing.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php?action=create_file` with malicious `paths` and `names` array parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and maintain a session.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (delete_file action):**

*   **Root Cause:** The path traversal mitigation was bypassed by using an array for the `paths` parameter in `execute.php` when handling the `delete_file` action.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass, arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php?action=delete_file` with a malicious `paths` array parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and maintain a session.

**5. Arbitrary Directory Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (delete_folder action):**

*   **Root Cause:** The path traversal mitigation was bypassed by using an array for the `paths` parameter in `execute.php` when handling the `delete_folder` action.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass, arbitrary directory deletion.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary directories on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php?action=delete_folder` with a malicious `paths` array parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and maintain a session.

**6. Arbitrary File Write (image files only) via Path Traversal (save_img action):**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` when handling the `save_img` action, coupled with the lack of extension validation, allowing saving a file with specific image extensions.
*   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability, arbitrary file write (restricted to jpg/jpeg/png).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write image files to the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php?action=save_img` with malicious `path`, `name` and `url` parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server and access to a URL to download the image from.

**7. Persistent XSS in `media_preview` action:**

*   **Root Cause:** The filename is not sanitized before being displayed, which allows for injection of JavaScript code in the filename.
*    **Weakness:** Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they preview the media file.
*   **Attack Vector:** Upload a file with malicious JavaScript code in the file name. Then have the victim preview the uploaded file.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to upload files to the server.
