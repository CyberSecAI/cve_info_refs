A NULL pointer dereference in the XRef::getEntry class in XRef.cc file due to the mishandle of unallocated XRef entries. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF document, when XRefEntry::setFlag in XRef.h is called from Parser::makeStream in Parser.cc.

Package        : poppler
Version        : 0.26.5-2+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-19058 CVE-2018-20481 CVE-2018-20662
                 CVE-2019-7310 CVE-2019-9200
Debian Bug     : 913177 917325 918158 921215 923414

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in the poppler PDF
rendering shared library.

CVE-2018-19058

    A reachable abort in Object.h will lead to denial-of-service because
    EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an
    embedded file.

CVE-2018-20481

    Poppler mishandles unallocated XRef entries, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial-of-service (NULL pointer dereference)
    via a crafted PDF document.

CVE-2018-20662

    Poppler allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application
    crash and segmentation fault by crafting a PDF file in which an xref
    data structure is corrupted.

CVE-2019-7310

    A heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in
    the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document.

CVE-2019-9200

    A heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine()
    located at Stream.cc that can (for example) be triggered by sending
    a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to
    cause denial-of-service (segmentation fault) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.26.5-2+deb8u8.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1665273#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-10 20:19:04 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Poppler 0.72.0. The PDFDoc::setup class in PDFDoc.cc allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash caused by Object.h SIGABRT, because of a wrong return value from PDFDoc::setup) by crafting a PDF file in which an xref data structure is mishandled during extractPDFSubtype processing.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# null pointer dereference in XRef::getEntry

pdfdetach crashes when it's feeded with a specific pdf file.
The command I run with is `pdfdetach -save 1 test.pdf`.
The backtrace is here:

(gdb) p entries

```

The problem is in XRef::getEntry

```
XRefEntry *XRef::getEntry(int i, bool complainIfMissing)
{
  if (i >= size || entries[i].type == xrefEntryNone) {

    if ((!xRefStream) && mainXRefEntriesOffset) {
      if (!parseEntry(mainXRefEntriesOffset + 20*i, &entries[i])) {
        error(errSyntaxError, -1, "Failed to parse XRef entry [{0:d}].", i);
      }

```

There is lack of check where size is 0 and entries is null[nullpointerdereference.pdf](/-/project/882/uploads/b208588c92e16539930e2cc630775033/nullpointerdereference.pdf)
