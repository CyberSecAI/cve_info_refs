Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the FUEL CMS when creating or editing pages. Specifically, the `Page title`, `Meta description`, and `Meta keywords` fields are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, where malicious scripts are saved within the CMS database and executed when the page is rendered.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The CMS fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the affected fields, allowing the injection of HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to a variety of malicious outcomes.
  - **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal cookies and session tokens to impersonate legitimate users.
  - **Redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious sites.
  - **Defacement:** The page content can be modified or defaced.
  - **Malware Delivery:** JavaScript can be used to download and execute malware.
  - **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive user data could be stolen and sent to a third party.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker exploits the web interface of FUEL CMS through the page creation/editing functionality.
- **Form Injection:** The attacker inserts malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads into the vulnerable fields (Page title, Meta description, Meta keywords).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have privileges to create or edit pages within the FUEL CMS admin panel. This indicates the vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with administrative or privileged user access.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know that the Page title, Meta description and Meta keywords are vulnerable to XSS.

**Payload Examples (from the content):**

*   `</title><script>alert("LambdaX")</script>`
*   `"><script>alert("LambdaX")</script>`
