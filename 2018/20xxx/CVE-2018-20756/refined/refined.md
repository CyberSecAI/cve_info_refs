The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20756.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating a new document, specifically the `pagetitle` field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the `pagetitle` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user views the document or edits it, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- The XSS is persistent, meaning it's stored in the database and affects all users who interact with the affected resources until the malicious code is removed from the database

**Attack vectors:**
- A user creates a new document via the web interface.
- The attacker includes a malicious script in the `pagetitle` field, such as `</title><img src=# onerror=alert(1); /><!--`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify document resources. This typically requires an authenticated user account with appropriate permissions.
