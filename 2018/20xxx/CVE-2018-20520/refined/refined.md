Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `post-edit.php` script in MiniCMS, specifically line 152, where `echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];` is used without proper sanitization. This directly outputs the full request URI, including any potentially malicious parameters, back into the HTML context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The script directly echoes the unsanitized request URI, making it possible to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code through the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:** With JavaScript execution, attackers can steal user cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the web page.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website or display fake login forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that is sent to a victim.
- The malicious payload is embedded in a query parameter in the URL.
- The `post-edit.php` script will output this unsanitized URL, causing the injected JavaScript to execute in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload.
- The attacker must be able to induce a user of the MiniCMS application to visit the malicious URL.
- The user needs to be logged into MiniCMS for the full impact of the XSS to be realised.

**Technical Details:**
- The code `echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];` directly outputs the request URI.
- Different browsers handle URL encoding differently. Firefox and Chrome will URL encode the URI, preventing direct injection. However, IE will not URL encode the URI if a redirection occurs, allowing for direct injection.
- The provided exploit `http://127.0.0.1/MiniCMS1/mc-admin/post-edit.php?520=\"> <script>alert("dudu")</script>` demonstrates how to insert a JavaScript payload by adding a malicious query parameter.

This issue is a classic example of a reflected XSS vulnerability due to insufficient output sanitization.
