The content is related to CVE-2018-20572.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input in the `/coreframe/app/coupon/admin/copyfrom.php` file. Specifically, the `keywords` parameter from the GET request is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code constructs an SQL query using string concatenation and directly inserts user-controlled input ($keywords) into the `WHERE` clause of an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code via the `keywords` parameter.
- This could lead to various impacts, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even complete database takeover, depending on database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with an injected payload in the `keywords` parameter.
- The attack vector is the HTTP GET request with a crafted `keywords` parameter. The vulnerable code is in the `listing()` function within `/coreframe/app/coupon/admin/copyfrom.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- No special privileges are needed.
- The attacker can execute SQL injection by manipulating the `keywords` parameter in the GET request
