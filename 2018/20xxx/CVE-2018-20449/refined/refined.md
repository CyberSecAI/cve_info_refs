{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `hidma_chan_stats` function in `drivers/dma/qcom/hidma_dbg.c` of the Linux kernel exposes sensitive address information via debugfs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure due to insufficient sanitization of output in a debug function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can read the debugfs file and obtain potentially sensitive information like callback addresses, which could be used in further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system and reading the specific debugfs file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local user with the ability to read debugfs files is required to exploit this vulnerability."
