Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-20975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `tags_helper.rb` file. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the `query` parameter was handled when generating a link using `link_to_function`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code was vulnerable to XSS because it was directly embedding user-controlled input (`query`) into JavaScript code without proper escaping.
- The `link_to_function` helper method was used to create a JavaScript function call, which was vulnerable to injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable link.
- The attacker could potentially perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious tag (which is used to generate the `query`) containing malicious JavaScript that could be injected when a user searches using tags.
- The attack is triggered when the user clicks on a link generated by the vulnerable code which includes the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to insert specially crafted tags, which would then be used in generating vulnerable links.
-  No special privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability; any user who can interact with the tag functionality is a potential target, although the attacker needs some mechanism to influence the content of the tags.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server, just the ability to inject into the tag system.

**Additional Details**
- The fix involved escaping the JavaScript using `escape_javascript(query)`, which ensures that the injected string is treated as literal text and not executable code. This prevents the XSS vulnerability.
- This specific commit `6d60bc8ed010c4eda05d6645c64849f415f68d65` addresses this issue by adding `escape_javascript()` function to the `query` string.
- The issue is located in the `app/helpers/tags_helper.rb` file.
