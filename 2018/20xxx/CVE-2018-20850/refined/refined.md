- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A self-XSS vulnerability exists in the command line interface of the SNS web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Self-XSS vulnerability in the web interface command line, allowing injection of javascript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the administration interface can inject javascript code that persists across login/logout, potentially leading to a backdoor for maintaining access to the system. The injected script will only affect the session of the user that performed the injection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (requires access to the SNS administration interface).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid session with administrative privileges to the SNS web interface. The complexity is high because they need to be a legitimate admin already logged into the system.
