| Analysis | Impacted version |
| --- | --- |
| A self-XSS has been found in the command line interface of the SNS web interface. It allows an attacker that already has access to the administration interface to inject javascript code. The javascript code will be persisted during login/logout from the administration interface. It could be used by an attacker as a backdoor and thus persist his access to the system. | * SNS 3.0.0 to 3.7.1 * SNS 2.0.0 to 2.13.0 |

| Workaround solution | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| The use of password-based authentication instead of certificate-based authentication deactivates the vulnerability. | The 2.14, 3.7.2 and 3.8.0 updates fix this vulnerability. |
