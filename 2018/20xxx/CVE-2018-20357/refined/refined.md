Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `sbr_process_channel` function within the `libfaad/sbr_dec.c` file of the FAAD2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. This means the program attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application (faad2).
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Although not directly stated for this CVE, the Debian Security Advisory mentions that multiple vulnerabilities in faad2 "might allow remote attackers to cause denial-of-service, or *potentially execute arbitrary code* if crafted MPEG AAC files are processed". This suggests a possibility of arbitrary code execution, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory explicitly states that the "worst of which could result in the arbitrary execution of code."

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious audio file.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue occurs within the `sbr_process_channel` function at line 413 of `libfaad/sbr_dec.c`.
- The ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output clearly indicates a segmentation fault (SEGV) due to accessing address 0x000000000000, which is a null pointer.
- The crash occurs during the processing of an SBR (Spectral Band Replication) audio channel.
- The proof-of-concept (POC) file provided in the GitHub issue further confirms the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple other CVEs are associated with the same faad2 library in the provided documents, indicating a series of vulnerabilities that could be combined or exploited individually.
- The issue was fixed in faad2 version 2.9.0.
