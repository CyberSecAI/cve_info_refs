Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an SQL Injection flaw in the `booking_id` parameter of the WordPress Booking Calendar plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `booking_id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Authenticated Vulnerability:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to be authenticated to access the WordPress control panel and plugin page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Data Reading:** An attacker can read arbitrary data from the database.
*   **Remote Shell:** It's possible to gain a remote shell on the server through SQL injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the WordPress server.
*   The attacker needs access to the WordPress control panel and the Booking Calendar plugin page.
*   The vulnerability is exploited by injecting SQL code into the `booking_id` parameter when deleting a booking entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WordPress admin panel.
*   The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the Booking Calendar plugin page.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept the HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs to be able to use tools such as Burp Suite and sqlmap.

**Additional Information:**

*   The `booking_id` parameter is vulnerable to boolean-based blind injection, error-based injection, and time-based injection.
*   The proof of concept shows how to perform a time-based SQL injection using `SLEEP()` function.
*   The exploit can be used with SQLmap tool to obtain a SQL shell, a Linux shell, or a Windows command prompt.
*   The vulnerability was identified on December 28, 2018, and the developer was informed, however, there was no response from the developer by Feb 14, 2019, when this was publicly released.
*   The vulnerability affects version 8.4.3 of the Booking Calendar plugin, and potentially older versions.
*   The recommended remediation is to uninstall the plugin until a patch is released by the developer.
