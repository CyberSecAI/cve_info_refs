```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a command injection in the MailCleaner Community Edition product, specifically within the Logs.php file. The 'filter' parameter is used without proper validation within an operating system command execution flow, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an operating system command.
- Lack of Input Validation: The 'filter' parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the constructed shell command.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web server user, which is root in this case. This allows full control of the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP POST request to /admin/managetracing/search/search with a malicious value in the 'domain' parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable MailCleaner instance.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
