{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The LibVNCClient library, used in SSVNC and iTALC, incorrectly handled certain packet lengths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bound write vulnerability",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability",
      "Improper Initialization vulnerability",
	  "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve several impacts including: obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (DoS), or execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker with network access to the affected systems.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted VNC packets to a vulnerable client or server.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in LibVNCClient which is a VNC client library. This vulnerability is related to other CVEs affecting LibVNCServer, but this vulnerability is specific to the client component of LibVNC. User interaction is required as successful exploitation involves a user connecting to the attacker's VNC server. It should be noted that ssvnc is an enhanced version of the TightVNC client."
