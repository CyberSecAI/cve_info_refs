```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The i-doit CMDB application has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with administrator roles to upload arbitrary files to the main website directory. This is achieved by exploiting a plugin upload mechanism.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unrestricted file upload: The application accepts zip files as plugins and extracts them to the main directory without proper sanitization or validation.
- Insecure file handling: The application does not properly validate the contents of the uploaded zip files, allowing for the inclusion of executable files, such as PHP files.
- Lack of access control: The application does not restrict the ability of administrator-level authenticated users to upload arbitrary files to the main web directory.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Code Execution: By uploading a malicious PHP file within a zip archive, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full system compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the affected server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP POST request to the admin interface.
- Uploading a specially crafted ZIP archive containing a malicious PHP file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Requires an authenticated user with administrator privileges to log into the i-doit admin panel.
- Ability to craft a malicious ZIP archive with a 'package.json' file and a PHP file.
- Access to the target server via HTTP protocol.
