  "CVE-2018-20782": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is present in the GloBee payment gateway plugin for WooCommerce. It stems from a lack of proper verification and cryptographic authentication (like HMAC) of data received through the Instant Payment Notification (IPN) callback. Specifically, the plugin relies on untrusted inputs, allowing a remote, unauthorized attacker to bypass the payment process and spoof the order status.",
    "Root cause": "Reliance on untrusted inputs, insufficient data verification, and the absence of cryptographic authentication at the IPN callback.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs",
      "Insufficient Data Verification",
      "Lack of Cryptographic Authentication (HMAC)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass the payment process, mark an order as paid/completed without actually paying, and spoof order statuses. This can lead to financial loss for the merchant as goods may be shipped without receiving payment.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote, unauthorized attacker can send a crafted POST request to the plugin's IPN callback URL (`/wc-api/globee_ipn_callback`).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know a valid `payment ID` and `order ID`. They can then construct a JSON payload with a `status` field to spoof the payment status."
