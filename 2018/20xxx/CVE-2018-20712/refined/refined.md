{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect advance of the pointer `di` in the `d_expression_1` function within `cp-demangle.c`. The line `d_advance(di, 2)` increments the pointer by 2, which can lead to a heap buffer overflow if there isn't sufficient space after the current position of `di`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault. This could lead to a denial-of-service if an attacker can control the input to the `c++filt` utility.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted ELF input provided to the `c++filt` tool. The command to trigger the vulnerability is `./c++filt -t < $POC`, where `$POC` is a malicious input.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted ELF input to the `c++filt` utility."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was initially reported against binutils but the vulnerable code resides in libiberty, which is maintained by the GCC project. The bug report was moved to the GCC bugzilla. The issue is a regression introduced by commit `ebb8004a18a3808d7197762faf3c5aaeae82371f`."
