## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 904385 918103 922306

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-14625

    A use-after-free bug was found in the vhost driver for the Virtual
    Socket protocol.  If this driver is used to communicate with a
    malicious virtual machine guest, the guest could read sensitive
    information from the host kernel.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000026

    It was discovered that Linux could forward aggregated network
    packets with a segmentation size too large for the output device.
    In the specific case of Broadcom NetXtremeII 10Gb adapters, this
    would result in a denial of service (firmware crash).  This update
    adds a mitigation to the bnx2x driver for this hardware.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

    Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research
    team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP
    implementation.  If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker
    could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-8980

    A bug was discovered in the kernel_read_file() function used to
    load firmware files. In certain error conditions it could leak
    memory, which might lead to a denial of service. This is probbaly
    not exploitable in a Debian system.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#904385, #918103, and #922306; and other fixes included in upstream
stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1663176#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2019-01-03 11:24:43 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of Logical link control and adaptation protocol (L2CAP), part of the bluetooth stack.  An attacker with physical access within the range of standard bluetooth transmission can create a specially crafted packet.  The response to this specially crafted packet can contain part of the kernel stack which can be used in a further attack.  Upstream patch: [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047@kroah.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047%40kroah.com/)  Oss-security post: <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q1/58>  Mitigation:  - Disabling the bluetooth hardware in the bios. - Prevent loading of the bluetooth kernel modules. - Disable the bluetooth connection by putting the system in "airport" mode.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1663176#c5)  Andrej Nemec    2019-01-14 13:04:24 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q1/58>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1663176#c6)  Andrej Nemec    2019-01-14 13:05:43 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1665925](show_bug.cgi?id=1665925 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-3459 CVE-2019-3460 kernel: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1663176#c8)  gopal krishna tiwari    2019-04-17 06:27:48 UTC  ``` Hi Wade/Andrej,   Seems patch for this    [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047@kroah.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190110062833.GA15047%40kroah.com/)  Not yet made it to upstream ?

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3879-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

HID: quirks: fix RetroUSB.com devices
commit 868613f1c0ccf7b832f38b48b18cca31cdeb3d26 upstream.
SNES RetroPort and RetroPad register only 4 gamepad buttons
when they should register all 8 buttons. This is described here:
https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/128102
This is happening because of:
Commit 190d7f02ce8e ("HID: input: do not increment usages when
duplicate is found")
Here, I add the quirk HID\_QUIRK\_INCREMENT\_USAGE\_ON\_DUPLICATE
(created for backward compatibility with the change in 190d7f02ce8e)
for the two products.
Tested with both RetroPort and RetroPad.

mac80211: ignore NullFunc frames in the duplicate detection
commit 990d71846a0b7281bd933c34d734e6afc7408e7e upstream.
NullFunc packets should never be duplicate just like
QoS-NullFunc packets.
We saw a client that enters / exits power save with
NullFunc frames (and not with QoS-NullFunc) despite the
fact that the association supports HT.
This specific client also re-uses a non-zero sequence number
for different NullFunc frames.
At some point, the client had to send a retransmission of
the NullFunc frame and we dropped it, leading to a
misalignment in the power save state.
Fix this by never consider a NullFunc frame as duplicate,
just like we do for QoS NullFunc frames.
This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=201449

mac80211: fix reordering of buffered broadcast packets
commit 9ec1190d065998650fd9260dea8cf3e1f56c0e8c upstream.
If the buffered broadcast queue contains packets, letting new packets bypass
that queue can lead to heavy reordering, since the driver is probably throttling
transmission of buffered multicast packets after beacons.
Keep buffering packets until the buffer has been cleared (and no client
is in powersave mode).

mac80211: Clear beacon\_int in ieee80211\_do\_stop
commit 5c21e8100dfd57c806e833ae905e26efbb87840f upstream.
This fixes stale beacon-int values that would keep a netdev
from going up.
To reproduce:
Create two VAP on one radio.
vap1 has beacon-int 100, start it.
vap2 has beacon-int 240, start it (and it will fail
because beacon-int mismatch).
reconfigure vap2 to have beacon-int 100 and start it.
It will fail because the stale beacon-int 240 will be used
in the ifup path and hostapd never gets a chance to set the
new beacon interval.

cfg80211: Fix busy loop regression in ieee80211\_ie\_split\_ric()
commit 312ca38ddda64bac6513ec68e0ac3789b4eb44dc upstream.
This function was modified to support the information element extension
case (WLAN\_EID\_EXTENSION) in a manner that would result in an infinite
loop when going through set of IEs that include WLAN\_EID\_RIC\_DATA and
contain an IE that is in the after\_ric array. The only place where this
can currently happen is in mac80211 ieee80211\_send\_assoc() where
ieee80211\_ie\_split\_ric() is called with after\_ric[].
This can be triggered by valid data from user space nl80211
association/connect request (i.e., requiring GENL\_UNS\_ADMIN\_PERM). The
only known application having an option to include WLAN\_EID\_RIC\_DATA in
these requests is wpa\_supplicant and it had a bug that prevented this
specific contents from being used (and because of that, not triggering
this kernel bug in an automated test case ap\_ft\_ric) and now that this
bug is fixed, it has a workaround to avoid this kernel issue.
WLAN\_EID\_RIC\_DATA is currently used only for testing purposes, so this
does not cause significant harm for production use cases.

libnvdimm, pfn: Pad pfn namespaces relative to other regions
commit ae86cbfef3818300f1972e52f67a93211acb0e24 upstream.
Commit cfe30b872058 "libnvdimm, pmem: adjust for section collisions with
'System RAM'" enabled Linux to workaround occasions where platform
firmware arranges for "System RAM" and "Persistent Memory" to collide
within a single section boundary. Unfortunately, as reported in this
issue [1], platform firmware can inflict the same collision between
persistent memory regions.
The approach of interrogating iomem\_resource does not work in this
case because platform firmware may merge multiple regions into a single
iomem\_resource range. Instead provide a method to interrogate regions
that share the same parent bus.
This is a stop-gap until the core-MM can grow support for hotplug on
sub-section boundaries.

tty: do not set TTY\_IO\_ERROR flag if console port
commit 2a48602615e0a2f563549c7d5c8d507f904cf96e upstream.
Since Commit 761ed4a94582 ('tty: serial\_core: convert uart\_close to use
tty\_port\_close') and Commit 4dda864d7307 ('tty: serial\_core: Fix serial
console crash on port shutdown), a serial port which is used as
console can be stuck when logging out if there is a remained process.
After logged out, agetty will try to grab the serial port but it will
be failed because the previous process did not release the port
correctly. To fix this, TTY\_IO\_ERROR bit should not be enabled of
tty\_port\_close if the port is console port.
Reproduce step:
- Run background processes from serial console
$ while true; do sleep 10; done &
- Log out
$ logout
-> Stuck
- Read journal log by journalctl | tail

tty: serial: 8250\_mtk: always resume the device in probe.
commit 100bc3e2bebf95506da57cbdf5f26b25f6da4c81 upstream.
serial8250\_register\_8250\_port calls uart\_config\_port, which calls
config\_port on the port before it tries to power on the port. So we need
the port to be on before calling serial8250\_register\_8250\_port. Change
the code to always do a runtime resume in probe before registering port,
and always do a runtime suspend in remove.
This basically reverts the change in commit 68e5fc4a255a ("tty: serial:
8250\_mtk: use pm\_runtime callbacks for enabling"), but still use
pm\_runtime callbacks.

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Offload the handling of channels to two workqueues
commit 37c2578c0c40e286bc0d30bdc05290b2058cf66e upstream.
vmbus\_process\_offer() mustn't call channel->sc\_creation\_callback()
directly for sub-channels, because sc\_creation\_callback() ->
vmbus\_open() may never get the host's response to the
OPEN\_CHANNEL message (the host may rescind a channel at any time,
e.g. in the case of hot removing a NIC), and vmbus\_onoffer\_rescind()
may not wake up the vmbus\_open() as it's blocked due to a non-zero
vmbus\_connection.offer\_in\_progress, and finally we have a deadlock.
The above is also true for primary channels, if the related device
drivers use sync probing mode by default.
And, usually the handling of primary channels and sub-channels can
depend on each other, so we should offload them to different
workqueues to avoid possible deadlock, e.g. in sync-probing mode,
NIC1's netvsc\_subchan\_work() can race with NIC2's netvsc\_probe() ->
rtnl\_lock(), and causes deadlock: the former gets the rtnl\_lock
and waits for all the sub-channels to appear, but the latter
can't get the rtnl\_lock and this blocks the handling of sub-channels.
The patch can fix the multiple-NIC deadlock described above for
v3.x kernels (e.g. RHEL 7.x) which don't support async-probing
of devices, and v4.4, v4.9, v4.14 and v4.18 which support async-probing
but don't enable async-probing for Hyper-V drivers (yet).
The patch can also fix the hang issue in sub-channel's handling described
above for all versions of kernels, including v4.19 and v4.20-rc4.
So actually the patch should be applied to all the existing kernels,
not only the kernels that have 8195b1396ec8.

x86/efi: Allocate e820 buffer before calling efi\_exit\_boot\_service
commit b84a64fad40637b1c9fa4f4dbf847a23e29e672b upstream.
The following commit:
d64934019f6c ("x86/efi: Use efi\_exit\_boot\_services()")
introduced a regression on systems with large memory maps causing them
to hang on boot. The first "goto get\_map" that was removed from
exit\_boot() ensured there was enough room for the memory map when
efi\_call\_early(exit\_boot\_services) was called. This happens when
(nr\_desc > ARRAY\_SIZE(params->e820\_table).
Chain of events:
exit\_boot()
efi\_exit\_boot\_services()
efi\_get\_memory\_map <- at this point the mm can't grow over 8 desc
priv\_func()
exit\_boot\_func()
allocate\_e820ext() <- new mm grows over 8 desc from e820 alloc
efi\_call\_early(exit\_boot\_services) <- mm key doesn't match so retry
efi\_call\_early(get\_memory\_map) <- not enough room for new mm
system hangs
This patch allocates the e820 buffer before calling efi\_exit\_boot\_services()
and fixes the regression.

kprobes/x86: Fix instruction patching corruption when copying more than one RIP-relative instruction
commit 43a1b0cb4cd6dbfd3cd9c10da663368394d299d8 upstream.
After copy\_optimized\_instructions() copies several instructions
to the working buffer it tries to fix up the real RIP address, but it
adjusts the RIP-relative instruction with an incorrect RIP address
for the 2nd and subsequent instructions due to a bug in the logic.
This will break the kernel pretty badly (with likely outcomes such as
a kernel freeze, a crash, or worse) because probed instructions can refer
to the wrong data.
For example putting kprobes on cpumask\_next() typically hits this bug.
cpumask\_next() is normally like below if CONFIG\_CPUMASK\_OFFSTACK=y
(in this case nr\_cpumask\_bits is an alias of nr\_cpu\_ids):
:
48 89 f0 mov %rsi,%rax
8b 35 7b fb e2 00 mov 0xe2fb7b(%rip),%esi # ffffffff82db9e64
55 push %rbp
...
If we put a kprobe on it and it gets jump-optimized, it gets
patched by the kprobes code like this:
:
e9 95 7d 07 1e jmpq 0xffffffffa000207a
7b fb jnp 0xffffffff81f8a2e2
e2 00 loop 0xffffffff81f8a2e9
55 push %rbp
This shows that the first two MOV instructions were copied to a
trampoline buffer at 0xffffffffa000207a.
Here is the disassembled result of the trampoline, skipping
the optprobe template instructions:
# Dump of assembly code from 0xffffffffa000207a to 0xffffffffa00020ea:
54 push %rsp
...
48 83 c4 08 add $0x8,%rsp
9d popfq
48 89 f0 mov %rsi,%rax
8b 35 82 7d db e2 mov -0x1d24827e(%rip),%esi # 0xffffffff82db9e67
This dump shows that the second MOV accesses \*(nr\_cpu\_ids+3) instead of
the original \*nr\_cpu\_ids. This leads to a kernel freeze because
cpumask\_next() always returns 0 and for\_each\_cpu() never ends.
Fix this by adding 'len' correctly to the real RIP address while
copying.

drm/lease: Send a distinct uevent
commit ce85882860f0e756f7066cbda1c43e8b50b73ab6 upstream.
Sending the exact same hotplug event is not great uapi. Luckily the
only already merged implementation of leases (in the -modesetting
driver) doesn't care about what kind of uevent it gets, and
unconditionally processes both hotplug and lease changes. So we can
still adjust the uapi here.
But e.g. weston tries to filter stuff, and I guess others might want
to do that too. Try to make that possible. Cc: stable since it's uapi
adjustement that we want to roll out everywhere.
Michel Dänzer mentioned on irc that -amdgpu also has lease support. It
has the same code flow as -modesetting though, so we can still go
ahead.

arm64: dts: rockchip: remove vdd\_log from rock960 to fix a stability issues
[ Upstream commit 13682e524167cbd7e2a26c5e91bec765f0f96273 ]
When the performance governor is set as default, the rock960 hangs
around one minute after booting, whatever the activity is (idle, key
pressed, loaded, ...).
Based on the commit log found at https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10092377/
"vdd\_log has no consumer and therefore will not be set to a specific
voltage. Still the PWM output pin gets configured and thence the vdd\_log
output voltage will changed from it's default. Depending on the idle
state of the PWM this will slightly over or undervoltage the logic supply
of the RK3399 and cause instability with GbE (undervoltage) and PCIe
(overvoltage). Since the default value set by a voltage divider is the
correct supply voltage and we don't need to change it during runtime we
remove the rail from the devicetree completely so the PWM pin will not
be configured."
After removing the vdd-log from the rock960's specific DT, the board
does no longer hang and shows a stable behavior.
Apply the same change for the rock960 by removing the vdd-log from the
DT.

Don't allow USB3 U1 or U2 if the latency to wake up from the U-state

This is according to xhci 1.1 specification section 4.23.5.2 extra note:
"Software shall ensure that a device is prevented from entering a U-state
where its worst case exit latency approaches the ESIT."
Allowing too long exit latencies for periodic endpoint confuses xHC

commit a7d57abcc8a5bdeb53bbf8e87558e8e0a2c2a29d upstream.
Occasionally AMD SNPS 3.0 xHC does not respond to
CSS when set, also it does not flag anything on SRE and HCE
to point the internal xHC errors on USBSTS register. This stalls
the entire system wide suspend and there is no point in stalling
just because of xHC CSS is not responding.
To work around this problem, if the xHC does not flag
anything on SRE and HCE, we can skip the CSS
timeout and allow the system to continue the suspend. Once the
system resume happens we can internally reset the controller
using XHCI\_RESET\_ON\_RESUME quirk

The arm compiler internally interprets an inline assembly label

which was tripping the runtime checks. Instead, we can just cast the label
(as done with the size calculations earlier).

dmaengine: cppi41: delete channel from pending list when stop channel
commit 59861547ec9a9736e7882f6fb0c096a720ff811a upstream.
The driver defines three states for a cppi channel.
- idle: .chan\_busy == 0 && not in .pending list
- pending: .chan\_busy == 0 && in .pending list
- busy: .chan\_busy == 1 && not in .pending list
There are cases in which the cppi channel could be in the pending state
when cppi41\_dma\_issue\_pending() is called after cppi41\_runtime\_suspend()
is called.
cppi41\_stop\_chan() has a bug for these cases to set channels to idle state.
It only checks the .chan\_busy flag, but not the .pending list, then later
when cppi41\_runtime\_resume() is called the channels in .pending list will
be transitioned to busy state.
Removing channels from the .pending list solves the problem.

dmaengine: imx-sdma: implement channel termination via worker
commit b8603d2a5795c42f78998e70dc792336e0dc20c9 upstream.
The dmaengine documentation states that device\_terminate\_all may be
asynchronous and need not wait for the active transfers to stop.
This allows us to move most of the functionality currently implemented
in the sdma channel termination function to run in a worker, outside
of any atomic context. Moving this out of atomic context has two
benefits: we can now sleep while waiting for the channel to terminate,
instead of busy waiting and the freeing of the dma descriptors happens
with IRQs enabled, getting rid of a warning in the dma mapping code.
As the termination is now async, we need to implement the
device\_synchronize dma engine function which simply waits for the
worker to finish its execution.

commit ebb853b1bd5f659b92c71dc6a9de44cfc37c78c0 upstream.
This reverts commit fe5b85c656bc. The SDMA engine needs the descriptors to
be contiguous in memory. As the dma pool API is only able to provide a
single descriptor per alloc invocation there is no guarantee that multiple
descriptors satisfy this requirement. Also the code in question is broken
as it only allocates memory for a single descriptor, without looking at the
number of descriptors required for the transfer, leading to out-of-bounds
accesses when the descriptors are written.

dmaengine: dw: Fix FIFO size for Intel Merrifield
commit ffe843b18211301ad25893eba09f402c19d12304 upstream.
Intel Merrifield has a reduced size of FIFO used in iDMA 32-bit controller,
i.e. 512 bytes instead of 1024.
Fix this by partitioning it as 64 bytes per channel.
Note, in the future we might switch to 'fifo-size' property instead of
hard coded value.

arm64: hibernate: Avoid sending cross-calling with interrupts disabled
commit b4aecf78083d8c6424657c1746c7c3de6e61669f upstream.
Since commit 3b8c9f1cdfc50 ("arm64: IPI each CPU after invalidating the
I-cache for kernel mappings"), a call to flush\_icache\_range() will use
an IPI to cross-call other online CPUs so that any stale instructions
are flushed from their pipelines. This triggers a WARN during the
hibernation resume path, where flush\_icache\_range() is called with
interrupts disabled and is therefore prone to deadlock:
| Disabling non-boot CPUs ...
| CPU1: shutdown
| psci: CPU1 killed.
| CPU2: shutdown
| psci: CPU2 killed.
| CPU3: shutdown

Since all secondary CPUs have been taken offline prior to invalidating
the I-cache, there's actually no need for an IPI and we can simply call
\_\_flush\_icache\_range() instead.

vhost/vsock: fix use-after-free in network stack callers
commit 834e772c8db0c6a275d75315d90aba4ebbb1e249 upstream.
If the network stack calls .send\_pkt()/.cancel\_pkt() during .release(),
a struct vhost\_vsock use-after-free is possible. This occurs because
.release() does not wait for other CPUs to stop using struct
vhost\_vsock.
Switch to an RCU-enabled hashtable (indexed by guest CID) so that
.release() can wait for other CPUs by calling synchronize\_rcu(). This
also eliminates vhost\_vsock\_lock acquisition in the data path so it
could have a positive effect on performance.
This is CVE-2018-14625 "kernel: use-after-free Read in vhost\_transport\_send\_pkt".

virtio/s390: fix race in ccw\_io\_helper()
commit 78b1a52e05c9db11d293342e8d6d8a230a04b4e7 upstream.
While ccw\_io\_helper() seems like intended to be exclusive in a sense that
it is supposed to facilitate I/O for at most one thread at any given
time, there is actually nothing ensuring that threads won't pile up at
vcdev->wait\_q. If they do, all threads get woken up and see the status
that belongs to some other request than their own. This can lead to bugs.
For an example see:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1788432
This race normally does not cause any problems. The operations provided
by struct virtio\_config\_ops are usually invoked in a well defined
sequence, normally don't fail, and are normally used quite infrequent
too.
Yet, if some of the these operations are directly triggered via sysfs
attributes, like in the case described by the referenced bug, userspace
is given an opportunity to force races by increasing the frequency of the
given operations.
Let us fix the problem by ensuring, that for each device, we finish
processing the previous request before starting with a new one.

Currently we have a race on vcdev->config in virtio\_ccw\_get\_config() and

This normally does not cause problems, as these are usually infrequent

space can be triggered through sysfs attributes. For these, userspace can
force the race by increasing the frequency.

parisc: Enable -ffunction-sections for modules on 32-bit kernel
commit 1e8249b8a4e960018e4baca6b523b8a4500af600 upstream.
Frank Schreiner reported, that since kernel 4.18 he faces sysfs-warnings
when loading modules on a 32-bit kernel. Here is one such example:
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/module/nfs/sections/.text'
CPU: 0 PID: 98 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 4.18.0-2-parisc #1 Debian 4.18.10-2

This warning gets triggered by the fact, that due to commit 24b6c22504a2
("parisc: Build kernel without -ffunction-sections") we now get multiple .text
sections in the kernel modules for which sysfs\_create\_group() can't create
multiple virtual files.
This patch works around the problem by re-enabling the -ffunction-sections
compiler option for modules, while keeping it disabled for the non-module
kernel code.

Revert "mfd: cros\_ec: Use devm\_kzalloc for private data"

This reverts commit 3aa2177e47878f7e7616da8a2050c44f22301b6e.
That commit triggered a new WARN when unloading the module (see at the
end of the commit message). When a class\_dev is embedded in a structure
then that class\_dev is the thing that controls the lifetime of that
structure, for that reason device managed allocations can't be used here.
See Documentation/kobject.txt.
Revert the above patch, so the struct is allocated using kzalloc and we
have a release function for it that frees the allocated memory, otherwise
it is broken.
------------[ cut here ]------------
Device 'cros\_ec' does not have a release() function, it is broken and must be fixed.

commit 3d8e450f517cdb33da77827ec75929354753e9c0 upstream.
Tuners should report frequencies in Hz. That works fine on most
drivers, but, in the case of dvb-pll, some settings are for
satellite tuners, while others are for terrestrial/cable ones.
The code was trying to solve it at probing time, but that doesn't
work, as, when \_attach is called, the delivery system may be wrong.
Fix it by ensuring that all frequencies are in Hz at the per-tuner
max/min values.
While here, add a debug message, as this would help to debug any
issues there.

ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speaker output regression on Thinkpad T570
commit 54947cd64c1b8290f64bb2958e343c07270e3a58 upstream.
We've got a regression report for some Thinkpad models (at least
T570s) which shows the too low speaker output volume. The bisection
leaded to the commit 61fcf8ece9b6 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Enable Thinkpad
Dock device for ALC298 platform"), and it's basically adding the two
pin configurations for the dock, and looks harmless.
The real culprit seems, though, that the DAC assignment for the
speaker pin is implicitly assumed on these devices, i.e. pin NID 0x14
to be coupled with DAC NID 0x03. When more pins are configured by the
commit above, the auto-parser changes the DAC assignment, and this
resulted in the regression.
As a workaround, just provide the fixed pin / DAC mapping table for
this Thinkpad fixup function. It's no generic solution, but the
problem itself is pretty much device-specific, so must be good
enough.

ALSA: pcm: Call snd\_pcm\_unlink() conditionally at closing
commit b51abed8355e5556886623b2772fa6b7598d2282 upstream.
Currently the PCM core calls snd\_pcm\_unlink() always unconditionally
at closing a stream. However, since snd\_pcm\_unlink() invokes the
global rwsem down, the lock can be easily contended. More badly, when
a thread runs in a high priority RT-FIFO, it may stall at spinning.
Basically the call of snd\_pcm\_unlink() is required only for the linked
streams that are already rare occasion. For normal use cases, this
code path is fairly superfluous.
As an optimization (and also as a workaround for the RT problem
above in normal situations without linked streams), this patch adds a
check before calling snd\_pcm\_unlink() and calls it only when needed.

ALSA: pcm: Fix starvation on down\_write\_nonblock()
commit b888a5f713e4d17faaaff24316585a4eb07f35b7 upstream.
Commit 67ec1072b053 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix rwsem deadlock for non-atomic PCM
stream") fixes deadlock for non-atomic PCM stream. But, This patch
causes antother stuck.
If writer is RT thread and reader is a normal thread, the reader
thread will be difficult to get scheduled. It may not give chance to
release readlocks and writer gets stuck for a long time if they are
pinned to single cpu.
The deadlock described in the previous commit is because the linux
rwsem queues like a FIFO. So, we might need non-FIFO writelock, not
non-block one.
My suggestion is that the writer gives reader a chance to be scheduled
by using the minimum msleep() instaed of spinning without blocking by
writer. Also, The \*\_nonblock may be changed to \*\_nonfifo appropriately
to this concept.
In terms of performance, when trylock is failed, this minimum periodic
msleep will have the same performance as the tick-based
schedule()/wake\_up\_q().
[ Although this has a fairly high performance penalty, the relevant
code path became already rare due to the previous commit ("ALSA:
pcm: Call snd\_pcm\_unlink() conditionally at closing"). That is, now
this unconditional msleep appears only when using linked streams,
and this must be a rare case. So we accept this as a quick
workaround until finding a more suitable one -- tiwai ]

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix UAF decrement if card has no live interfaces in card.c
commit 5f8cf712582617d523120df67d392059eaf2fc4b upstream.
If a USB sound card reports 0 interfaces, an error condition is triggered
and the function usb\_audio\_probe errors out. In the error path, there was a
use-after-free vulnerability where the memory object of the card was first
freed, followed by a decrement of the number of active chips. Moving the
decrement above the atomic\_dec fixes the UAF.

USB: serial: console: fix reported terminal settings
commit f51ccf46217c28758b1f3b5bc0ccfc00eca658b2 upstream.
The USB-serial console implementation has never reported the actual
terminal settings used. Despite storing the corresponding cflags in its
struct console, these were never honoured on later tty open() where the
tty termios would be left initialised to the driver defaults.
Unlike the serial console implementation, the USB-serial code calls
subdriver open() already at console setup. While calling set\_termios()
and write() before open() looks like it could work for some USB-serial
drivers, others definitely do not expect this, so modelling this after
serial core is going to be intrusive, if at all possible.
Instead, use a (renamed) tty helper to save the termios data used at
console setup so that the tty termios reflects the actual terminal
settings after a subsequent tty open().
Note that the calls to tty\_init\_termios() (tty\_driver\_install()) and
tty\_save\_termios() are serialised using the disconnect mutex.
This specifically fixes a regression that was triggered by a recent
change adding software flow control to the pl2303 driver: a getty trying
to disable flow control while leaving the baud rate unchanged would now
also set the baud rate to the driver default (prior to the flow-control
change this had been a noop).

usb: quirk: add no-LPM quirk on SanDisk Ultra Flair device
commit 2f2dde6ba89b1ef1fe23c1138131b315d9aa4019 upstream.
Some lower volume SanDisk Ultra Flair in 16GB, which the VID:PID is
in 0781:5591, will aggressively request LPM of U1/U2 during runtime,
when using this thumb drive as the OS installation key we found the
device will generate failure during U1 exit path making it dropped
from the USB bus, this causes a corrupted installation in system at
the end.

...
Analyzed the USB trace in the link layer we realized it is because
of the 6-ms timer of tRecoveryConfigurationTimeout which documented
on the USB 3.2 Revision 1.0, the section 7.5.10.4.2 of "Exit from
Recovery.Configuration"; device initiates U1 exit -> Recovery.Active
-> Recovery.Configuration, then the host timer timeout makes the link
transits to eSS.Inactive -> Rx.Detect follows by a Warm Reset.
Interestingly, the other higher volume of SanDisk Ultra Flair sharing
the same VID:PID, such as 64GB, would not request LPM during runtime,
it sticks at U0 always, thus disabling LPM does not affect those thumb
drives at all.
The same odd occures in SanDisk Ultra Fit 16GB, VID:PID in 0781:5583.

team: no need to do team\_notify\_peers or team\_mcast\_rejoin when disabling port
[ Upstream commit 5ed9dc99107144f83b6c1bb52a69b58875baf540 ]
team\_notify\_peers() will send ARP and NA to notify peers. team\_mcast\_rejoin()
will send multicast join group message to notify peers. We should do this when
enabling/changed to a new port. But it doesn't make sense to do it when a port
is disabled.
On the other hand, when we set mcast\_rejoin\_count to 2, and do a failover,
team\_port\_disable() will increase mcast\_rejoin.count\_pending to 2 and then
team\_port\_enable() will increase mcast\_rejoin.count\_pending to 4. We will send
4 mcast rejoin messages at latest, which will make user confused. The same
with notify\_peers.count.
Fix it by deleting team\_notify\_peers() and team\_mcast\_rejoin() in
team\_port\_disable().

[ Upstream commit 426a593e641ebf0d9288f0a2fcab644a86820220 ]
In the original ftmac100\_interrupt(), the interrupts are only disabled when
the condition "netif\_running(netdev)" is true. However, this condition
causes kerenl hang in the following case. When the user requests to
disable the network device, kernel will clear the bit \_\_LINK\_STATE\_START
from the dev->state and then call the driver's ndo\_stop function. Network
device interrupts are not blocked during this process. If an interrupt
occurs between clearing \_\_LINK\_STATE\_START and stopping network device,
kernel cannot disable the interrupts due to the condition
"netif\_running(netdev)" in the ISR. Hence, kernel will hang due to the
continuous interruption of the network device.
In order to solve the above problem, the interrupts of the network device
should always be disabled in the ISR without being restricted by the
condition "netif\_running(netdev)".

returned PQ 0, which can potentially be another function's pq. Verify
that flag is enabled, otherwise return default start\_pq.
- When qed\_init\_qm\_get\_idx\_from\_flags() receives an unknown flag, it
returned NULL and could lead to a segmentation fault. Return default
start\_pq instead.
- A modulo operation was added to MCOS/VFS PQ getters to make sure the
PQ returned is in range of the required flag.

This reverts commit 336fd4f5f25157e9e8bd50e898a1bbcd99eaea46.
Please note that `strlcpy()` does \*NOT\* do what you think it does.
strlcpy() \*ALWAYS\* reads the full input string, regardless of the
'length' parameter. That is, if the input is not zero-terminated,
strlcpy() will \*READ\* beyond input boundaries. It does this, because it
always returns the size it \*would\* copy if the target was big enough,
not the truncated size it actually copied.
The original code was perfectly fine. The hid device is
zero-initialized and the strncpy() functions copied up to n-1
characters. The result is always zero-terminated this way.
This is the third time someone tried to replace strncpy with strlcpy in
this function, and gets it wrong. I now added a comment that should at
least make people reconsider.

cpufreq: ti-cpufreq: Only register platform\_device when supported
[ Upstream commit d98ccfc3948ab63152494bb6b9c17e15295c0310 ]
Currently the ti-cpufreq driver blindly registers a 'ti-cpufreq' to force
the driver to probe on any platforms where the driver is built in.
However, this should only happen on platforms that actually can make use
of the driver. There is already functionality in place to match the
SoC compatible so let's factor this out into a separate call and
make sure we find a match before creating the ti-cpufreq platform device.

gpio: pxa: fix legacy non pinctrl aware builds again
[ Upstream commit 70cdb6ad6dc342d9643a00c9092e88f0075f2b9a ]
As pointed out by Gregor, spitz keyboard matrix is broken, with or
without CONFIG\_PINCTRL set, quoting :
"The gpio matrix keypard on the Zaurus C3x00 (see spitz.c) does not work
properly. Noticeable are that rshift+c does nothing where as lshift+c
creates C. Opposite it is for rshift+a vs lshift+a, here only rshift
works. This affects a few other combinations using the rshift or lshift
buttons."
As a matter of fact, as for platform\_data based builds CONFIG\_PINCTRL=n
is required for now (as opposed for devicetree builds where it should be
set), this means gpio driver should change the direction, which is what
was attempted by commit c4e5ffb6f224 ("gpio: pxa: fix legacy non pinctrl
aware builds").
Unfortunately, the input case was inverted, and the direction change was
never done. This wasn't seen up until now because the initial platform
setup (MFP) was setting this direction. Yet in Gregory's case, the
matrix-keypad driver changes back and forth the direction dynamically,
and this is why he's the first to report it.

net/mlx4\_core: Zero out lkey field in SW2HW\_MPT fw command
[ Upstream commit bd85fbc2038a1bbe84990b23ff69b6fc81a32b2c ]
When re-registering a user mr, the mpt information for the
existing mr when running SRIOV is obtained via the QUERY\_MPT
fw command. The returned information includes the mpt's lkey.
This retrieved mpt information is used to move the mpt back
to hardware ownership in the rereg flow (via the SW2HW\_MPT
fw command when running SRIOV).
The fw API spec states that for SW2HW\_MPT, the lkey field
must be zero. Any ConnectX-3 PF driver which checks for strict spec
adherence will return failure for SW2HW\_MPT if the lkey field is not
zero (although the fw in practice ignores this field for SW2HW\_MPT).
Thus, in order to conform to the fw API spec, set the lkey field to zero
before invoking SW2HW\_MPT when running SRIOV.

drm/amd/display: Support amdgpu "max bpc" connector property (v2)
[ Upstream commit 07e3a1cfb0568b6d8d7862077029af96af6690ea ]
[Why]
Many panels support more than 8bpc but some modes are unavailable while
running at greater than 8bpc due to DP/HDMI bandwidth constraints.
Support for more than 8bpc was added recently in the driver but it
defaults to the maximum supported bpc - locking out these modes.
This should be a user configurable option such that the user can select
what bpc configuration they would like.
[How]
This patch adds support for getting and setting the amdgpu driver
specific "max bpc" property on the connector.
It also adds support for limiting the output bpc based on the property
value. The default limitation is the lowest value in the range, 8bpc.
This was the old value before the range was uncapped.
This patch should be updated/replaced later once common drm support
for max bpc lands.

[How]
This patch introduces the "max bpc" amdgpu driver specific connector

nvme-fc: resolve io failures during connect
[ Upstream commit 4cff280a5fccf6513ed9e895bb3a4e7ad8b0cedc ]
If an io error occurs on an io issued while connecting, recovery
of the io falls flat as the state checking ends up nooping the error
handler.
Create an err\_work work item that is scheduled upon an io error while
connecting. The work thread terminates all io on all queues and marks
the queues as not connected. The termination of the io will return
back to the callee, which will then back out of the connection attempt
and will reschedule, if possible, the connection attempt.
The changes:
- in case there are several commands hitting the error handler, a
state flag is kept so that the error work is only scheduled once,
on the first error. The subsequent errors can be ignored.
- The calling sequence to stop keep alive and terminate the queues
and their io is lifted from the reset routine. Made a small
service routine used by both reset and err\_work.
- During debugging, found that the teardown path can reference
an uninitialized pointer, resulting in a NULL pointer oops.
The aen\_ops weren't initialized yet. Add validation on their
initialization before calling the teardown routine.

For this reason, we move the allocation of the rdma\_info structure to be
similar to the iscsi/fcoe info structures which are allocated during device
setup.
We add a new field of "active" to the struct to define whether roce has
already been started or not, and this is checked instead of whether the

bnx2x: Assign unique DMAE channel number for FW DMAE transactions.
[ Upstream commit 77e461d14ed141253573eeeb4d34eccc51e38328 ]
Driver assigns DMAE channel 0 for FW as part of START\_RAMROD command. FW
uses this channel for DMAE operations (e.g., TIME\_SYNC implementation).
Driver also uses the same channel 0 for DMAE operations for some of the PFs
(e.g., PF0 on Port0). This could lead to concurrent access to the DMAE
channel by FW and driver which is not legal. Hence need to assign unique
DMAE id for FW.
Currently following DMAE channels are used by the clients,
MFW - OCBB/OCSD functionality uses DMAE channel 14/15
Driver 0-3 and 8-11 (for PF dmae operations)
4 and 12 (for stats requests)
Assigning unique dmae\_id '13' to the FW.

batman-adv: Expand merged fragment buffer for full packet
[ Upstream commit d7d8bbb40a5b1f682ee6589e212934f4c6b8ad60 ]
The complete size ("total\_size") of the fragmented packet is stored in the
fragment header and in the size of the fragment chain. When the fragments
are ready for merge, the skbuff's tail of the first fragment is expanded to
have enough room after the data pointer for at least total\_size. This means
that it gets expanded by total\_size - first\_skb->len.
But this is ignoring the fact that after expanding the buffer, the fragment
header is pulled by from this buffer. Assuming that the tailroom of the
buffer was already 0, the buffer after the data pointer of the skbuff is
now only total\_size - len(fragment\_header) large. When the merge function
is then processing the remaining fragments, the code to copy the data over
to the merged skbuff will cause an skb\_over\_panic when it tries to actually
put enough data to fill the total\_size bytes of the packet.
The size of the skb\_pull must therefore also be taken into account when the
buffer's tailroom is expanded.

The announcement messages of batman-adv COMPAT\_VERSION 15 have the
possibility to announce additional information via a dynamic TVLV part.
This part is optional for the ELP packets and currently not parsed by the
Linux implementation. Still out-of-tree versions are using it to transport
things like neighbor hashes to optimize the rebroadcast behavior.
Since the ELP broadcast packets are smaller than the minimal ethernet
packet, it often has to be padded. This is often done (as specified in
RFC894) with octets of zero and thus work perfectly fine with the TVLV
part (making it a zero length and thus empty). But not all ethernet
compatible hardware seems to follow this advice. To avoid ambiguous
situations when parsing the TVLV header, just force the 4 bytes (TVLV
length + padding) after the required ELP header to zero.

HID: input: Ignore battery reported by Symbol DS4308
[ Upstream commit 0fd791841a6d67af1155a9c3de54dea51220721e ]
The Motorola/Zebra Symbol DS4308-HD is a handheld USB barcode scanner
which does not have a battery, but reports one anyway that always has
capacity 2.
Let's apply the IGNORE quirk to prevent it from being treated like a
power supply so that userspaces don't get confused that this
accessory is almost out of power and warn the user that they need to charge
their wired barcode scanner.

In the case where eq->fw->size > PAGE\_SIZE the error return rc
is being set to EINVAL however this is being overwritten to
rc = req->fw->size because the error exit path via label 'out' is
not being taken. Fix this by adding the jump to the error exit

scsi: ufs: Fix hynix ufs bug with quirk on hi36xx SoC
[ Upstream commit 8e4829c6f7470722c1f5a1dc5769ebe09ef036d6 ]
Hynix ufs has deviations on hi36xx platform which will result in ufs bursts
transfer failures.
To fix the problem, the Hynix device must set the register
VS\_DebugSaveConfigTime to 0x10, which will set time reference for
SaveConfigTime is 250 ns. The time reference for SaveConfigTime is 40 ns by
default.
This patch is necessary to boot on HiKey960 boards that use Hynix UFS chips
(H28U62301AMR model: hB8aL1).

mt76: fix building without CONFIG\_LEDS\_CLASS

When CONFIG\_LEDS\_CLASS is disabled, or it is a loadable module while
mt76 is built-in, we run into a link error:

We don't really need a hard dependency here as the driver can presumably
work just fine without LEDs, so this follows the iwlwifi example and
adds a separate Kconfig option for the LED support, this will be available
whenever it will link, and otherwise the respective code gets left out from
the driver object.

During the configuration phase of a CEC adapter it is trying to claim a

However, the code doesn't check if there were errors other than OK or NACK,
those are just treated as if the poll was NACKed.
Instead check for such errors and retry the poll. And if the problem persists
then don't claim this LA since there is something weird going on.
