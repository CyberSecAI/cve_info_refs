The provided content describes a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Tenda, Dlink & Tplink TD-W8961ND ADSL2+ Modem Routers. However, the CVE ID mentioned in the text is CVE-2018-20372 and CVE-2018-20373, which indicates that this content is related to the requested CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the DHCP hostnames, within the router's web interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Persistent XSS vulnerability is present in the DHCP client list module where hostnames are displayed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
    *   Persistent manipulation of the affected web module's context
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attack vector involves manipulating the DHCP hostname input field by injecting XSS payloads.
    *   The malicious code is stored and executed when the DHCP client list is viewed.
    *   Attackers can use POST requests to manipulate DHCP hostname listings and client views.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires low privilege access to the router's web interface.
    *   Low user interaction is required for the exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all models with firmware v1.x on the web GUI.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a malicious script by modifying the DHCP hostname and saving it. The script is executed when viewing the DHCP client list.
*   The provided bash script shows how to change the name of DHCP hostnames to an XSS payload.
*   The vulnerability can be fixed by securely parsing the hostnames and disallowing special characters to prevent injection.
