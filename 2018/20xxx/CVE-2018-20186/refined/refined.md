The provided content relates to CVE-2018-20186.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input MP4 file that causes an out-of-memory error during the processing of the file in Bento4's `mp42hls` tool. Specifically, the `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer` function attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory (2147495936 bytes), which fails and leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-memory vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking or validation of the size of memory to be allocated, leading to an attempt to allocate an excessively large amount of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The program crashes due to a failed memory allocation, preventing it from processing the malicious input.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted MP4 file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to the `mp42hls` tool.
