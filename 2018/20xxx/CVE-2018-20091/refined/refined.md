**Verification:**

1.  The content directly mentions `CVE-2018-20091` in the section titled "TSB-349: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Cloudera Data Science Workbench".

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** An SQL injection vulnerability exists in Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW). This vulnerability arises from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   SQL Injection: Failure to properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided input when constructing SQL queries allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied data before using it in SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Database Access:** An authenticated user can execute arbitrary SQL queries against CDSW's internal database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges within CDSW, potentially gaining root access to CDSW nodes, Kubernetes, and the underlying Linux host.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious users could create, modify, delete, and exfiltrate data, code, and credentials stored within the CDSW database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability could be exploited to cause denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Data Loss:** Potential for data loss due to unauthorized modifications or deletion.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** Over the network, as the injection occurs via an authenticated web request
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of Cloudera Data Science Workbench.
    *   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability allows access to sensitive data stored in CDSW's internal database such as user contact information, bcrypt-hashed CDSW passwords, API keys, and Kerberos keytabs.
*   Cloudera recommends a full system upgrade to CDSW 1.4.3.
*   A remediation script was provided to reset passwords, regenerate keys, and reset secrets.

In summary, this CVE describes a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Cloudera Data Science Workbench. The vulnerability could lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, privilege escalations, and denial-of-service attacks.
