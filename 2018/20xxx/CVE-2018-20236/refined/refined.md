Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in Sourcetree for Windows due to how it handles URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate URI inputs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- URI Handling: The vulnerability specifically arises from the way Sourcetree parses and processes URIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URI: An attacker crafts a malicious URI that, when opened by a user with a vulnerable version of Sourcetree, triggers the command injection vulnerability.
- Remote Attack: The attacker can send the malicious URI remotely to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send a malicious URI to the victim.
- The victim needs to be using a vulnerable version of Sourcetree for Windows (versions before 3.0.10).
- No special privileges are required by the attacker on the victim's system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as critical severity.
- Affected versions of Sourcetree for Windows are before 3.0.10.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.10 and later.
- The advisory mentions that this issue was reported by Terry Zhang (pnig0s) at Tophant.
