{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2018-20219",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The device uses a hardcoded authentication token after successful login.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hardcoded authentication token",
      "Insufficient resolution of the vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the device's web administration panel without needing the password.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By setting a specific cookie in a browser"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the hardcoded authentication token.",
        "additional_information": "The initial fix replaced the hardcoded token with a token generated from the current time in seconds, which is still easily bypassable by knowing the approximate time of the last successful authentication."
