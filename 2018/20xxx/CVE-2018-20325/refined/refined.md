{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `_load` method in `parser.py` is vulnerable to arbitrary python code execution due to insecure handling of YAML input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The parser uses `yaml.load` without using the `safe_load` function leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary Python commands on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious YAML file with embedded python code and pass it to the vulnerable `_load` method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious YAML file to the vulnerable `_load` method."
