# URL rel attribute not set for broken URLs

### Summary

There seems to be a minor bug where the `rel` attribute isn't set for some URLs in a Markdown field. I believe this has been abused by spammers in the past for PageRank / similar purposes. I don't believe there are immediate security implications, but you want want to consider fixing this nonetheless.

### Steps to reproduce

* <http://google.com>
* [http://google.com\](http://google.com%5C)
* [http://google.com/"--](http://google.com/%22--)

Inspect the URLs above. You'll notice that the `rel` attribute is only set for the first URL.
