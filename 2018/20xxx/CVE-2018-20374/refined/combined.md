```

Dear all,

```
While fuzzing tcc, a segmentation violation was found in the
use\_section1 function.
```

```
Attached are a file producing a crash when compiled, the output of the
clang address sanitizer and valgrind.
```

There are multiple inputs leading to the same crash,
they are included in the attached file as comments.

To reproduce, compile the attached input file with tcc

    tcc use_section1-oob-write.c

```
The latest git version of tcc (commit
c4787e3626904fc542bd640cc368a9d306347008) was tested.
```
