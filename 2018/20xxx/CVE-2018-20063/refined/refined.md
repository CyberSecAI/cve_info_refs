Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Unrestricted file upload functionality in Gurock's TestRail. The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of file types and extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded. This allows an attacker to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, which can be executed by the web server.
-   **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The application does not properly validate the file extension. This means that even if a file is initially uploaded with a safe extension, an attacker can intercept the request and change the extension to something executable like `.php`.
- **Potentially Accessible Upload Directory:** If the file upload directory is accessible by web server configuration, uploaded files can be directly executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious code (e.g., a PHP file containing `phpinfo()`), an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
-   **Server Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete compromise of the web server.
-   **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  An attacker could potentially use the compromised server to access sensitive data or manipulate the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of TestRail, specifically the file upload functionality.
-   **File Upload Modification:** The attack involves intercepting the file upload request and modifying the file extension to an executable type.
-   **Direct File Access:** Exploitation relies on being able to access the uploaded file via a web browser to trigger execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **TestRail User Account:** The attacker needs a user account with the ability to create a section, test, or other entity where a picture can be uploaded.
-   **Network Interception Capabilities:**  The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify web requests to change file extensions during the upload process.
- **Potentially Administrative Access:** In some scenarios, administrative access might be required to change the upload directory to a publicly accessible location on the webserver.
