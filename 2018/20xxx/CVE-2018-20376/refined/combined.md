```

Dear all,

```
An out of bounds write in the asm\_parse\_directive function was found
while fuzzing tcc.
```

```
You can find the input producing the crash and the output of the clang
address sanitizer and valgrind in the attachments.
The input file contains four lines, each of which triggered the bug on
my system.
```

The ASAN output was generated on an older version of Ubuntu (16.04),
but I could also reproduce the crashes on a current Arch Linux.

To reproduce, compile the attached input file with tcc

    tcc asm_parse-oob_write.c

```
I tested the latest git version of tcc (commit
c4787e3626904fc542bd640cc368a9d306347008).
```
