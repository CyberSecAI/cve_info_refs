- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Specially crafted queries using compound indexes can cause an invariant failure in the `indexedOr` function within the QueryPlanner, leading to a `mongod` crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the query planning logic, specifically how it handles certain queries with compound indexes. An unexpected status code or return value related to the `indexedOr` function causes an invariant failure. This corresponds to CWE-394: Unexpected Status Code or Return Value.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the `mongod` process. This can interrupt database services.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious user with database query privileges sending specially crafted queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to perform database queries. The specific crafted queries are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
