The provided content describes a vulnerability in s-cms related to arbitrary file download, but not related to the specified CVE.

The vulnerability is located in the `admin/download.php` file. It allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server, bypassing a weak protection against PHP file downloads.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `download.php` file when handling the `DownName` parameter, which is used to specify the file to download.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Authentication bypass:** The script uses a `LIKE` operator instead of `=` when verifying user cookies, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication by setting both `user` and `pass` cookies to `%`.
-   **Inadequate file extension filtering:** The code checks for ".php" in the filename, but is case-sensitive, allowing bypass by using ".Php".
-   **Direct file access:** The application directly uses user-supplied input to construct the file path without proper sanitization, potentially allowing access to sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download any file on the server that the webserver process has permissions to read by manipulating the `DownName` parameter. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information like source code, configuration files, or database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `DownName` parameter.
-   **Cookie manipulation**: An attacker must set the `user` and `pass` cookies to `%` to bypass authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `download.php` endpoint.
-   The attacker needs to be able to set cookies.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   The script checks for valid admin credentials using a SQL query like:
        ```sql
        select * from SL_admin where A_login like '".filter_keyword($_COOKIE["user"])."' and A_pwd like '".filter_keyword($_COOKIE["pass"])."'
        ```
    *   Due to using `LIKE` and not `=`, an attacker can set both `user` and `pass` cookies to `%`, resulting in a query like:
        ```sql
        select * from SL_admin where A_login like '%' and A_pwd like '%'
        ```
        This query will return the first admin user, thus bypassing login authentication.
2.  **Arbitrary File Download:**
    *   The `DownName` parameter from the GET request is used to specify the file path:
        ```php
        $DownName=$_GET["DownName"];
        ```
    *   The code attempts to prevent download of php files, but the check is case sensitive:
         ```php
        if(strpos($DownName,".php")!==false){
            die("禁止下载PHP格式文件！");
        }
        ```
    *   The file is then accessed directly using the provided path:
         ```php
        $file_path=$file_name;
        if(!file_exists($file_path))
            {
            echo "下载文件不存在！";
            exit;
        }
        $fp=fopen($file_path,"r");
        ```
    *   An attacker can then download arbitrary files using a path such as `../config.php` with a crafted cookie.
