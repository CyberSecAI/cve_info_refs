  "CVE-2018-20699": {
    "description": "Docker Engine before 18.09 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (dockerd memory consumption) via a large integer in a --cpuset-mems or --cpuset-cpus value, related to daemon/daemon_unix.go, pkg/parsers/parsers.go, and pkg/sysinfo/sysinfo.go.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ParseUintList()` function in `pkg/parsers/parsers.go` is used to parse the `--cpuset-mems` and `--cpuset-cpus` options. This function returns a map with each element in the list mapped to true/false. When a large list (e.g. a large integer range) is provided as input, the daemon tries to allocate the large map, which results in memory exhaustion and denial of service.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory exhaustion due to uncontrolled resource allocation",
        "Lack of input validation for `--cpuset-mems` and `--cpuset-cpus` options"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service by crashing the dockerd daemon due to memory exhaustion",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Specifying a large integer range in the `--cpuset-mems` or `--cpuset-cpus` arguments when creating or updating containers."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to run docker commands, which typically requires root privileges or high-level API access through docker plugins.",
       "additional_details": "The issue is related to the parsing of user provided data for `cpuset` related parameters which are not well validated, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service by requesting memory allocation that leads to exhausting memory resources"
