Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20586:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the RPC interface, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary messages into the debug log of Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin-Qt.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated RPC Access:** The primary weakness is that the RPC interface allows unauthenticated access to certain functionalities, specifically logging.
- **Debug log injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary messages in the debug log file, making it a vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Deception:** The injected log messages could be used to mislead users or administrators, potentially hiding malicious activity or creating false alarms. The injected logs could be crafted to obscure other security issues or make other actions look like they are part of expected behavior.
- The impact is categorized as "Deception" on the provided table, but it could also be used for information gathering or denial of service by filling the log file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **RPC Interface:** Attackers exploit the RPC interface, specifically the lack of authentication for logging-related functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **RPC Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make RPC calls to the targeted Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin-Qt instance. This could be achieved if the RPC interface is exposed on the network without proper access control or if the attacker has access to the local machine.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability affects Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin-Qt versions prior to 0.17.1.
