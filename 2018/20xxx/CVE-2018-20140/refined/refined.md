Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-20140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the search functionality of ZenPhoto 1.4.14. Specifically, the application failed to encode HTML entities in several search parameters before rendering them in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist due to the failure to sanitize user input in the following POST parameters:
*   `SEARCH_state`
*   `SEARCH_country`
*   `SEARCH_city`
*   `SEARCH_title`
*   `SEARCH_desc`
*   `SEARCH_location`
*   `SEARCH_tags`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. This code would then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the search results. This could lead to:
*   Stealing cookies/session information
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   Defacing the website
*  Potentially more severe impacts depending on the application

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the ZenPhoto application. Attackers can insert malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable POST parameters listed above.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable ZenPhoto instance.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials.
*  The attacker needs to trick the victim into loading/interacting with the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Zekvan Arslan using the Invicti Web Application Security Scanner.
*   The issue has been fixed by the vendor.
*   The fix involved encoding the search parameter values with `html_encode()` before displaying them on the page, preventing the execution of injected JavaScript.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a 'Medium' severity.
*   The CVSS v3 score is  CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
