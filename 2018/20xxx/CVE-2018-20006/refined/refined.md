Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `title` parameter when saving a "book" entry. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `title` parameter, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. The injected malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected entry (in this case, when hovering the mouse over a message).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Administrator Cookie Theft:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser session. This allows the attacker to steal the administrator's cookie (`admin_auth`), potentially gaining full administrative access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a POST request to the `/api.php?c=post&f=save` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `title` parameter.
  - **User Interaction:** The stored XSS is triggered when an administrator logs in and views the affected entry, typically by moving the mouse over the message or a part of the UI that displays the title field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs the ability to submit data to the `/api.php?c=post&f=save` endpoint, which likely requires minimal privileges, depending on the application's access control.
  - The attacker does not require administrator privileges to inject the malicious code. They can use a low privileged account or even an unauthenticated request if the vulnerability permits.
  - The attacker needs the administrator to view the stored malicious code in the application's admin panel, in order for the payload to execute.

**Payload Example:** `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

This payload injects an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event that executes `alert(document.cookie)`. In a real attack, a more sophisticated payload to steal cookies or perform other malicious actions would likely be used.
