The content relates to CVE-2018-20777.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the snippet editing functionality of FrogCMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input, which leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie stealing, redirection to malicious websites, and other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the snippet editing functionality in the FrogCMS admin interface, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a snippet's body field. The code is then rendered on other pages using the vulnerable snippet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have access to the admin panel of the FrogCMS and the ability to edit snippets to inject the malicious JavaScript code.
