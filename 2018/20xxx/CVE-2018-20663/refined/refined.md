The content is related to CVE-2018-20663.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Name" field of a report, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks due to the lack of input sanitization or output encoding of the report name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view or interact with the report.
- This can lead to stealing user credentials, session hijacking, or further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the application's report creation feature and input the malicious code in the "Name" field.
- When another user views the report's details or hovers over the tab, the injected JavaScript code will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the application with the ability to create reports.
