**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content **does not mention CVE-2018-20339 or any other CVE with a similar number**. Instead, it refers to a different vulnerability with id **CVE-2024-5466**. It explicitly states that a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability could be exploited by users with 'Write' access to the 'Deploy Agent' action in the UI. This has been fixed in the mentioned version.  Since the provided content does not related to CVE-2018-20339, I respond with **UNRELATED**.
