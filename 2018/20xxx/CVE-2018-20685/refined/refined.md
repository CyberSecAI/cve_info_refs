  "CVE-2018-20685": {
    "description": "In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.",
    "root_cause": "The scp client does not properly validate filenames received from the server, allowing it to be tricked into modifying permissions of the target directory by using an empty or dot directory name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Incorrect Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote SSH servers can bypass intended access restrictions and modify the permissions of the target directory on the client side.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious or compromised SSH server or a Man-in-the-Middle attacker. The attacker would need to control the SSH server the client connects to.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of validation in the scp client when handling filenames from the server. By providing a filename consisting of a dot or an empty filename, a malicious server can cause the scp client to modify target directory permissions.  This was fixed upstream by disallowing empty filenames and filenames that refer to the current directory"
