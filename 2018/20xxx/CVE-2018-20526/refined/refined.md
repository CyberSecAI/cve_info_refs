Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-20526:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `upload.php` file of Roxy Fileman, where insufficient checks are performed on uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files with arbitrary extensions. Specifically, a file with a double extension like `shellcode.php.png` can be uploaded. When the server is configured to process PHP files using a directive like `AddHandler php7-script .php`, the uploaded file is executed as PHP code even with the appended `.png` extension.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell), an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a specific HTTP POST request to the `upload.php` endpoint with a malicious file using `multipart/form-data`.
*   The attacker needs to specify the destination directory in the POST request, within the "d" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Roxy Fileman instance.
*   **No Authentication:** Based on the provided exploit, it does not appear that authentication is needed for a successful exploit.
* **PHP Server Configuration:** The exploit requires specific server configuration, specifically the `AddHandler php7-script .php` directive in the `php.ini` configuration file.
