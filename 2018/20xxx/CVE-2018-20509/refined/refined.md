Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `print_binder_ref_olocked` function in the `drivers/android/binder.c` file of the Linux kernel. This function, when called, outputs sensitive address information within the debugfs file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive memory addresses via the debugfs file. This falls under CWE-200 (Information Exposure).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to obtain potentially sensitive address information. This could be used in further attacks to bypass security mechanisms or obtain more sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system on which the vulnerable kernel is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the target system.
- **Access to debugfs:** The attacker also needs to be able to read the relevant debugfs file to access the leaked information.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Kernel Version**: The vulnerability specifically affects Linux kernel version 4.14.90.
*   **NetApp Products:** NetApp identifies several of their products as affected including "Cluster Network Switch (NetApp CN1610)", "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node", and "SnapProtect".
*   **NetApp Remediation**: NetApp provides fixes for "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node", but declares "SnapProtect" and "Cluster Network Switch (NetApp CN1610)" as "won't fix" with references to End of Availability (EOA) announcements. Workarounds are provided for Active IQ Performance Analytics Services.
*   **CVSS Score**: The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.5 (Medium), with the vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`. This indicates a local attack, low complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction, and a high impact on confidentiality.
