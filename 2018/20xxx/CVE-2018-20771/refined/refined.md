The provided document is a security bulletin from Xerox detailing multiple vulnerabilities fixed in specific software releases for various WorkCentre and Phaser printer models. While the bulletin doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2018-20771, it lists several vulnerabilities that are often associated with CVEs. It is highly probable that one of the issues addressed is CVE-2018-20771.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described, which are likely related to the unspecified CVE:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTTP Security Header Not Detected:** This indicates a lack of security headers in the HTTP responses, potentially leading to clickjacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other attacks.
*   **HTTP Header missing:** Similar to the above, this points to missing headers, which could lead to various security issues like cache poisoning or other exploits by setting or modifying headers to malicious values.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** A vulnerability that allows an attacker to include local files on the server through the web application. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or even remote code execution in some scenarios.
*   **Remote Command Execution (authenticated):**  Allows an attacker with valid credentials to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*    **Remote Command Execution (unauthenticated):** A more severe version of the above. It allows an attacker without valid credentials to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Writable file to Execute PHP code:** Indicates that an attacker can write data to a file, and the application can be tricked into executing this malicious code.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to inject SQL code without seeing the results, potentially leading to data extraction or modification.
*  **Cross frame scripting:** This is a type of XSS attack that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into an iframe, which is used to embed another webpage into another webpage, in order to perform malicious activity.
*   **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** A vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate HTTP parameters in order to bypass security mechanisms or cause other unexpected behavior.
*   **Weak SSL certificate:** Indicates the use of weak or outdated SSL certificate configuration, making communication vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*  **SSL Certificate Hostname Discrepancy:** Indicates the hostname in the certificate does not match the hostname used in the connection, which can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root causes are diverse, stemming from insecure coding practices, insufficient input validation, misconfigurations, and outdated software components (like the usage of OpenSSL 1.0.2h).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
*   Information disclosure (sensitive files, database content)
*   Remote command execution (full system compromise)
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks (compromised communication)
*   Defacement of web interfaces
*   Denial of service
*  Compromising user data through the web interface, and via server-side access.
* Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities through network connections (HTTP requests).
*   **Web Interface:** Most vulnerabilities listed are related to the web interface of the printer.
*   **Malicious input:** Injecting malicious data through HTTP requests, or through file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For **authenticated remote command execution**, the attacker needs valid credentials.
*   For **unauthenticated remote command execution,** the attacker doesn't need valid credentials, making it more severe.
*   Other vulnerabilities such as LFI, blind SQL injection, HTTP header related vulnerabilities, do not explicitly require authentication, and can often be exploited by an attacker with network connectivity to the target device.
*   An attacker would need network access to the printer, often on the same LAN segment, or access to the device via the internet if it is accessible from the internet.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin credits security researcher Imran Siddiqui for reporting the vulnerabilities.
*   The bulletin highlights the affected Xerox WorkCentre and Phaser models and provides software update links.
* The document indicates that multiple vulnerabilities have been addressed, not just one single CVE.

**Conclusion:**

This document is relevant to CVE-2018-20771 as it provides a detailed list of security vulnerabilities addressed in a security bulletin released by Xerox. It is likely that CVE-2018-20771 is one of the identified vulnerabilities addressed here.
