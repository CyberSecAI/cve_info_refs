Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect role checks during user creation in TheHive-Project's Cortex. Specifically, the system failed to properly verify if a user creating another user had the authority to assign certain roles, particularly the "superAdmin" role.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is a lack of proper access control during user creation. The system did not enforce restrictions based on the creator's role, allowing users with lower privileges (organization admin) to create users with higher privileges (super admin).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, by compromising an organization admin account, could create a new super admin user, effectively gaining full control of the Cortex instance.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The newly created super admin account could be used to access and manipulate sensitive data, configurations, and other resources within Cortex.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The attack vector involves exploiting the user creation functionality by utilizing an existing organization admin account.
*   **User Management API:** The vulnerability is likely present within the API endpoint responsible for creating users, specifically in the code that verifies the role of the user being created.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Organization Admin Account:** The attacker needs to have access to a valid organization admin user account within the Cortex system. This could be obtained through credential theft or other means.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Cortex instance, typically over a network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a GitHub issue and commit related to this vulnerability. Specifically, issue #158 and commit `1aaf2182a6b722ad539e2717bc11967d1bde723a` show the bug report and the fix implementation.
*   The fix involved a change in the `UserCtrl.scala` file, which updated the role verification logic to prevent an organization admin from creating a super admin account.
*   The vulnerability affects Cortex version 2.1.2 and was fixed in version 2.1.3.
