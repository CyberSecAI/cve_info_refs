  "CVE-2018-20615": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read issue was discovered in the HTTP/2 protocol decoder in HAProxy 1.8.x and 1.9.x through 1.9.0 which can result in a crash. The processing of the PRIORITY flag in a HEADERS frame requires 5 extra bytes, and while these bytes are skipped, the total frame length was not re-checked to make sure they were present in the frame.",
    "affected_components": [
      "HAProxy"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The HTTP/2 decoder in HAProxy does not properly validate the frame length of HEADERS frames when the PRIORITY flag is set, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted HTTP/2 request that triggers the out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the HAProxy service.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects HAProxy versions 1.8.x and 1.9.x through 1.9.0. The issue is related to the handling of the PRIORITY flag in a HEADERS frame in the HTTP/2 protocol decoder.  Specifically, the decoder skips 5 bytes when processing the priority flag, but does not recheck if the frame length has enough remaining bytes for that skip, which leads to the out-of-bounds read. This issue is considered critical for systems that have HTTP/2 enabled.",
     "patches": [
        "HAProxy 1.8.17",
        "HAProxy 1.9.1"

        "1.8.x",
