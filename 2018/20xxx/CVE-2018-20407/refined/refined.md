- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted input file processed by the `mp42hls` tool leads to memory leaks in `Ap4DescriptorFactory.cpp` and other related files within Bento4 version 1.5.1-627. The issue arises from the way the software handles specific descriptor structures during parsing of MP4 files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leaks occur during the creation of descriptors, specifically when parsing a crafted MP4 file. This suggests improper memory management during the object creation process within `AP4_DescriptorFactory::CreateDescriptorFromStream` and related functions. The specific leaks include:
    - Direct leaks from `operator new` calls.
    - Indirect leaks from memory allocated in `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer` and `AP4_List::Add`.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is memory exhaustion. Repeated processing of crafted MP4 files could lead to a denial-of-service due to excessive memory consumption and potential crashes.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file as input to the `mp42hls` tool.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted MP4 file to the `mp42hls` tool. This can be achieved either by user interaction or some other means of triggering the tool.
