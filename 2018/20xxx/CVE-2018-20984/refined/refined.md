The provided content is a detailed changelog and description of the "Patreon WordPress" plugin, which integrates Patreon features into WordPress websites. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2018-20984, it contains information about various security fixes and improvements made to the plugin over time. Here's a breakdown of relevant security information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed (Based on Changelog):**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability (1.8.8):**
    *   **Weakness:** A minor CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability was fixed.
    *   **Impact:** This could allow an attacker to perform unwanted actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as changing settings related to Patreon integration.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation would require tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or performing an action on a crafted page.
*   **XSS Vulnerability (1.8.2):**
    *   **Weakness:** Sanitization was added for arbitrary text and number input fields in options forms to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, potentially compromising the website.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious code into the plugin's settings, which would then execute in a victim's browser when they viewed those settings.
*   **Image Lock Circumvention (1.9.1):**
    *   **Weakness:** An issue that allowed bypassing image locking by sending a specific referrer header was fixed.
    *   **Impact:** Previously, an attacker could potentially gain access to locked images without proper authorization.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation would involve sending a specific referer header when requesting a locked image.
*  **Object Injection Vulnerability (1.2.2):**
   *  **Weakness:** A potential object injection vulnerability was fixed
   *  **Impact:** Could lead to vulnerable 3rd party plugins getting compromised.
   *  **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of the vulnerability is not specified, but this would likely involve a crafted payload being passed to the plugin that would then be interpreted as an object

**Other Security Improvements:**

*   **Security Nonces Added (1.8.7):** Security nonces were added to various actions and forms to prevent CSRF attacks.
*   **Nonce Checks (Various Versions):** Nonce checks were added to various actions such as disconnect Patreon user account, toggle options, reconnect site, disconnect site, synced post category saving, synced post author saving for better protection against CSRF.
*   **Input Sanitization (1.7.2, 1.8.0, 1.8.2):** Input sanitization was added to various fields to prevent XSS and other injection vulnerabilities. This includes sanitization for custom page names, text and number input fields.
*  **Image/file lock feature check (1.7.0):** Added a check to see if an image exists in media library before serving an image with image lock feature and added a check to image/file locking feature to see if image/file locking is enabled before allowing use of image/file locking function.
*   **API Call Throttling (1.8.4):** Call throttling was added to API calls to avoid spamming of the API by faulty sites and limit the rate of requests.
*  **No Cache Headers (1.4.0, 1.3.9):** Added no-cache headers to prevent caching of gated content, ensuring users see the correct unlocked content after becoming patrons.
* **Rate limiting (1.8.4, 1.5.5):** Various mechanisms were implemented to limit requests, for example caching of user data or throttling of API calls
* **Improved Error Handling (1.7.2, 1.6.5, 1.3.1, 1.2.3):** Improvements to error handling have been added to log errors more accurately and to provide user-friendly error messages.

**General Security Practices:**

*   **Following WordPress Coding Standards:** The plugin aims to adhere to WordPress coding standards, which should contribute to better security.
