Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20453.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `getlong` function of `numutils.c` at line 22.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read operation occurs out of bounds of the allocated heap memory in the `getlong` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination due to a corrupted heap state.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be carefully crafted.
- The program crashes with a `SIGABRT` signal due to a corrupted size vs. prev_size error.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted input file can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow when processed by the `doc2txt` tool. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when processing a file, presumably an OLE file (judging from the callstack), that contains specific crafted data that causes `getlong` to read out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a malicious input file to the `doc2txt` tool which is run by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs no elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
