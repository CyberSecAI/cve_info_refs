### Accelerating Startup Innovation Through Simulation, HPC, and AI

The top three concerns that often plague startups are cost constraints, lack of resource expertise, and enabling technology such as scalable HPC resources or simulation tools. And if you've founded a startup that invents, develops, and builds new physical products, that results in even more things to consider. While many large corporations claim to support startups so they can grow and succeed, there's still an inherent technology gap – especially for companies designing, developing, and manufacturing physical products.

But these complexities don't have to keep you up at night. Smarter, simpler, and scalable simulation, HPC, and AI solutions can unlock your potential and transform your startup. Join panelists from Altair, Oracle for Startups, and Urwahn Bikes, as we share practical hands-on experience that will help you overcome your technology, business, and product development challenges.
