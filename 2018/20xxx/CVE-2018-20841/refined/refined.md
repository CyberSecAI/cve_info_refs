Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in HooToo TripMate routers, which are relevant to CVE-2018-20841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure coding practices** within the `ioos` binary, a custom CGI server, lead to multiple vulnerabilities. The `ioos` binary does not implement proper input sanitization and authentication checks before processing user-supplied data in various functions.
*   Lack of input validation leads to **buffer overflows**.
*   Lack of sanitization leads to **OS command injection** vulnerabilities.
*   Lack of access control and validation leads to **arbitrary file upload** and **unauthenticated firmware update** vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) in `/sysfirm.csp`:** An attacker can upload a malicious shell script disguised as a firmware update, which is then executed by the router.
*   **Multiple Unauthenticated OS Command Injections:** Vulnerabilities in `open_forwarding` (ip parameter) and `mac_table` (mac parameter) allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The router allows an attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations through the `protocol.csp` endpoint using a crafted POST request with a manipulated filename parameter in multipart/form-data. This allows for overwriting sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`.
*   **Unauthenticated Buffer Overflows:** Stack-based buffer overflows were found in `pwdchk`, `mac_table`, and `open_forwarding`.
*   **Unauthenticated Off-by-one Buffer Overflow in URI:** This can cause a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete compromise of the device:** Attackers can achieve remote code execution, gaining full control of the router.
*   **Data exfiltration:** Once in control of the device, attackers can eavesdrop on network traffic and potentially steal sensitive information.
*   **Network disruption:** Attackers can disrupt network services and carry out further attacks.
*   **Malware deployment:** The attacker could use the device as a botnet node or to perform other malicious activities.
*   **Arbitrary file modification:** Overwriting `/etc/shadow` can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain admin access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP requests:** Exploiting vulnerabilities through crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to the router's web interface (`/protocol.csp` and `/sysfirm.csp` endpoints).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router, typically through a Wi-Fi connection or via a network where the router is connected.
*   **No Authentication Required:** All the mentioned vulnerabilities are unauthenticated, meaning the attacker does not need any prior access or credentials to exploit them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post details the process of reverse engineering the `ioos` binary to find the vulnerabilities.
*   The Metasploit module on Exploit-DB exploits the command injection vulnerability in `mac_table` to open a telnet backdoor.
*   The IOActive advisory lists multiple HooToo TripMate models that share the same vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerabilities detailed in the ioactive.com content are more comprehensive than the exploit-db content
