## v10.6.2 - 3 May 2020

### Fixes

* Last.fm scrobbling should be working again (#1655)
* Incomplete support for some platforms in the internal diagnostics page (#1641, #1664)

## v10.6.1 - 19 Apr 2020

### Fixes

* Fix issue with DLNA not working (#1634)
* Fix issue with scanning error on some media types (e.g. WAV) (#1626)

## v10.6.0 - 15 Apr 2020

### New features

* Support for sending scrobbling information to the "ListenBrainz" service has
  been added (#1224)
* A new "More" link has been added to the "About" page, containing detailed
  system diagnostic information. This page will help us diagnose issues more
  easily in the future. (#1457)
* The default 'admin' user can now be deleted if another admin user is present
  on the system, which can improve security by avoiding having a hardcoded
  username always available. Features that require an admin user (namely,
  automated playlist import) will use the first admin user in the database. (#1131)
* The play queue can now be toggled on/off with a button, which helps use
  Airsonic on touch devices (tablets, ultrabooks). (#1539)
* An 'add to play queue' action has been added to playlist pages. (#1433)

### Fixes and updates

* External database drivers have been updated to more recent versions. In
  particular, the MySQL driver now supports MySQL 8.0, and initial migrations
  on PostgreSQL should work properly again. (#1452 and #1511)
* The seek support for transcoding has now been re-enabled again, now that
  we're more confident that this works fine with the HTML5 player. (#1123)
* Accuracy of the "search" feature has been improved, with search now ranking
  by artist (resp. album or song) name in the artists (resp. albums or songs)
  category. (#1235)
* The systemd example file has been updated with a couple of changes related to
  device/driver access. (#1406)
* DLNA support should now be exposed properly through Docker, which wasn't the
  case before. (#1380)
* The tabs on the main page no longer auto-refresh at regular intervals.
  Instead a "refresh" link is available to trigger a reload manually. (#1338 #1339 #1413)

### Others

* The dark theme has seen some tweaks.
* Fix harmless error message about missing "web.xml"
* Fix not to perform clean up during scan
* Change to new shuffle generator

* Avoid exceptions if Lucene index is not ready on first startup

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your GitHub account as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.
