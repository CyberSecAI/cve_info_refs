Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-20536:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `liblas::SpatialReference::GetGTIF()` function at `src/spatialreference.cpp:518`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow. The `__asan_memcpy` function is called with an invalid size, resulting in a read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The program crashes due to the heap-buffer-overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted LAS file. The vulnerability is triggered when the `liblas::SpatialReference::GetGTIF()` function is called while parsing a LAS file, specifically during the reading of Variable Length Records (VLRs).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted LAS file to the vulnerable application (e.g., `las2pg`).
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability other than being able to run the affected application with the malicious input file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function is called during the creation of a `liblas::SpatialReference` object, specifically from a vector of `liblas::VariableRecord` objects which were read from the file.
- The AddressSanitizer output shows a read of 262208 bytes at address 0x60600000e400, which is outside of the allocated 64-byte region. This occurs within the `ST_SetKey` function of the `libgeotiff` library, which is called by `liblas::SpatialReference::GetGTIF()`.
- The bug was found in Fedora 31 during its development cycle.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `liblas-1.8.1-5.fc32` for Fedora 32 and `liblas-1.8.1-5.fc31` for Fedora 31.
