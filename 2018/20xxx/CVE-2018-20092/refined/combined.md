## Trust, transparency, and PTC

---

Stemming from PTC’s commitment to sharing the information our customers and partners need to be confident in doing business with us, our Trust Center exists as a hub for information on our compliance with all laws and regulations that apply to our business as well as a resource to learn more about how we protect data entrusted to us. Whether you’re a longstanding customer or brand new to PTC, we aim to balance transparency with the security of our operations and strive to disclose any information your organization needs for due diligence activities. Let's work together to create a safer, more secure, and resilient digital environment for everyone.

## Responsible AI at PTC

We pride ourselves on leveraging technological innovations to help us work smarter and give our customers more Power To Create, but we also recognize that there is a careful balance to be maintained between the risks and benefits of adopting new technology.

With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), finding this balance has never been more critical.

PTC’s AI Governance Council, AI@PTC, was formed to assess the risks and benefits that AI presents to PTC and to create processes that enable the responsible use of AI@PTC.

AI@PTC has identified transparency as a core principle to guide PTC’s responsible use of AI. This means that PTC knows:

* How AI is used in our business operations and development processes
* What data is made available to AI and how is it processed
* Where AI is used in our products, for which we will follow the 4 NIST Principles of Explainable AI

Equipped with this information, PTC can ensure that all supporting business processes account for the impact of AI, including Vendor Risk Management, IT Security, Data Privacy, Secure Software Development, and Compliance. PTC will continuously adapt its operations to the AI technology and regulatory landscape as it evolves to maintain this commitment to Responsible AI.
