## Description

When unpacking a tarball with the unpack\_in-family of functions it's intended that only files within the specified directory are able to be written. Tarballs with hard links or symlinks, however, can be used to overwrite any file on the filesystem. Tarballs can contain multiple entries for the same file. A tarball which first contains an entry for a hard link or symlink pointing to any file on the filesystem will have the link created, and then afterwards if the same file is listed in the tarball the hard link will be rewritten and any file can be rewritten on the filesystem.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

When unpacking a tarball with the `unpack_in`-family of functions it's intended
that only files within the specified directory are able to be written. Tarballs
with hard links or symlinks, however, can be used to overwrite any file on the
filesystem.

Tarballs can contain multiple entries for the same file. A tarball which first
contains an entry for a hard link or symlink pointing to any file on the
filesystem will have the link created, and then afterwards if the same file is
listed in the tarball the hard link will be rewritten and any file can be
rewritten on the filesystem.

This has been fixed in https://github.com/alexcrichton/tar-rs/pull/156 and is
published as `tar` 0.4.16. Thanks to Max Justicz for discovering this and
emailing about the issue!

Copy link

Owner

### @alexcrichton **[alexcrichton](/alexcrichton)** commented [Jun 29, 2018](#issue-337069804)

This crate tries to provide the guarantee that `unpack_in` won't actually overwrite any files outside of the provided directory. Unfortunately though there's a hole in this logic where a hard link can be used to overwrite an arbitrary file on the filesystem.

This commit fixes this issue by using the preexisting logic for extracting paths outside the destination (including symlinks) to validate the link destination of a hard link.

Sorry, something went wrong.
