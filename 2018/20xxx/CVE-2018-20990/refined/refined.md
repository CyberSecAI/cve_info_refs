Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-20990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `tar-rs` crate handles hard links and symlinks when unpacking tar archives using the `unpack_in` family of functions. Specifically, it fails to properly validate the target of hard links and symlinks, which allows for writing outside of the intended destination directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The core vulnerability is the ability to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system.
- **Unvalidated Hard Links/Symlinks:** The `tar-rs` crate doesn't validate the target of hard links and symlinks during unpacking, which allows attackers to point these links to any location.
- **Multiple Entries for the Same File:** The tar format allows multiple entries for the same file name within a tar archive. This can be exploited to first create a hard/symlink to an arbitrary file, and then overwrite it with the contents of a later entry with the same name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption/Loss:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the filesystem which can cause data corruption or loss.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting crucial files, an attacker might be able to gain code execution or escalate privileges.
- **System Compromise:** The overall impact can be complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Tar Archive:** A specially crafted tar archive containing malicious hard links/symlinks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Tar Archive:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious tar archive to the vulnerable application or system.
- **No Specific Privileges Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any special privileges required by the user running the application using the tar crate.
- **No User Interaction Required:** No user interaction is required besides providing the malicious archive.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability occurs when the `unpack_in` family of functions in the `tar-rs` crate processes tar archives with hard or soft links. These functions are intended to only write files within a specific destination directory. However, by placing a hard link or symlink to a file outside the directory, the tar library will create this link, and then if a file entry exists with the same name, the library will overwrite whatever the link pointed to. This bypasses the intended safety restrictions and allows for writing to arbitrary files.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was addressed by validating the link destinations for both hard and symlinks before creating them, preventing them from pointing to locations outside the intended destination directory. The fix was released in version 0.4.16 of the `tar-rs` crate.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** None
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Scope:** Unchanged
- **Confidentiality:** None
- **Integrity:** High
- **Availability:** None

**Additional Notes:**
