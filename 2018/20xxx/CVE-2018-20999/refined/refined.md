Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the streaming state within the `orion` crate in versions prior to 0.11.2. The `reset()` function in affected versions incorrectly checked if the state was already finalized before resetting. If `reset()` was called before finalizing the stream, the state was not reset, leading to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect State Management:** The core issue is a flaw in how the streaming state was managed during the reset operation. The `reset()` function should have reset the state regardless of whether the stream was finalized or not.
- **Logical Error:** The logic behind the `reset()` function was flawed, as it incorrectly assumed that the stream state would always be finalized before a reset was needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Results:** Exploitation of this vulnerability would lead to the generation of incorrect results from cryptographic functions such as `hmac`, `poly1305`, `blake2b`, and `cshake`.
- **Potential Security Implications:** Depending on how these cryptographic functions are used, this could lead to a variety of security issues, such as data corruption, authentication bypass, or other unexpected behavior, however, the CVSS score indicates that only availability is impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Library Usage:** An attacker would exploit this flaw by using the vulnerable versions of the `orion` crate and calling the `reset()` function on a streaming state without finalizing it first, leading to the generation of invalid cryptographic data.
- **Network:** The CVSS score indicates that the attack vector is through the network. This implies that the vulnerable library is used in a context where its operation is reachable through a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Use of Vulnerable Library:** The attacker must be using a vulnerable version of the `orion` library.
- **Control over Function Calls:** The attacker must be able to control the execution flow and call the `reset()` function on streaming states without finalizing them first.
- **No Privileges Needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any special privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as a High severity issue.
*   The fix for this issue was to modify the `reset()` function to not check if the state had already been reset.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple cryptographic streaming states in the orion crate
*   The affected versions are < 0.11.2. Version 0.11.2 and later are patched.
