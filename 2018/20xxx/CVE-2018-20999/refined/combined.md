## Affected versions

< 0.11.2

## Patched versions

0.11.2

## Description

Affected versions of this crate did not properly reset a streaming state. Resetting a streaming state, without finalising it first, creates incorrect results. The flaw was corrected by not first checking if the state had already been reset, when calling reset().

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@brycx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34031846?u=e5b300d1cebed485b3dbd38bfcff6187be71c00e&v=4&size=48)](/brycx)[brycx](https://github.com/brycx)opened [on Dec 20, 2018](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/issues/46#issue-393132155)

Currently `reset()` checks whether or not the state is already finalized. If it is not finalized, it will not reset the state. So if someone were to call `reset()` not having finalized the state before, incorrect results would be produced. Such streaming states include `hmac`, `poly1305`, `blake2b` and `cshake`.
