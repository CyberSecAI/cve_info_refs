- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses user-controlled input to construct a file path without proper sanitization, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability. Specifically, the `keys` parameter from the request is used to construct a file path without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary properties files on the server by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a `keys` parameter containing `../` sequences to the affected endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint and control the `keys` parameter.
