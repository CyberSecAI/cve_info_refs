- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to correctly interpret the `X-Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` header, leading to the execution of malicious code embedded in SVG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the browser's incorrect handling of the Content Security Policy.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view a wiki page with a crafted SVG.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file as an attachment to a wiki page. The victim then opens the SVG file in Internet Explorer, triggering the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit wiki pages within a GitLab installation, and the victim must use Internet Explorer to view the malicious SVG.
