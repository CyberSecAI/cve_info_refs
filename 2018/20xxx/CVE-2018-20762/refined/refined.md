Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability present in the `cat_multiple_files` function within `applications/mp4box/fileimport.c`. This function processes file names, parsing different parts of the name into separate buffers for further processing. The vulnerability occurs because the code uses `strcpy` without proper length checks when copying data into the `cat_enum.szOpt` buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow in the `strcpy(cat_enum.szOpt, sep);` line. If the length of the string pointed to by `sep` exceeds the size of `cat_enum.szOpt`, a buffer overflow occurs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of the length of the input string before copying it into a fixed-size buffer using `strcpy`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the `MP4Box` utility, causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In a more severe scenario, a carefully crafted input could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted input file that contains an overly long string in the filename. The filename will be parsed by `cat_multiple_files`.
*   **Command-Line Argument:** The specific example provided in the issue report shows the attack is triggered via the command-line argument to `MP4Box` with the `-cat` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `MP4Box` utility. This could involve:
    *   Convincing a user to process a malicious file name.
    *   Using an automated process that processes untrusted input.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a file name that, when parsed, creates an overly long string that will overflow the `szOpt` buffer when `strcpy` is called.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided commit diffs show that similar `strcpy` buffer overflows were fixed in other files as well, such as `applications/mp4client/main.c`, `modules/ffmpeg_in/ffmpeg_demux.c`, and `src/scene_manager/scene_manager.c`. These fixes replace `strcpy` with `strncpy` and add checks on input string length.
*   The issue report #1187 provides a specific example of the overflow being triggered in `cat_multiple_files`, with a long string in the filename passed with the `-cat` argument.
*   The Debian and Ubuntu security notices confirm that this CVE, along with several others, were addressed in updated versions of the `gpac` package. The notices also mention that exploitation could lead to DoS or arbitrary code execution, and that the vulnerability is a buffer overflow.
