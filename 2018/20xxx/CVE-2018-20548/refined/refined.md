{
  "CVE-2018-20548": {
    "description": "There is an illegal WRITE memory access at common-image.c (function load\_image) in libcaca 0.99.beta19 for 1bpp data.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An illegal write memory access in the `load_image` function at `common-image.c` when handling 1bpp image data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper memory handling leading to an out-of-bounds write."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution is a potential impact. However, SUSE rates the availability impact as low, with confidentiality and integrity being none.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Network",
          "Local"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. However, the SUSE rating indicates that no user interaction is required, so an attacker could perform a local attack.",
          "Notes": "SUSE has rated this as a low severity vulnerability that can be exploited by local users. The NVD rating of 8.8 is very high (High) for a vulnerability that requires a user to take action.  The SUSE rating more accurately represents the issue which is a local attack (AV:L) that has a low impact (A:L, C:N, I:N). The NVD rating of AV:N is incorrect since the attack has to be local."
