- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of user-supplied input in Markdown fields, specifically label references.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize or encode HTML entities within label references, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into project pages. This code can be used to compromise user accounts by stealing credentials, changing user settings, or performing other actions on behalf of the victim. The report mentions the possibility of changing SSH keys or passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: By editing a Markdown field (e.g. in a README.md file), a malicious user can insert a crafted label reference containing HTML entities that decode into executable JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to edit Markdown content within a GitLab project. This could be an authenticated user or a user with commit access to a repository.
