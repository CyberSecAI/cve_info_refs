# Stored XSS in Markdown fields via Label references

**[HackerOne report #449191](https://hackerone.com/reports/449191)** by jouko on 2018-11-23:

**Summary:**
A specially formatted Label reference in Markdown fields can be used to inject JavaScript on GitLab pages.

**Description:**
A tilde symbol followed by a double-quoted label name creates a link to the named label, i.e. `~"label name"`. A malicious user can enter arbitrary entity-encoded HTML in the quotes. The entities are decoded on the resulting page allowing dangerous HTML to be embedded.

Example:

```
~"&lt;img src=x onerror=&quot;alert('hello')&quot;&gt;"
```

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Edit e.g. a README.md file of a project
2. Enter `~"&lt;img src=x onerror=&quot;alert('hello')&quot;&gt;"`
3. Click Preview or just save the modification
4. Observe a JavaScript alert box when the page is viewed

## Impact

An attacker could inject JavaScript in projects to compromise accounts of people who view them. See #448691 for an example of how an attacker could change the victims' SSH keys or set their passwords.
