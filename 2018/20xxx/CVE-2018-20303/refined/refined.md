Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-20303:

**Summary:**

The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Gogs, a self-hosted Git service, that allows for remote code execution (RCE) through a combination of authentication bypass and git hook manipulation. The vulnerability is related to a flaw in path sanitization. This vulnerability was addressed in commit `ff93d9dbda5cebe90d86e4b7dfb2c6b8642970ce` and mentioned in issue #5558.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient sanitization of user-provided file paths. Specifically, the `SanitizePath` function in `pkg/tool/path.go` was not properly handling directory traversal sequences like `../` which could allow an attacker to bypass intended file access restrictions. The initial implementation used `strings.TrimLeft` which is insufficient as it does not remove the sequence if it appears later in the string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal. The `SanitizePath` function failed to fully remove directory traversal sequences (`../`).
2.  **Authentication Bypass:**  An attacker could use the path traversal vulnerability to manipulate session files, allowing them to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges.
3.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Once authenticated as an administrator, an attacker could use git hooks to execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious file that is later executed via a hook.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could gain full control of the affected system.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored on the Git server could be compromised.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker may cause a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Directory Traversal:** The attacker uses directory traversal sequences within file paths to access or manipulate sensitive files.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating session files with directory traversal, an attacker can gain administrator access.
3.  **Git Hook Injection:**  After gaining admin access, the attacker uses git hooks to execute code on the server by uploading a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Gogs server.
*   **Understanding of Git and Gogs:** A good understanding of how Gogs works and how to manipulate git hooks is necessary.
*   **Ability to craft specific paths:** The attacker needs to be able to craft file paths that exploit the path traversal vulnerability.
* **No prior authentication needed:** The attacker can gain admin access without authenticating first by exploiting path traversal in session files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The patch for the vulnerability, as seen in commit `ff93d9dbda5cebe90d86e4b7dfb2c6b8642970ce`, improved the `SanitizePath` function to remove the "../" sequence.
*   The issue was reported on December 18, 2018, by a user named snyff.
