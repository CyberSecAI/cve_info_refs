# Gogs RCE

*Bookmarked!*

This exercise covers how to get code execution against the Git self hosted tool: Gogs.

In this course, you will learn to exploit a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability in Gogs, a self-hosted git service. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges by exploiting a session management flaw. Once authenticated as an administrator, the attacker can utilize git hooks to execute arbitrary commands on the server, demonstrating how vulnerabilities can be chained for greater impact.

The course is divided into two main parts: the first part focuses on bypassing authentication by manipulating session files through directory traversal. The second part demonstrates how to upload a malicious file to achieve code execution via git hooks. This exercise emphasizes the importance of understanding and combining different vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and achieve full system compromise.

## Description

[![@snyff](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45491?v=4&size=48)](/snyff)[snyff](https://github.com/snyff)opened [on Dec 18, 2018](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/5558#issue-391962786)

Gogs version (or commit ref): latest (0.11.79)

Can you reproduce the bug at <https://try.gogs.io>:

[ ] Yes (provide example URL)

[X] No it's currently down

I discovered a way to gain code execution (via a bypass of the authentication to gain admin access, very similar to [#5469](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/5469)) or to trigger a small denial of service.

Can you confirm u@gogs.io is still the best email to send more details?

Best,

Louis
