Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how libopenmpt handles malformed MED files. Specifically, it leads to a crash due to an out-of-bounds read during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer while parsing a malformed MED file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a crash of the application using the libopenmpt library. This leads to a denial of service, as the application becomes unusable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The attack vector is a malformed MED file. An attacker could craft such a file and then deliver it to a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Access/User Interaction:** An attacker needs to provide the malformed MED file to an application using the vulnerable libopenmpt library. This likely requires some level of user interaction, such as a user opening the file.
