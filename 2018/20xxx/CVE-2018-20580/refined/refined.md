  "CVE-2018-20580": {
    "description": "The ReadyAPI software allows users to open SOAP projects and import WSDL files that help communicate with remote servers. An attacker can inject malicious code into a default value of one of the parameters within a WSDL file and spread it to ReadyAPI clients. When a ReadyAPI client loads this malicious WSDL file and sends a request, the software executes the malicious code on the victim's computer.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability of a malicious WSDL file to inject and execute code when parsed by ReadyAPI.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation.",
         "Lack of sanitization of WSDL file parameters.",
         "Unrestricted execution of code within the application context."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the victim's machine. This allows an attacker to potentially take complete control of the affected computer.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious WSDL file is created and hosted on a server controlled by an attacker.  The file can also be distributed by other means. When a ReadyAPI user imports this WSDL, the vulnerability is triggered."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute the crafted WSDL file and entice users to import and execute the malicious request."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "ReadyAPI 2.5.0",
      "ReadyAPI 2.6.0"
