Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-20743:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `murmur` server in Mumble mishandles multiple concurrent requests that are persisted in the database. This is due to the lack of proper rate limiting mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of sufficient rate limiting for incoming requests. This allows a malicious actor to overwhelm the server with a flood of messages.
- **Database Persistence:** The vulnerability is triggered by the fact that the requests are persisted in the database, potentially leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by flooding the server with messages, which may lead to:
    - Daemon hang
    - Daemon crash
    - Server freeze and/or crash
    - Server unavailability

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Message Flooding:** The attack vector involves sending a flood of specially crafted messages to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Mumble server.
- **No Special Permissions:** The attack does not require any special privileges or authentication. The attacker can be a regular client, a bot or an unauthenticated user.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Mumble servers up to version 1.2.19 before 2018-08-31.
- The fix involves implementing a rate limiter using the Leaky Bucket algorithm. This allows a burst of messages but limits them after a certain threshold within a time frame.
- The initial patch applied a rate limit of 30 burst messages and a subsequent limit of 4 messages per second which was later lowered to 5 burst messages and 1 message per second.
- Patches to address this vulnerability were backported to older versions of Mumble.
- The issue was assigned a priority of P0 - Blocker, indicating the urgency of the fix.
