    "CVE": "CVE-2018-20005",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "heap-use-after-free",
        "description": "A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `mxmlWalkNext` function in `mxml-search.c` of the Mini-XML library.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered when `mxmlWalkNext` attempts to access a heap memory region that has been freed earlier by `sort_node`. Specifically, `sort_node` frees a node, but `mxmlWalkNext` continues to access it.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use-after-free"
        ],
        "impact": "The impact is a crash due to memory corruption leading to a denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Crafted XML input",
            "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted XML file using the `mxmldoc` utility. Specifically, the crafted input leads to a call to `sort_node` which frees memory which is then accessed by `mxmlWalkNext`."
        ],
           "required_capabilities": [
              "An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted XML file to be processed by the `mxmldoc` utility."
