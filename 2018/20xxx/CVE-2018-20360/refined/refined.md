Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `ifilter_bank` function in `libfaad/filtbank.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. When a crafted MPEG AAC file triggers the NULL pointer dereference, the affected application (faad2) will crash.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution**:  While the provided information primarily points to DoS, some sources mention a potential for arbitrary code execution if malformed media files are processed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MPEG AAC Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted MPEG AAC media files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malformed Input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed MPEG AAC file to the vulnerable application (faad2). This could be achieved in various ways, such as providing a malicious file to a user or through an attack vector that involves processing media data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm that CVE-2018-20360 relates to a NULL pointer dereference in `ifilter_bank` function of `libfaad/filtbank.c`.
*   The vulnerability is present in faad2 versions prior to the fixes provided in the security updates.
*   The Debian Security Advisories (DSA and DLA) mention that this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   The Gentoo security advisory also identifies this CVE as one of several vulnerabilities in FAAD2 that could result in arbitrary code execution.
*   The github issue describes a crash in a different function (sbr_process_channel), but does not relate to the identified vulnerability.

The provided information confirms that CVE-2018-20360 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the `ifilter_bank` function in `libfaad/filtbank.c` of the `faad2` library, which can be exploited using crafted MPEG AAC files to cause denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
