{
  "Root cause": "Missing authentication on sensitive HTTP endpoints",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Lack of authentication on sensitive endpoints such as /configuration.xml"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of sensitive information, including video stream access details (IP, port, encryption info), potentially leading to unauthorized access to the video stream.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints (e.g., /configuration.xml).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the device."
