| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1119687#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2018-12-17 09:42:36 UTC  ``` <https://blade.tencent.com/magellan/index_en.html>  A remote code execution vulnerability was reported to exist in SQLite by Tencent Blade Team. Labeled Magellan.   The effects are said to be RCE, including leakage of program privileged information or DoS. Reportedly, the vector includes interfaces that accept arbitrary SQLite3 queries, in particular WebSQL style. Bug is that arbitrary queries can write to shadow tables. Integer overflow fixed in <https://sqlite.org/src/info/940f2adc8541a838> (3.25.3) "Add extra defenses against strategically corrupt databases to fts3/4.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131576#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-04-04 14:48:19 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-20506  SQLite before 3.25.3, when the FTS3 extension is enabled, encounters an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use cases). This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-20346.

# CVE-2018-20506

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-20505.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-20509.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-20506 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20506)

#### Description

SQLite before 3.25.3, when the FTS3 extension is enabled, encounters an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use cases). This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-20346.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.Â  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

                 CVE-2020-13871
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sqlite3, a C library that
implements an SQL database engine.

CVE-2018-8740

    Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS statement
    could cause a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2018-20346

    When the FTS3 extension is enabled, sqlite3 encounters an integer
    overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries that occur
    after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables, allowing remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the ability to run
    arbitrary SQL statements.

CVE-2018-20506

    When the FTS3 extension is enabled, sqlite3 encounters an integer
    overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for FTS3 queries in a
    "merge" operation that occurs after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow
    tables, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
    leveraging the ability to run arbitrary SQL statements

CVE-2019-5827

    Integer overflow allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit
    heap corruption via a crafted HTML page, primarily impacting
    chromium.

CVE-2019-9936

    Running fts5 prefix queries inside a transaction could trigger a
    heap-based buffer over-read, which may lead to an information leak.

CVE-2019-9937

    Interleaving reads and writes in a single transaction with an fts5
    virtual table will lead to a NULL Pointer Dereference.

CVE-2019-16168

    A browser or other application can be triggered to crash because of
    inadequate parameter validation which could lead to a divide-by-zero
    error.

CVE-2019-20218

    WITH stack unwinding proceeds even after a parsing error, resulting
    in a possible application crash.

CVE-2020-13630

    The code related to the snippet feature exhibits a use-after-free
    defect.

CVE-2020-13632

    A crafted matchinfo() query can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-13871

    The parse tree rewrite for window functions is too late, leading to
    a use-after-free defect.

CVE-2020-11655

    An improper initialization of AggInfo objects allows attackers to
    cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a malformed
    window-function query.

CVE-2020-13434

    The code in sqlite3_str_vappendf in printf.c contains an integer
    overflow defect.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.2-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlite3 packages.

For the detailed security status of sqlite3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sqlite3>
