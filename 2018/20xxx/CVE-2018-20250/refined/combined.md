##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

        In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61, there is path traversal vulnerability
        when crafting the filename field of the ACE format (in UNACEV2.dll). When the filename
        field is manipulated with specific patterns, the destination (extraction) folder is
        ignored, thus treating the filename as an absolute path. This module will attempt to
        extract a payload to the startup folder of the current user. It is limited such that
        we can only go back one folder. Therefore, for this exploit to work properly, the user
        must extract the supplied RAR file from one folder within the user profile folder
        (e.g. Desktop or Downloads). User restart is required to gain a shell.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

when crafting the filename field of the ACE format (in UNACEV2.dll). When the filename
field is manipulated with specific patterns, the destination (extraction) folder is
ignored, thus treating the filename as an absolute path. This module will attempt to
extract a payload to the startup folder of the current user. It is limited such that
we can only go back one folder. Therefore, for this exploit to work properly, the user
must extract the supplied RAR file from one folder within the user profile folder
(e.g. Desktop or Downloads). User restart is required to gain a shell.

# Extracting a 19 Year Old Code Execution from WinRAR

February 20, 2019

https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/

**Research by:** Nadav Grossman

#### **Introduction**

In this article, we tell the story of how we found a logical bug using the [WinAFL fuzzer](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl) and exploited it in [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) to gain full control over a victim’s computer. The exploit works by just extracting an archive, and puts over [500 million users](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) at risk. This vulnerability has existed for over 19 years(!) and forced WinRAR to completely drop support for the vulnerable format.

#### **Background**

A few months ago, our team built a multi-processor fuzzing lab and started to fuzz binaries for Windows environments using the WinAFL fuzzer. After the good results we got from our [Adobe Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/50-adobe-cves-in-50-days/), we decided to expand our fuzzing efforts and started to fuzz WinRAR too.

One of the crashes produced by the fuzzer led us to an old, dated dynamic link library (dll) that was compiled back in 2006 without a protection mechanism (like ASLR, DEP, etc.) and is used by WinRAR.

We turned our focus and fuzzer to this “low hanging fruit” dll, and looked for a memory corruption bug that would hopefully lead to Remote Code Execution.

However, the fuzzer produced a test case with “weird” behavior. After researching this behavior, we found a logical bug: Absolute Path Traversal. From this point on it was simple to leverage this vulnerability to a remote code execution.

Perhaps it’s also worth mentioning that a substantial amount of money in various bug bounty programs is offered for these types of vulnerabilities.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig1.png)**Figure 1:** Zerodium tweet on purchasing WinRAR vulnerability.](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig1.png)

##### **What is WinRAR?**

WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows which can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats and unpack numerous archive file formats.

According to the [WinRAR website](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0), over 500 million users worldwide make WinRAR the world’s most popular compression tool today.

This is what the GUI looks like:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig2.png)

**Figure 2**: WinRAR GUI.

##### **The Fuzzing Process Background**

These are the steps taken to start fuzzing WinRAR:

1. Creation of an internal harness inside the WinRAR main function which enables us to fuzz any archive type, without stitching a specific harness for each format. This is done by patching the WinRAR executable.
2. Eliminate GUI elements such as message boxes and dialogs which require user interaction. This is also done by patching the WinRAR executable.

   There are some message boxes that pop up even in CLI mode of WinRAR.
3. Use a giant corpus from an interesting piece of research conducted around 2005 by the University of [Oulu](https://www.ee.oulu.fi/roles/ouspg/PROTOS_Test-Suite_c10-archive).
4. Fuzz the program with WinAFL using WinRAR command line switches. These force WinRAR to parse the “broken archive” and also set default passwords (“-p” for password and “-kb” for keep broken extracted files). We found those options in a WinRAR manual/help file.

After a short time of fuzzing, we found several crashes in the extraction of several archive formats such as RAR, LZH and ACE that were caused by a memory corruption vulnerability such as Out-of-Bounds Write. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities, though, is not trivial because the primitives supplied limited control over the overwritten buffer.

However, a crash related to the parsing of the ACE format caught our eye. We found that WinRAR uses a dll named `unacev2.dll` for parsing ACE archives. A quick look at this dll revealed that it’s an old dated dll compiled in 2006 without a protection mechanism. In the end, it turned out that we didn’t even need to bypass them.

##### **Build a Specific Harness**

We decided to focus on this dll because it looked like it would be quick and easy to exploit.

Also, as far as WinRAR is concerned, as long as the archive file has a *.rar* extension, it would handle it according to the file’s magic bytes, in our case – the ACE format.

To improve the fuzzer performance, and to increase the coverage only on the relevant dll, we created a specific harness for `unacev2.dll` .

To do that, we need to understand how `unacev2.dll` is used. After reverse engineering the code calling `unacev2.dll` for ACE archive extraction, we found that two exported functions should be called for extraction in the following order:

1. An initialization function named `ACEInitDll`, with the following signature:

   `INT __stdcall ACEInitDll(unknown_struct_1 *struct_1);`

   • struct\_1: pointer to an unknown struct
2. An extraction function named `ACEExtract` , with the following signature:

   `INT __stdcall ACEExtract(LPSTR ArchiveName, unknown_struct_2 *struct_2);`•`ArchiveName`: string pointer to the path to the ace file to be extracted

   •`struct_2`: pointer to an unknown struct

Both of these functions required structs that are unknown to us. We had two options to try to understand the unknown struct: reversing and debugging WinRAR, or trying to find an open source project that uses those structs.

The first option is more time consuming, so we opted to try the second one. We searched github.com for the exported function `ACEInitDll`

and found a project named [FarManager](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager) that uses this dll and includes a detailed header file for the unknown structs.

**Note:** The creator of this project is also the creator of WinRAR.

After loading the header files to IDA, it was much easier to understand the previously “unknown structs” to both functions (`ACEInitDll` and `ACEExtract` ),  as IDA displayed the correct name and type for each struct member.

From the headers we found in the FarManager project, we came up with the following signature:

`INT __stdcall ACEInitDll([pACEInitDllStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/UNACEFNC.H#LC90) DllData);`

`INT __stdcall ACEExtract(LPSTR ArchiveName, [pACEExtractStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/UNACEFNC.H#LC194) Extract);`

To mimic the way that WinRAR uses `unacev2.dll` , we assigned the same struct member just as WinRAR did.

We started to fuzz this specific harness, but we didn’t find new crashes and the coverage did not expand in the first few hours of the fuzzing. We tried to understand the reason for this limitation.

We started by looking for information about the ACE archive format.

##### **Understanding the ACE Format**

We didn’t find a RFC for that format, but we did find vital information over the internet.

1. Creating an ACE archive is protected by a patent. The only software that is allowed to create an ACE archive is [`WinACE`](https://web.archive.org/web/20170714193504/http%3A/winace.com%3A80/). The last version of this program was compiled in November 2007. The company’s website has been down since August 2017. However, extracting an ACE archive is not protected by a patent.

2. A pure Python project named [`acefile`](https://pypi.org/project/%3Ccode%3Eacefile%3C/code%3E%20/) is mentioned in this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_%28compressed_file_format%29). Its most useful features are:

* It can extract an ACE archive.
* It contains a brief explanation about the ACE file format.
* It has a very helpful feature that prints the file format header with an explanation.

To understand the ACE file format, let’s create a simple `.txt` file (named “simple\_file.txt”), and compress it using `WinACE`. We will then check the headers of the ACE file using `acefile` .

This is **`simple_file.txt`**

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig3.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig3.png)

**Figure 3**: File before compression.

These are the options we selected in `WinACE`to create our example:

**Figure 4**: WinACE compression GUI.

This option creates the subdirectories `\users\nadavgr\Documents` under the chosen extraction directory and extracts simple\_file.txt to that relative path.

**`simple_file.ace`**

**Figure 5**: The simple\_file.ace produced using WinACE’s “store” compression option for visibility.

Running `acefile.py` from the [`acefile`](https://pypi.org/project/%3Ccode%3Eacefile%3C/code%3E%20/) project using headers flags displays information about the archive headers:

This results in:

**Figure 7**: acefile.py header parsing output.

Notes:

* Consider each “\\” from the `filename` field in the image above as a single slash “\”, this is just python escaping.
* For clarity, the same fields are marked with the same color in the hex dump and in the output from`acefile`.

Summary of the important fields:

* **hdr\_crc (marked in pink):**Two CRC fields are present in 2 headers. If the CRC doesn’t match the data, the extraction

  is interrupted. This is the reason why the fuzzer didn’t find more paths (expand its coverage).To “solve” this issue we patched all the CRC\* checks in `unacev2.dll` .\***Note** – The CRC is a [modified implementation](https://github.com/droe/acefile/blob/master/acefile.py#LC868) of the regular [CRC-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm).

* **filename (marked in green):**It contains the relative path to the file. All the directories specified in the relative path are created during the extracting process (including the file). The size of the `filename` is defined by 2 bytes (little endian) marked by a black frame in the hex dump.
* **advert (marked in yellow)**The advert field is automatically added by `WinACE`, during the creation of an ACE archive, if the archive is created using an unregistered version of `WinACE`.
* **file content:**
  + “`origsize` ” – The content’s size. The content itself is positioned after the header that defines the file (“hdr\_type” field == 1).
  + “`hdr_size` ” – The header size. Marked by a gray frame in the hex dump.
  + At offset 70 (0x46) from the second header, we can find our file content: “Hello From Check Point!”

Because the filename field contains the relative path to the file, we did some manual modification attempts to the field to see if it is vulnerable to “Path Traversal.”

For example, we added the trivial path traversal gadget “\..\” to the filename field and more complex “Path Traversal” tricks as well, but without success.

After patching all the structure checks, such as the CRC validation, we once again activated our fuzzer. After a short time of fuzzing, we entered the main fuzzing directory and found something odd. But let’s first describe our fuzzing machine for some necessary background.

#### **The Fuzzing Machine**

To increase the fuzzer performance and to prevent an I\O bottleneck, we used a RAM disk drive that uses the [ImDisk toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/) on the fuzzing machine.

The Ram disk is mapped to drive **R:\**, and the folder tree looks like this:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig8.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig8.png)

**Figure 8**: Fuzzer’s folders hierarchy

#### **Detecting the Path Traversal Bug**

A short time after starting the fuzzer, we found a new folder named sourbe in a surprising location, in the root of drive **R:\**

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig9-1024x528.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig9.png)

**Figure 9**: ”sourbe”, the unexpected folder which created during fuzzing.

The harness is instructed to extract the fuzzed archive to sub-directories under “output\_folders”. For example, `R:\ACE_FUZZER\output_folders\Slave_2\` . So why do we have a new folder created in the parent directory?

Inside the `sourbe` folder we found a file named `RED VERSION_¶` with the following content:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig10.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig10.png)

**Figure 10**: Content of the file that produced by the fuzzer in the unexpected path “R:\sourbe\RED VERSION\_¶”.

This is the hex dump of the test case that triggers the vulnerability:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig11.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig11.png)

**Figure 11**: A hex dump of the file that produced by the fuzzer in the unexpected path “R:\sourbe\RED VERSION\_¶”.

Notes:

* We made some minor changes to this test case, (such as adjusting the CRC) to make it parsable by `acefile`.
* For convenience, fields are marked with the same color in the hex dump and in

  the output from `acefile`.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig12.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig12.png)

**Figure 12**: Header parsing output from acefile.py for the file that produced by the fuzzer in the unexpected path.

These are the first three things that we noticed when we looked at the hex dump and the output from `acefile`:

1. The fuzzer copied parts of the “advert” field to other fields:
   * The content of the compressed file is “SIO”, marked in an orange frame in the hex dump. It’s part of the advert string “\*UNREGISTERED VER**SIO**N\*”.
   * The filename field contain the string “RED VERSION\*” which is part of the advert string “\*UNREGISTE**RED VERSION\***”.
2. The path in the `filename` field was used in the extraction process as an “absolute path” instead of a relative path to the destination folder (the backslash is the root of the drive).
3. The extract file name is “RED VERSION\_¶”. It seems that the asterisk from the `filename` field was converted to an underscore and the \x14\ (0x14) value represented as “¶” in the extract file name. The other content of the `filename` field is ignored because there is a null char which terminates the string, after the \x14\ (0x14) value.

To find the constraints that caused it to ignore the destination folder and use the `filename` field as an absolute path during the extraction, we did the following attempts, based on our assumptions.

Our first assumption was the first character of the `filename` field (the ‘\’ char) triggers the vulnerability. Unfortunately, after a quick check we found out that this is not the case. After additional checks we arrived at these conclusions:

1. The first char should be a ‘/’ or a ‘\’.
2. ‘\*’ should be included in the `filename` at least once; the location doesn’t matter.

Example of a `filename` field that triggers the bug: `\some_folder\some_file*.exe` will be extracted to `C:\some_folder\some_file_.exe` , and the asterisk is converted to an underscore (\_).

Now that it worked on our fuzzing harness, it is time to test our crafted archive (e.g. exploit file) file on WinRAR.

#### **Trying the exploit on WinRAR**

At first glance, it looked like the exploit worked as expected on WinRAR, because the `sourbe` directory was created in the root of drive `C:\` . However, when we entered the “sourbe” folder (`C:\sourbe` ) we noticed that the file was **not** created.

These behaviors raised two questions:

* Why did the harness and WinRAR behave differently?
* Why were the directories that were specified in the exploit file created, and the extracted file was not created?

##### **Why did the harness and WinRAR behave differently?**

We expected that the exploit file would behave the same on WinRAR as it behaved in our harness, for the following reasons:

1. The dll (`unacev2.dll` ) extracts the files to the destination folder, and not the outer executable (WinRAR or our harness).
2. Our harness mimics WinRAR perfectly when passing parameters / struct members to the dll.

A deeper look showed that we had a false assumption in our second point. Our harness defines 4 callbacks pointers, and our implemented callbacks differ from WinRAR’s callbacks. Let’s return to our harness implementation.

We mentioned this signature when calling the exported function named `ACEInitDll`.

`INT __stdcall ACEInitDll([pACEInitDllStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/UNACEFNC.H#LC90) DllData);`

`[pACEInitDllStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/UNACEFNC.H#LC90)` is a pointer to the `[sACEInitDLLStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/UNACEFNC.H#LC90)` struct. The first member of this struct is `[tACEGlobalDataStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/STRUCS.H#LC189)`. This struct has many members, including pointers to callback functions with the following signature:

`INT (__stdcall *InfoCallbackProc) ([pACEInfoCallbackProcStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/STRUCS.H#LC73) Info);`

`INT (__stdcall *ErrorCallbackProc) ([pACEErrorCallbackProcStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/STRUCS.H#LC76) Error);`

`INT (__stdcall *RequestCallbackProc) ([pACERequestCallbackProcStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/STRUCS.H#LC79) Request);`

`INT (__stdcall *StateCallbackProc) ([pACEStateCallbackProcStruc](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/STRUCS.H#LC82) State);`

These callbacks are called by the dll (`unacev2.dll` ) during the extraction process.

The callbacks are used as external validators for operations that about to happen, such as the creation of a file, creation of a directory, overwriting a file, etc.

The external callback/validators get information about the operation that’s about to occur, for example, file extraction, and returns its decision to the dll.

If the operation is allowed, the following constant is returned to the dll: [`ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_OK`](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/CALLBACK.H#LC110) Otherwise, if the operation is not allowed by the callback function, it returns the following constant: [`ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL`](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/CALLBACK.H#LC114), and the operation is aborted.

For more information about those callbacks function, see the [explanation](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/blob/806c80dff3e182c1c043fad9078490a9bf962456/plugins/newarc.ex/Modules/ace/Include/ACE/includes/CALLBACK.H#LC22) from the [FarManager](https://github.com/FarGroup/FarManager/).

Our harness returned `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_OK`  for all the callback functions except for the `ErrorCallbackProc`, where it returned `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL`.

It turns out, WinRAR does validation for the extracted `filename` (after they are extracted and created), and because of those validations in the WinRAR callback’s, the creation of the file was aborted. This means that after the file is created, it is deleted by WinRAR.

##### **WinRAR Validators / Callbacks**

This is part of the WinRAR callback’s validator pseudo-code that prevents the file creation:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig13.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig13.png)

**Figure 13**: WinRAR validator/callback pseudo-code.

“`SourceFileName`” represents the **relative path** to the file that will be extracted.

The function does the following checks:

1. The first char does not equal “`\`” or “`/`”.
2. The File Name doesn’t start with the following strings “`..\`” or “`../`” which are gadgets for “Path Traversal”.
3. The following “Path Traversal” gadgets does not exist in the string:
   1. “`\..\`”
   2. “`\../`”
   3. “`/../`”
   4. “`/..\`”

The extraction function in `unacv2.dll` calls `StateCallbackProc` in WinRAR, and passes the `filename` field of the ACE format as the relative path to be extracted to.

The relative path is checked by the WinRAR callback’s validator. The validators return `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL` to the dll, (because the `filename` field starts with backslash “\”) and the file creation is aborted.

The following string passes to the WinRAR callback’s validator:

“\sourbe\RED VERSION\_¶”

**Note**: This is the original filename with fields “\sourbe\RED VERSION\*¶”. “`unacev2.dll` ” replaces the “\*” with an underscore.

##### **Why were the folders that were specified in the exploit file created and the extracted file was not created?**

Because of a bug in the dll (“`unacev2.dll` ”), even if `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL` returned from the callback, the folders specified in the relative path (`filename` field in ACE archive) will be created by the dll.

The reason for this is that `unacev2.dll` calls the external validator (callback) before the folder creation, but it checks the return value from the callbacks too late – after the creation of the folder. Therefore, it aborts the extraction operation just before writing content to the extracted file, before the call to [WriteFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile) API.

It actually creates the extracted file, without writing content to it.  It calls to [CreateFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) API

and then checks the return code from the callback function. If the return code is `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL`, it actually deletes the file that previously created by the call to CreateFile API.

**Side Notes:**

* We found a way to bypass the deletion of the file, but it allows us to create empty files only. We can bypass the file deletion by adding “:” to the end of the file, which is treated as [Alternate Data Streams](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/24/alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs/). If the callback returns `ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL`, dll tries to delete the Alternate Data Stream of the file instead of the file itself.
* There is another filter function in the dll code that **aborts** the extraction operation if the relative path string starts with “**\**” (slash)**.** This happens in the first extraction stages, before the calls to any other filter function.

  However, by adding **“\*”**or “**?**” characters (wildcard characters) to the relative path (filename field) of the compressed file, this check is skipped and the code flow can continue and (partially) trigger the Path Traversal vulnerability. This is why the exploit file which was produced by the fuzzer triggered the bug in our harness. It doesn’t trigger the bug in WinRAR because of the callback validator in the WinRAR code.

#### **Summary of Intermediate Findings**

* We found a Path Traversal vulnerability in `unacev2.dll` . It enables our harness to extract the file to an arbitrary path, and completely ignore the destination folder, and treats the extracted file relative path as the full path.
* Two constraints lead to the Path Traversal vulnerability (summarized in previous sections):

  1. The first char should be a ‘/’ or a ‘\’.

  2. ‘\*’ should be included in the `filename` at least once. The location does not matter.
* WinRAR is partially vulnerable to the Path Traversal:
  + `unacev2.dll` doesn’t abort the operation after getting the abort code from the WinRAR callback (`ACE_CALLBACK_RETURN_CANCEL`). Due to this delayed check of the return code from WinRAR callback, the directories specified in the exploit file are created.
  + The extracted file is created as well, on the full path specified in the exploit file (without content), but it is deleted right after checking the returned code from the callback (before the call to WriteFile API).
  + We found a way to bypass the deletion of the file, but it allows us to create empty files only.

#### **Finding the Root Cause**

At this point, we wanted to figure out why the destination folder is ignored, and the relative path of the archive files (`filename` field) is treated as the full path.

To achieve this goal, we could use static analysis and debugging, but we decided on a much quicker method. We used [DynamoRio](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio) to record the code coverage in `unacev2.dll` of a regular ACE file and of our exploit file which triggered the bug. We then used the [lighthouse](https://github.com/gaasedelen/lighthouse) plugin for IDA and subtracted one coverage path from the other.

These are the results we got:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig14.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig14.png)

**Figure 14**: Lighthouse’s coverage overview window. You can see the coverage subtraction in the “Composer” form, and one result highlighted in purple.

In the “Coverage Overview” window we can see a single result. This means there is only one basic block that was executed in the first attempt (marked in A) and wasn’t reached on the second attempt (marked in B).

The Lighthouse plugin marked the background of the diffed basic block in blue, as you can see in the image below.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig15.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig15.png)

**Figure 15**: IDA graph view of the main bug in unacev2.dll. Lighthouse marked the background of the diffed basic block in blue.

From the code coverage results, you can understand that the exploit file is **not** going through the diffed basic block (marked in blue), but it takes the opposite basic block (the false condition, marked with a red arrow).

If the code flow goes through the false condition (red arrow) the line that is inside the green frame replaces the destination folder with `""` (empty string), and the later call to `sprintf` function, which concatenates the destination folder to the relative path of the extracted file.

The code flow to the true and false conditions, marked with green and red arrows respectively,

is influenced by the call to the function named `GetDevicePathLen` (inside the red frame).

If the result from the call to `GetDevicePathLen` equals 0, the `sprintf` looks like this:

`sprintf(final_file_path, "%s%s", destination_folder, file_relative_path);`

Otherwise:

`sprintf(final_file_path, "%s%s", "", file_relative_path);`

The last `sprintf` is the buggy code that triggers the Path Traversal vulnerability.

This means that the relative path will actually be treated as a fullpath to the file/directory that should be written/created.

Let’s look at **GetDevicePathLen** function to get a better understanding of the root cause:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig16.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig16.png)

**Figure 16**: GetDevicePathLen code.

The relative path of the extracted file is passed to `GetDevicePathLen`.

It checks if the device or drive name prefix appears in the Path parameter, and returns the length of that string, like this:

* The function returns **3** for this path: `C:\some_folder\some_file.ext`
* The function returns **1** for this path: `\some_folder\some_file.ext`
* The function returns **15** for this path: `\\LOCALHOST\C$\some_folder\some_file.ext`
* The function returns **21** for this path: `\\?\Harddisk0Volume1\some_folder\some_file.ext`
* The function returns **0** for this path: `some_folder\some_file.ext`

If the return value from `GetDevicePathLen` is greater than 0, the relative path of the extracted file will be considered as the full path, because the destination folder is replaced by  an empty string during the call to `sprintf`, and this leads to Path Traversal vulnerability.

However, there is a function that “cleans” the relative path of the extract file, by omitting any sequences that are not allowed before the call to `GetDevicePathLen`**.**

This is a pseudo-code that cleans the path “**`CleanPath`”.**

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig17.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig17.png)

**Figure 17**: Pseudo-code of CleanPath.

The function omits trivial Path Traversal sequences like “`\..\`”  (it only omits the “`..\`” sequence if it is found in the beginning of the path)  sequence, and it omits drive sequence like: “`C:\`”**,** “`C:`”, and for an unknown reason, “`C:\C:`” as well.

Note that it doesn’t care about the first letter; the following sequence will be omitted as well: “`_:\`”, “`_:`”, “`_:\_:`” (In this case underscore represents any value).

#### **Putting It All Together**

To create an exploit file, which causes WinRAR to extract an archived file to an arbitrary path (Path Traversal),  extract to the [Startup Folder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026268/windows-10-change-startup-apps) (which gains code execution after reboot) instead of to the destination folder.

We should bypass two filter functions to trigger the bug.

To trigger the concatenation of an empty string to the relative path of the compressed file, instead of the destination folder:

`sprintf(final_file_path, "%s%s", "", file_relative_path);`

Instead of:

`sprintf(final_file_path, "%s%s", destination_folder, file_relative_path);`

The result from `GetDevicePathLen` function should be greater than 0.

It depends on the content of the relative path (“**file\_relative\_path”**). If the relative path starts the device path this way:

* **option 1**: `C:\some_folder\some_file.ext`
* **option 2**: `\some_folder\some_file.ext` (The first slash represents the current drive.)

The return value from `GetDevicePathLen` will be greater than 0.

However, there is a filter function in `unacev2.dll` named `CleanPath` (Figure 17) that checks if the relative path starts with **C:\** and removes it from the relative path string before the call to `GetDevicePathLen`.

It omits the “`C:\`” sequence from the **option 1** string but **doesn’t** omit “**\**” sequence from the **option 2** string.

To overcome this limitation, we can add to **option 1** another “`C:\`” sequence which will be omitted by `CleanPath` (Figure 17), and leave the relative path to the string as we wanted with one “`C:\`”,  like:

* **option 1’**: **`C:\C:\`**`some_folder\some_file.ext`  **=>**  **`C:\`**`some_folder\some_file.ext`

However, there is a callback function in WinRAR code (Figure 13), that is used as a validator/filter function. During the extraction process, `unacev2.dll` is called to the callback function that resides in the WinRAR code.

The callback function validates the relative path of the compressed file. If the blacklist sequence is found, the extraction operation will be aborted.

One of the checks that is made by the callback function is for the relative path that starts with “**\**” (slash).

But it doesn’t check for the  “`C:\`”**.** Therefore, we can use **option 1’** to **exploit the Path Traversal Vulnerability!**

We also found an **SMB attack vector**, which enables it to connect to an arbitrary IP address and create files and folders in arbitrary paths on the SMB server.

Example:

`C:\\\10.10.10.10\smb_folder_name\some_folder\some_file.ext` **=>**`\\10.10.10.10\smb_folder_name\some_folder\some_file.ext`

#### **Example of a Simple Exploit File**

We change the .ace extension to .rar extension, because WinRAR detects the format by the content of the file and not by the extension.

This is the output from `acefile`**:**

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig18.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig18.png)

**Figure 18**: Header output by acefile.py of the simple exploit file.

We trigger the vulnerability by the crafted string of the `filename` field (in green).

This archive will be extracted to `C:\some_folder\some_file.txt` no matter what the path of the destination folder is.

#### **Creating a Real Exploit**

We can gain code execution, by extracting a compressed executable file from the ACE archive to one of the [Startup Folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026268/windows-10-change-startup-apps). Any files that reside in the Startup folders will be executed at boot time.

To craft an ACE archive that extracts its compressed files to the Startup folder seems to be trivial, but it’s not.

There are at least 2 Startup folders at the following paths:

1. `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`
2. `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

The first path of the Startup folder demands high privileges / high integrity level (in case the UAC is on). However, WinRAR runs by default with a medium integrity level.

The second path of the Startup folder demands to know the name of the user.

We can try to overcome it by creating an ACE archive with thousands of crafted compressed files, any one of which contains the path to the Startup folder but with different `<user name>`*,* and hope that it will work in our target.

#### **The Most Powerful Vector**

We have found a vector which allows us to extract a file to the Startup folder without caring about the `<user name>`**.**

By using the following `filename` field in the ACE archive:

**`C:\C:`**`C:../AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\some_file.exe`

It is translated to the following path by the `CleanPath` function (Figure 17):

`C:../AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\some_file.exe`

Because the `CleanPath` function removes the “**`C:\C:`** ” sequence**.**

Moreover, this destination folder will be ignored because the `GetDevicePathLen` function (Figure 16) will return 2 for the last “**C:**” sequence.

Let’s analyze the last path:

The sequence “`C:`” is translated by Windows to the “current directory” of the running process. In our case, it’s the current path of WinRAR.

If WinRAR is executed from its folder, the “current directory” will be this WinRAR folder: `C:\Program Files\WinRAR`

However, if WinRAR is executed by double clicking on an archive file or by right clicking on “extract” in the archive file, the “current directory” of WinRAR will be the path to the folder that the archive resides in.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig19.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig19.png)

**Figure 19**: WinRAR’s extract options (WinRAR’s shell extension added to right click)

For example, if the archive resides in the user’s Downloads folder, the “current directory” of WinRAR will be:

`C:\Users\<user name>\Downloads`

If the archive resides in the Desktop folder, the “current directory” path will be:

`C:\Users\<user name>\Desktop`

To get from the Desktop or Downloads folder to the Startup folder, we should go back one folder  “`../`” to the “user folder”, and concatenate  the relative path to the startup directory: `AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\` to the following sequence: “`C:../`”

This is the end result:  `C:../AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\some_file.exe`

Remember that there are 2 checks against path traversal sequences:

* In the `CleanPath` function which skips such sequences.
* In WinRAR’s callback function which aborts the extraction operation.

`CleanPath` checks for the following path traversal pattern: “`\..\`”

The WinRAR’s callback function checks for the following patterns:

1. `“\..\”`
2. `“\../”`
3. `“/../”`
4. `“/..\”`

Because the first slash or backslash are not part of our sequence “`C:../`”, we can bypass the path traversal validation. However, we can only go back one folder. It’s all we need to extract a file to the Startup folder without knowing the user name.

**Note**: If we want to go back more than one folder, we should concatenate the following sequence “`/../`”. For example, “`C:../../`” and the “`/../`” sequence will be caught be the callback validator function and the extraction will be aborted.

### **Demonstration (POC)**

#### **Side Note**

Toward the end of our research, we discovered that `WinACE` created an extraction utility like `unacev2.dll` for linux which is called unace-nonfree (compiled using Watcom compiler). The source code is available.

The source code for Windows (which `unacev2.dll` was built from) is included as well, but it’s older than the last version of `unacev2.dll` , and can’t be compiled/built for Windows. In addition,  some functionality is missing in the source code – for example, the checks in Figure 17 are not included.

However, Figure 16 was taken from the source code.

We also found the Path Traversal bug in the source code. It looks like this:

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig20.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fig20.png)

#### **WinRAR’s Response**

WinRAR decided to drop UNACEV2.dll from their package, and WinRAR doesn’t support ACE format from version number: “5.70 beta 1”.

Quote from [WinRAR website](https://www.win-rar.com/whatsnew.html?&L=0):

> ```
> “Nadav Grossman from Check Point Software Technologies informed us about a security vulnerability in UNACEV2.DLL library.
> Aforementioned vulnerability makes possible to create files in arbitrary folders inside or outside of destination folder
> when unpacking ACE archives.
> ```
> ```
> WinRAR used this third party library to unpack ACE archives.
> UNACEV2.DLL had not been updated since 2005 and we do not have access to its source code.
> So we decided to drop ACE archive format support to protect security of WinRAR users.
>
> We are thankful to Check Point Software Technologies for reporting  this issue.“

# CVE-2018-20250-WinRAR-ACE

Proof of concept code in C# to exploit the WinRAR ACE file extraction path (CVE-2018-20250).

# Resources

<https://research.checkpoint.com/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/>
<https://github.com/droe/acefile>
<https://apidoc.roe.ch/acefile/latest/>

# Dependencies

InvertedTomato.Crc (you can install it with NuGet) for the checksum method. You can use any other JAMCRC implementation.

# How to use

```
  AceVolume av = new AceVolume();
  AceFile f = new AceFile(
    @"D:\some_file.exe",
    @"C:\C:C:../AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\some_file.exe"
  );
  av.AddFile(f);
  av.Save("exploit.rar");
```

# Bugs

Seems that it only extracts to startup folder when the .rar file is in Desktop or any folder on the same level.

## About

# acefile - read/test/extract ACE 1.0 and 2.0 archives in pure python

Copyright (C) 2017-2024, [Daniel Roethlisberger](//daniel.roe.ch/).

<https://www.roe.ch/acefile>

## Synopsis

```
pip install acefile

# python library
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    f.extractall()

# unace utility
acefile-unace -x example.ace

```

## Overview

This single-file, pure python 3, no-dependencies implementation is intended
to be used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone unace utility.
As mostly pure-python implementation, it is significantly slower than
native implementations, but more robust against vulnerabilities.

This implementation supports up to version 2.0 of the ACE archive format,
including the EXE, DELTA, PIC and SOUND modes of ACE 2.0, password protected
archives and multi-volume archives. It does not support writing to archives.
It is an implementation from scratch, based on the 1998 document titled
"Technical information of the archiver ACE v1.2" by Marcel Lemke, using
unace 2.5 and WinAce 2.69 by Marcel Lemke as reference implementations.

For more information, API documentation, source code, packages and release
notifications, refer to:

* <https://www.roe.ch/acefile>
* <https://apidoc.roe.ch/acefile>
* <https://github.com/droe/acefile>
* <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/acefile>
* [https://infosec.exchange/@droe](https://infosec.exchange/%40droe)

## Requirements

Python 3. No other dependencies.

## Installation

```
pip install acefile

```

The `acefile` package includes an optional `acebitstream` module that
implements the bit stream class in c, resulting in a 50% speedup.
It is automatically used wherever it builds cleanly, but is not required.

## Library usage examples

Extract all files in the archive, with directories, to current working dir:

```
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    f.extractall()

```

Walk all files in the archive and test each one of them:

```
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    for member in f:
        if member.is_dir():
            continue
        if f.test(member):
            print("CRC OK:     %s" % member.filename)
        else:
            print("CRC FAIL:   %s" % member.filename)

```

In-memory decompression of a specific archive member:

```
import acefile
import io

filelike = io.BytesIO(b'\x73\x83\x31\x00\x00\x00\x90**ACE**\x14\x14' ...)
with acefile.open(filelike) as f:
    data = f.read('example.txt')

```

Handle archives potentially containing large members in chunks to avoid fully
reading them into memory:

```
import acefile

with acefile.open('large.ace') as fi:
    with open('large.iso', 'wb') as fo:
        for block in fi.readblocks('large.iso'):
            fo.write(block)

```

Check the [API documentation](https://apidoc.roe.ch/acefile) for a complete
description of the API.

## Utility usage examples

Extract all files in the archive, with directories, to current working dir:

```
acefile-unace -x example.ace

```

Test all files in the archive, verbosely:

```
acefile-unace -tv example.ace

```

List archive contents, verbosely:

```
acefile-unace -lv example.ace

```

Check usage for more functionality:

```
acefile-unace -h

```

decompression algorithms.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# WinRAR - What's new in the latest version

## Version 7.10 beta 3

```

   1. RAR compression algorithm can use multiple Windows processor groups
      to utilize up to maximum supported 64 logical processors.
      It can improve RAR compression speed on systems with logical
      processors number exceeding 64 and not multiple of 64.

      Previously the maximum number of logical processors was limited
      to a single processor group size, such as 36 for 72 processors.

   2. Tree panel uses the logical sorting for folders inside of archives.
      It treats digits in folder names by their numerical value, so folders
      are sorted as "1", "2", "10" instead of "1", "10", "2".
      Such sorting was already used for folders outside of archives.

   3. Dark mode visual improvements.

   4. Bugs fixed:

      a) if new files have been added to existing semi-solid RAR archive
         created with -se or -s switches, such files could be damaged.
         This issue doesn't affect usual solid archives created with -s,
         also as non-solid archives;

      b) if internal viewer "Autodetect encoding" option was on, a wrong
         encoding name could be displayed in the viewer status bar;

      c) compressing a network share top level folder from Explorer
         context menu failed with "Cannot open" error.

```
## Version 7.10 beta 2

```

   1. Numerous dark mode improvements and fixes.

   2. "Dark mode" options in "Settings/Interface" are renamed to "Color mode".

   3. It takes less time for WinRAR items in Windows 11 context menu to
      appear, when right clicking a lot of selected archives.

   4. Exporting settings with "Export settings to file" command
      of "Options/Import and export" submenu doesn't trigger
      User Account Control prompts anymore.

   5. "Bad archive" exit code 13 is returned in the command line mode,
      when attempting to unpack a non-RAR archive with .rar file extension.

   6. "External viewer name" field in "Settings/Viewer" recognizes "\", "..\"
      or ".\" in the beginning of path, allowing to specify paths relative
      to WinRAR program folder. Paths like \utils\viewer.exe, ..\viewer.exe
      or .\viewer.exe can be helpful for WinRAR installation on USB drive
      without a fixed drive letter

   7. Bugs fixed:

      a) compression speed could be lower than expected for rare specific
         combination of source data in a non-solid archive;

      b) console RAR fell into infinite loop, when trying to process user
         input in prompts like the overwrite prompt in Windows 7;

      c) running executables from archive subfolders failed with
         "Cannot execute" error;

      d) WinRAR.ini contents could be reset if "Reuse existing window" option
         was on and multiple archives were opened in the same WinRAR window.

```
## Version 7.10 beta 1

```

   1. "Settings/General" dialog page is split to "Settings/Interface"
      and "Settings/System" pages. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs
      instead of horizontal.

   2. WinRAR sets the dark interface mode if "Dark mode" option
      in "Settings/Interface" is on. This option can enable or disable
      the dark mode unconditionally or use Windows dark mode settings.

   3. "Large memory pages" option in "Settings/System" dialog and -mlp
      command line switch enable using 2 MB memory pages instead of
      default 4 KB, when allocating large memory areas in RAR archive
      format compression and extraction routines.

      It allows to improve archiving and, in some cases, extraction speed.
      Typically the performance gain is more significant for bigger
      compression dictionaries and slower compression methods.

      This feature requires "Lock pages in memory" privilege
      and if it is missing, WinRAR proposes to assign it to the current
      user account, making it available for other software too.
      Windows restart is necessary to activate the newly assigned privilege.

   4. "Zone value only" option in "Settings/Security" dialog controls
      if archive Mark of the Web propagation includes only the security zone
      value or all available fields.

      While additional fields, such as a download location or IP address,
      might help to identify a file source, they can be a privacy concern
      if file is shared with other persons.

   5. Switch -om[-|1][=list] controls Mark of the Web propagation
      in WinRAR and console RAR command line mode.

   6. Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows are not supported anymore.
      WinRAR and WinRAR self-extracting modules require Windows 7 x64
      or later.

   7. "Auto", "Always on" and "Disable" choices are now available
      for "Delta compression" and "x86 executable compression" options
      in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog.

      To improve the compression speed, "Auto" applies these options
      depending on the compression method, such as disabling them
      for "Fastest" and "Fast" methods. Use "Always on" to enable them
      for all methods.

   8. Name of environment variable to store the default set of RAR switches
      is changed from "RAR" to "RARINISWITCHES". It is rather typical
      for batch scripts to use "RAR" environment variable name to store
      RAR executable pathname, which led to the name conflict previously.

   9. "Completion message title" and "Completion message text" options
      on "Text" page of "Advanced SFX options" dialog allow to define
      a custom message displayed on the successful completion of SFX archive
      extraction.

      This message can also be added with "TextDone" script command.

      SFX logo and icon options are moved to the new "Logo and icon" page
      of "Advanced SFX options" dialog. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs
      instead of horizontal.

  10. Windows 11 context menu:

      a) compression profiles in the new context menu are placed above
         extraction commands, similarly to the legacy context menu;

      b) separator lines are inserted between archive open, extraction
         and archiving command groups.

  11. When extracting a file with NTFS "Compressed" attribute,
      this attribute is assigned in the beginning of file extraction.
      Typically it reduces the extraction time compared to assigning it
      after writing the file data.

  12. When adding files to existing RAR archive, folders previously stored
      in such archive are moved to a position after newly added files.
      So folder timestamps are set after extracting all files and are not
      modified when creating files inside of these folders.

  13. Temporary file isn't created anymore for "rar ch -tl" command
      if no archive modification switches like -rr or -z have been specified.
      Modification time of newest archived file is set directly to original
      archive file, without copying the archive data. It reduces disk write
      and processing time.

  14. If archive is truncated at recovery record or quick open information
      service blocks, the additional message with truncated block type
      is displayed after the standard "Unexpected end of archive".

  15. Bugs fixed:

      a) even though the long range search isn't used with -m1 "fastest"
         compression method, switches -m1 -mcl+ or -m1 -mcl with 256MB
         or larger compression dictionary still allocated memory required
         for long range search algorithm;

      b) if "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option was on
         when extracting a file from archive subfolder, clicking on ".."
         in the file list afterwards displayed the folder with the archive
         file instead of parent folder inside of archive;

      c) if application was started from archive and created multiple files
         with monotonically growing date, WinRAR could issue archive update
         prompts for every created file instead of a single prompt.

```
## Version 7.01

```

  1. Bugs fixed:

      a) updating an encrypted file in a solid RAR archive produced
         a corrupt archive if updated file was the first in archive,
         no password was specified when starting updating and file name
         encryption in the updated archive wasn't enabled;

      b) WinRAR 7.00 crashed after switching to "Flat folders view" mode
         from archive subfolder;

      c) switch -ep4 duplicated the specified path instead of excluding it
         when extracting;

      d) if archive created by Unix RAR version contained symlinks with
         path separator characters in target paths, these characters could be
         broken when modifying such archive with Windows RAR;

      e) invalid file name was displayed in file rename and file execute
         WinRAR error messages;

      f) SFX "Shortcut" command failed to recognize empty parameters
         defined like "Shortcut=D,"",folder", while correctly recognizing
         such parameters without quote marks like "Shortcut=D,,folder";

      g) volume reconstruction didn't work in WinRAR.exe if "rc" command
         was specified with .rev file, such as "WinRAR rc arc.part1.rev".
         Unlike RAR, WinRAR required to use only .rar file name here.

```
## Version 7.00

```

   1. Compression dictionary sizes larger than 1 GB are supported
      for RAR archive format. Depending on the amount of physically
      available memory, dictionary up to 64 GB can be selected.

      Not power of 2 dictionary sizes can be specified for dictionaries
      exceeding 4 GB. So we are not limited to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 series
      and can use values like 5 GB or 22 GB.

      Archives with dictionaries exceeding 4 GB can be unpacked only
      by WinRAR 7.0 or newer. 64-bit WinRAR version is needed to unpack
      archives with dictionaries exceeding 1 GB.

      Increasing the dictionary size can improve the compression ratio
      for large files with distant repeated blocks, like virtual machine
      disk images. It also can be efficient for sets of large similar files
      in a solid archive, such as a collection of software ISO images
      differing by version or localization.

   2. WinRAR issues a prompt allowing to cancel or continue if dictionary
      size in extracted RAR archive exceeds "Maximum dictionary size
      allowed to extract" parameter in "Settings/Compression".
      It is done to prevent the unexpected excessive memory allocation.

      In the command line mode by default WinRAR refuses to unpack archives
      with dictionary exceeding 4 GB. Use -md or -mdx to allow
      unpacking dictionaries up to and including the specified size.
      Unlike -md, -mdx is applied to extraction only and can be
      added to RAR environment variable, not affecting archiving commands.

   3. "Define dictionary sizes" dialog in "Settings/Compression" can be used
      to customize dictionary sizes proposed in the drop down list associated
      with "Dictionary size" field in "Archive name and parameters" dialog.

   4. Alternate search algorithm, optimized to locate longer and more distant
      repeated data blocks, can be used when creating RAR archives.
      It helps to improve the compression ratio and sometimes speed
      for redundant data like big text files.

      It increases memory usage and might reduce the compression speed
      for some types of data. It can be turned on or off with
      "Long range search" options in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog
      or with -mcl[+|-] switch. If "Auto" option is selected, WinRAR applies
      the long range search depending on the compression method, dictionary
      size and other parameters.

      This algorithm is required for dictionaries exceeding 4 GB
      and turning it off is ignored for such dictionaries.

   5. Much slower and more exhaustive repeated data search and compression
      algorithm can be enabled with "Exhaustive search" option
      in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog or with -mcx switch.
      It might provide the additional compression gain for some types of
      redundant data, but at much lower compression speed.

      Long range search is needed to implement this mode efficiently,
      so the exhaustive search option activates it automatically.

      Both long range and exhaustive search option do not affect
      the compatibility of created archives. So if dictionary size
      is in 128 KB - 4 GB range, archives created with these search options
      can be unpacked by all WinRAR versions beginning from 5.0.

   6. Maximum path length limit is increased from 2047 to 65535 characters.

   7. Creating archives in RAR 4.x format isn't supported anymore.
      Options and switches specific for this format are removed.
      It doesn't affect RAR 4.x archives decompression, which is included
      into WinRAR.

   8. "Propagate Mark of the Web" option in "Settings/Security" dialog
      controls assigning the archive Mark of the Web to extracted files.
      It is possible to prohibit propagating, allow it for several
      predefined file groups, for all files or for files matching user
      defined file masks.

      Mark of the Web is the security zone information added by Internet
      browsers to downloaded files. It can be used by various software
      for security purposes.

      It is supported only by GUI WinRAR. Console RAR doesn't propagate
      Mark of the Web regardless of this option.

   9. "Attributes" column can be enabled in "Settings/File list/Columns".
      It displays file attribute abbreviations, such as 'A' for "Archive"
      and 'D' for directory.

      If file attribute isn't among those recognized by WinRAR,
      the numeric value of file attributes is also displayed.
      This value uses hexadecimal format for Windows attributes
      or octal format for Unix attributes.

  10. "Benchmark" command allows to specify the exact number of threads
      and copy results to clipboard. Information about WinRAR and Windows
      versions, CPU and memory is added to benchmark window.

  11. "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option
      in "Settings/Paths" is now applicable also to extraction commands
      invoked from WinRAR user interface and to multiple archives
      unpacked to separate folders. It removes a destination path
      component, only if its name matches both the archive name and root
      archived folder name, provided that there are no other folders
      or files in archive root.

      For example, it will remove one of "Pictures" in the destination path
      if we unpack Pictures.rar containing the root "Pictures" folder
      to "Pictures\" destination.

      Previously it worked only for a single archive extracted from
      context menu and didn't check if archived folder name matches
      the last destination path component.

  12. "Word wrap in comment" option in "Interface" options group
      in "Settings/General" toggles the word wrap mode in archive comment
      window.

  13. Dictionary size data in archive information dialog is now available
      for .bz2, .lz, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz, .tar.lz, .tar.zst archives.

  14. Switch -ol- prohibits archiving and extracting symbolic links.

  15. Switches -sl[u] and -sm[u] recognize [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T]
      size units for kilobytes, thousands of bytes, megabytes, millions
      of bytes, gigabytes, billions of bytes, terabytes, trillions of bytes.
      If unit character is 'b', 'B' or not present, bytes are assumed.

      Previously these switches accepted bytes only.

  16. SFX TempMode command accepts the optional @set:user parameter
      allowing to modify temporary folder permissions, so only the current
      user can access it. It prohibits a local user to replace files
      in a temporary folder if SFX is started under another account.

      It also can be enabled with "Restrict folder access" option
      in "Advanced SFX options/Modes" dialog.

      Some installers might fail to start in a folder created with
      @set:user parameter.

  17. File permissions and NTFS alternate streams are not saved for
      hard link entries. They are saved only for the source file these
      entries refer to. It allows to reduce the archive size, because
      such file properties are automatically propagated to hard links
      copies when extracting.

  18. Keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl+A to select all files or Alt+E to
      unpack found archives, are now functional in "Search results" window
      also while search is still in progress. Previously they were available
      only after completing search.

  19. Switch -v[unit] recognizes 't' and 'T' as terabytes and
      trillions of bytes for volume size units.

  20. Warning is issued if leading '-' character is missing in a parameter
      specified in "Additional switches" field of WinRAR archiving
      and extraction dialogs. Also it is issued for parameters lacking '-'
      in RAR environment variable and rar.ini file.

      Previously such malformed parameters were ignored silently.

  21. "Convert archives" command displays the smooth total operation progress.
      Previously the total progress was updated abruptly after converting
      an archive and was visible only when processing multiple archives.

  22. Proper progress is displayed when compressing symbolic link targets.

  23. "Integrate WinRAR into shell" option in WinRAR "Settings/Integration"
      is grayed out if "Global\Integration=0" is present in winrar.ini file.

  24. 64-bit WinRAR version uses 64-bit SFX modules by default.
      64-bit SFX modules are needed to unpack archives with dictionaries
      exceeding 1 GB.

      32-bit modules are renamed to Default32.SFX, Zip32.SFX, WinCon32.SFX.

  25. Maximum allowed dictionary size for archiving and extraction
      can be specified in gigabytes in MaxDictA and MaxDictE variables
      in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Policy" Registry key.
      If these variables are smaller than corresponding values defined
      in WinRAR interface, they override interface values.

  26. Console RAR filters out character 27 from screen output. It is done
      for security reasons, because this character can be used to declare
      ANSI escape control sequences in some terminal applications.

      We are thankful to Siddharth Dushantha for bringing this issue
      to our attention.

  27. Bugs fixed:

      a) it was possible to overwrite Mark of the Web, propagated from
         archive to extracted files, and modify its security zone information
         utilizing a specially crafted .rar archive.

         We are thankful to Orange Tsai and NiNi from DEVCORE Research Team
         working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for letting us know
         about this security issue.

         Unlike WinRAR, unrar.dll library doesn't propagate the archive
         Mark of the Web and leaves it to a caller application to assign it
         to extracted files. So unrar.dll isn't affected by this issue;

      b) "User defined archive extensions" field in "Settings/Integration"
         was not saved if winrar.ini was used to store settings
         and WinRAR was started under non-administrator user account.

```
## Version 6.24

```

1. Bugs fixed:

      a) WinRAR and UnRAR.dll extraction command dereferenced a null pointer
         and crashed when processing a zero length archive name
         in the archive metadata stored with -am switch.

         We are thankful to Radoslaw Madej from Check Point software
         for reporting this issue;

      b) WinRAR and UnRAR.dll extraction command overwrote extracted file
         data with contents of ::$DATA NTFS alternate data stream,
         if such stream was present in the archive. In this case
         unpacked data size and checksum could mismatch file size
         and checksum displayed in WinRAR file list. It didn't affect
         file name and type, which were displayed properly.

         We are thankful to Ata Hakcil for reporting this issue.

```
## Version 6.23

```

   1. Added extraction of XZ archives utilizing ARM64 filter.

   2. Rar$LS* temporary files, created when extracting or testing multiple
      archives from Windows context menu, are now deleted immediately.
      Previously they were deleted only on next WinRAR runs and only
      if they were at least 1 hour old.

   3. Bugs fixed:

      a) a security issue involving out of bounds write is fixed
         in RAR4 recovery volumes processing code.

         We are thankful to goodbyeselene working with Trend Micro Zero Day
         Initiative for letting us know about this bug;

      b) WinRAR could start a wrong file after a user double clicked
         an item in a specially crafted archive.

         We are thankful to Andrey Polovinkin from Group-IB Threat
         Intelligence unit for letting us know about this bug;

      c) if both NTFS and Unix time extra fields were available for a file
         in ZIP archive, extraction command ignored the second extra field
         even if it provided more time fields than first one;

      d) interface themes were applied to archive icons even if
         "Apply to archive icons" option in "Organize themes" dialog
         was turned off.

   4. win.rar GmbH highly recommends to install the latest version of WinRAR 6.23.
       You will find the latest version here: https://www.win-rar.com/download.html

```
## Version 6.22

```

   1. Bugs fixed:

      a) extracting individual files from solid archives created by
         RAR versions older than 2.0, could fail in WinRAR 6.20 and 6.21.
         It didn't affect extracting the entire archive, which was performed
         correctly;

      b) files in Unix ARJ archives could be erroneously displayed as folders
         in WinRAR file list;

      c) "Display files in Explorer" extraction option was ignored
         if "When done: Close WinRAR" option was also set and archive
         was opened in WinRAR before extracting;

      d) file size value in the internal viewer status bar didn't include
         the byte order mask field, displaying a smaller than actual size
         for Unicode files.

```
## Version 6.21

```

   1. Both file and folder modification timestamps are restored
      when unpacking TAR and TAR based archives like tar.gz and tar.bz2.
      Previously only file modification timestamps were set
      for these archive formats.

   2. Added decompression of .tar.zst archives with dictionary
      exceeding 128 MB. WinRAR 6.20 allowed such dictionary for .zst,
      but not for .tar.zst.

   3. Switches -ed and -e+d are also supported by ZIP archives.
      Previously they worked only for RAR archives.

   4. Bugs fixed:

      a) if unencrypted file was stored after encrypted in the same
         RAR archive and both files had been unpacked in the same extraction
         command, WinRAR 6.20 failed to unpack the unencrypted file;

      b) in some cases a wrong detailed reason of file open error could be
         displayed in the second line of open error message.

```
## Version 6.20

```

   1. If "Autodetect passwords" option in "Organizer passwords" dialog
      is enabled and password matching a processing archive is present
      among saved passwords, it is applied automatically. This option
      is applicable only for archives in RAR 5.0 and ZIP formats,
      which allow to verify the password validity quickly.

      There is a minor chance of incorrect password detection
      for ZIP archives if stored passwords do not include a proper one.
      If encrypted ZIP archive extraction fails, you can try to disable
      this option, repeat extraction and enter a valid password manually.

   2. If extraction command involves only a part of files in RAR archive,
      the additional archive analysis is performed when starting extraction.
      It helps to properly unpack file references even if reference source
      is not selected. It works for most of RAR archives except for volumes
      on multiple removable media and archives containing a very large
      number of references.

      Also in some cases such analysis may help to optimize the amount
      of processing data when extracting individual files from
      semi-solid archives created with -s and -se switches.

   3. "Save original archive name and time" option on "Options" page
      of archiving dialog allows to save the original archive name
      and creation time. If archive includes such saved name and time,
      they are displayed on "Info" page of "Show information" command
      and can be restored on "Options" page of same command.
      Restoring involves renaming an archive to original name and setting
      the saved time as the archive creation and modification time.

      Switch -ams or just -am together with archive modification commands
      can be used to save the archive name and time in the command line mode.
      These saved parameters are displayed in header of "l" and "v" commands
      output and can be restored with -amr switch combined with "ch" command,
      such as "rar ch -amr arc.rar". If -amr is specified, "ch" ignores
      other archive modification switches.

   4. Faster RAR5 compression of poorly compressible data on modern CPUs
      with 8 or more execution threads. This applies to all methods
      except "Fastest", which performance remains the same.

   5. "Repair" command efficiency is improved for shuffled data blocks
      in recovery record protected RAR5 archives.

   6. If file size has grown after archiving when creating non-solid
      RAR volumes, such file is stored without compression regardless of
      volume number, provided that file isn't split between volumes.
      Previously it worked only for files in the first volume.

   7. Added decompression of .zipx archives containing file references,
      provided that both reference source and target are selected
      and reference source precedes the target inside of archive.

      Typically, if .zipx archive includes file references, it is necessary
      to unpack the entire archive to extract references successfully.

   8. Added decompression of .zst long range mode archives with dictionary
      exceeding 128 MB. Previously it was possible to decompress them only
      if dictionary was 128 MB or less.

   9. If "Turn PC off", "Hibernate", "Sleep" or "Restart PC" archiving
      options are enabled in WinRAR, a prompt to confirm or cancel
      such power management action is displayed directly before starting it.
      If no selection was made by user for 30 seconds, the proposed action
      is confirmed and started automatically.

      This prompt is also displayed for -ioff switch in WinRAR command line,
      but not in console RAR command line.

  10. Context menu in WinRAR file list provides "Open in internal viewer"
      command for archive files. It can be helpful if you wish to view
      the archive raw data in internal viewer. For example, to read
      an email archive with UUE attachments included.

      Usual "View" command always displays the archive contents.
      If file is recognized as UUE archive, "View" would show UUE attachments.

  11. Recovery record size is displayed on "Archive" page of file properties
      invoked from Explorer context menu for archives in RAR5 format.
      Previously there was only "Present" instead of exact size
      for RAR5 archives.

  12. When archiving from stdin with -si switch, RAR displays the current
      amount of read bytes as the progress indicator.

  13. If wrong password is specified when adding files to encrypted
      solid RAR5 archive, a password will be requested again.
      Previous versions cancelled archiving in this case.

  14. If both options "Test archived files" and "Clear attribute "Archive"
      after compressing" or their command line -t -ac equivalents are
      enabled when archiving, "Archive" attribute will be cleared only
      if test was completed successfully. Previously it was cleared even
      when test reported errors.

  15. NoDrives value containing the bit mask to hide drives can be now
      read from "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Policy" Registry key,
      which allows to include it to winrar.ini if necessary.
      Its "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies" locations
      in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE are also supported.

      Previously only "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies"
      in HKEY_CURRENT_USER was recognized.

  16. Bugs fixed:

      a) archive modification commands could fail for some ZIP archives
         with file comments;

      b) fixed a memory leak when reading contents of .tar.bz2 archives;

      c) if source and resulting archive format is the same, the archive
         conversion command didn't set the original archive time
         to a newly created archive even if "Original archive time" option
         was selected in archiving parameters;

      d) if "Merge volumes contents" option in "Settings/File list" was
         turned on, the folder packed size in WinRAR file list could be
         less than expected when browsing a multivolume archive contents.
         It didn't include the packed size of file parts continuing from
         previous volume into calculation;

      e) even if "Set file security" extraction option was turned off
         by default, extraction commands in Explorer context menu still
         attempted to restore NTFS file security data;

      f) WinRAR could read data beyond the end of buffer and crash
         when unpacking files from specially crafted ZIP archive.
         We are thankful to Bakker working with Trend Micro Zero Day
         Initiative for letting us know about this bug.

```
## Version 6.11

```

   1. Added support for Gz archives with large archive comments.
      Previously the extraction command failed to unpack gz archives
      if comment size exceeded 16 KB.

   2. Archive comments in gz archives are displayed in the comment window
      and recognized by "Show information" command. Large comments are
      shown partially.

      Previous versions didn't display Gzip comments.

   3. Reserved device names followed by file extension, such as aux.txt,
      are extracted as is in Windows 11 even without "Allow potentially
      incompatible names" option or -oni command line switch.
      Unlike previous Windows versions, Windows 11 treats such names
      as usual files.

      Device names without extension, such as aux, still require these
      options to be unpacked as is regardless of Windows version.

   4. Switch -mes can be also used to suppress the password prompt
      and abort when adding files to encrypted solid archive.

   5. Additional measures to prevent extracting insecure links are
      implemented.

   6. Bugs fixed:

      a) if password exceeding 127 characters was entered when unpacking
         an encrypted archive with console RAR, text after 127th character
         could be erroneously recognized as user's input by different
         prompts issued later;

      b) wrong archived file time could be displayed in overwrite prompt
         when extracting a file from ZIP archive. It happened if such
         archive included extended file times and was created in another
         time zone. It didn't affect the actual file time, which was set
         properly upon extraction.

```
## Version 6.10

```

   1. WinRAR can unpack contents of .zst and .zipx archives utilizing
      Zstandard algorithm.

   2. Added support of Windows 11 Explorer context menus.

      Beginning from Windows 11, an application can add only a single top
      level command or submenu to Explorer context menu.

      If "Cascaded context menus" in "Integration settings" dialog is on,
      this single item is a submenu storing all necessary WinRAR commands.

      If this option is off, only one extraction command for archives
      and one archiving command for usual files are available.
      You can select these commands with "Context menu items..." button
      in "Integration settings" dialog.

   3. "Legacy context menus" option in "Settings/Integration" dialog
      can be used in Windows 11 if WinRAR commands are missing in
      "Show more options" Windows legacy context menu or in context menus
      of third party file managers. If WinRAR commands are already present
      here, keep "Legacy context menus" option turned off to prevent
      duplicating them.

      This option is not available in Windows 10 and older.

   4. Windows XP is not supported anymore. Minimum required operating
      system version is Windows Vista.

   5. "Close" item is added to "When done" list on "Advanced" page of
      archiving dialog. It closes WinRAR window, when archiving is done.

   6. "When done" list is added to "Options" page of extraction dialog.
      It allows to select an action like turning a computer off
      or closing WinRAR after completing extraction.

   7. Switch -si can be used when extracting or testing to read archive
      data from stdin, such as:

        type docs.rar | rar x -si -o+ -pmypwd dummy docs\

      Even though the archive name is ignored with this switch,
      an arbitrary dummy archive name has to specified in the command line.

      Operations requiring backward seeks are unavailable in this mode.
      It includes displaying archive comments, testing the recovery record,
      utilizing the quick open information, processing multivolume archives.

      Prompts requiring user interaction are not allowed.
      Use -o[+|-|r], -p or -mes switches to suppress such prompts.

   8. New -ep4 switch excludes the path prefix when archiving
      or extracting if this path is found in the beginning of archived name.
      Path is compared with names already prepared to store in archive,
      without drive letters and leading path separators. For example:

        rar a -ep4texts\books archive c:\texts\books\technical

      removes "text\books" from archived names, so they start
      from 'technical'.

   9. New -mes switch skips encrypted files when extracting or testing.
      It replaces the former -p- switch.

  10. New -op switch sets the destination folder for 'x' and 'e'
      extraction commands. Unlike  command line parameter,
      this switch also accepts paths without trailing path separator
      character.

  11. If 'p' command is used to print a file to stdout, informational
      messages are suppressed automatically to prevent them mixing
      with file data.

  12. "Generate archive name by mask" option and switch -ag treat only
      first two 'M' characters after 'H' as minutes. Previously any
      amount of such characters was considered as minutes.

      It makes possible to place the time field before the date,
      like -agHHMM-DDMMYY. Previous versions considered all 'M'
      in this string as minutes.

  13. Maximum allowed size of RAR5 recovery record is increased to 1000%
      of protected data size. Maximum number of RAR5 recovery volumes
      can be 10 times larger than protected RAR volumes.

      Previous WinRAR versions are not able to use the recovery record
      to repair broken archives if recovery record size exceeds 99%.
      Similarly, previous versions cannot use recovery volumes
      if their number is equal or larger than number of RAR volumes.

  14. Warning is issued if entered password exceeds the allowed limit
      of 127 characters and is truncated. Previously such passwords
      had been truncated silently.

  15. If archive includes reserved device names, the underscore character
      is inserted in the beginning of such names when extracting.
      For example, aux.txt is converted to _aux.txt. It is done to prevent
      compatibility problems with software unable to process such names.

      You can use "Allow potentially incompatible names" option
      in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog or command line -oni switch
      to avoid this conversion.

  16. WinRAR attempts to reset the file cache before testing an archive.
      It helps to verify actual data written to disk instead of reading
      a cached copy.

  17. Multiple -v switches specifying different sizes for different
      volumes are now allowed also for ZIP archives:

      WinRAR a -v100k -v200k -v300k arcname.zip

      Previously multiple -v switches were supported only for
      RAR archives.

  18. Switches -sl and -sm can be used in WinRAR.exe command
      line mode when extracting archives in any supported formats,
      provided that such archive includes unpacked file sizes.
      Previously these switches could filter files by size only in RAR
      and ZIP archives.

  19. Newer folder selection dialog is invoked when pressing "Browse" button
      in WinRAR "Settings/Paths" page, "Repair" and "Convert" commands,
      also as in few other similar places. Previously a simpler XP style
      folder selection dialog was opened.

  20. When restoring from tray after completing an operation,
      WinRAR window is positioned under other opened windows,
      to not interfere with current user activities.

  21. "650 MB CD" is removed and "2 GB volumes" is added to the list of
      predefined volume sizes in "Define volume sizes" dialog invoked
      from WinRAR "Settings/Compression".

  22. "Rename" command selects the file name part up to the final dot.
      Previously it selected the entire name.

  23. If SFX archive size exceeds 4 GB, an error message is issued
      during compression, immediately after exceeding this threshold.
      Previously this error was reported only after completing compression.

      Executables of such size cannot be started by Windows.

  24. Command line -en switch is not supported anymore.
      It created RAR4 archives without the end of archive record.

      End of archive record permits to gracefully skip external data
      like digital signatures.

  25. Bugs fixed:

      a) when editing a file inside of .rar or .zip archive,
         WinRAR created a new SFX archive instead of updating an existing
         archive if "Create SFX archive" option was set in the default
         compression profile;

      b) the total progress could be displayed incorrectly when using
         -oi, -f, -u switches or appropriate GUI options;

      c) "Find files" command with "Use all tables" option and command line
         "it" commands failed to find strings in UTF-16 encoding.

```
## Version 6.02

```

   1. ZIP SFX module refuses to process SFX commands stored in archive
      comment if such comment is resided after beginning of Authenticode
      digital signature. It is done to prevent possible attacks with
      inclusion of ZIP archive into the signature body.

      We already prohibited extracting contents of such malformed archives
      in WinRAR 6.01.

      We are thankful to Jacob Thompson - Mandiant Advantage Labs
      for reporting this issue.

   2. WinRAR uses https instead of http in the web notifier window,
      home page and themes links. It also implements additional checks
      within the web notifier. This is done to prevent a malicious web page
      from executing existing files on a user's computer. Such attack
      is only possible if the intruder has managed to spoof or otherwise
      control user's DNS records. Some other factors are also involved
      in limiting the practical application of this attack.

      We would like to express our gratitude to Igor Sak-Sakovskiy
      for bringing this issue to our attention.

   3. Where appropriate, SFX archive displays the additional line
      with detailed error information provided by operating system.

      For example, previously such archive would display "Cannot create file"
      message alone. Now this message is followed by a detailed reason
      like access denied or file being used by another process.

      In the past this extended error information was available in WinRAR,
      but not in SFX archives.

   4. Switch -idn hides archived names also in 'v' and 'l' commands.
      It can be useful if only the archive type or total information
      is needed.

   5. If -ibck -ri switches are used together, WinRAR process
      sets the priority specified in -ri switch. Previous versions ignored
      -ri and set the priority to low in the presence of -ibck switch.

   6. When using "File/Change drive" command, WinRAR saves the last folder
      of previous drive and restores it if that drive is selected again
      later.

   7. Name of unpacking file is now included into WinRAR incorrect password
      warning for RAR5 archives. It can be helpful when unpacking
      a non-solid archive containing files encrypted with different passwords.

   8. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Convert archives" command issued erroneous "The specified password
         is incorrect" message after succesfully converting RAR archive
         with encrypted file names if new password was set and archive
         was opened in WinRAR shell;

      b) if command progress window was resized up and then quickly resized
         down to original dimensions, window contents could be positioned
         incorrectly.

```
## Version 6.01

```

   1. Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut selects the entire text in WinRAR comment
      window.

   2. If -idn switch is used together with -t or -df in console RAR
      when archiving, it additionally disables "Deleting <filename>"
      or "Testing <filename>" messages, normally issued by these switches.

      Also -idn disables folder creation messages when extracting
      a file to non-existing folder.

   3. WinRAR and ZIP SFX module refuse to extract contents of ZIP SFX
      archives if ZIP central directory is resided after beginning
      of Authenticode digital signature. It is done to prevent possible
      attacks with inclusion of ZIP archive into signature body.

   4. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Convert archives" command could incorrectly convert Unicode
         comments in RAR archives.

      b) if two archive information windows had been opened from Explorer
         context menu, the compression ratio bar in the first window
         could erroneously display a value for second archive.

         It did not affect the ratio and other text details at the right
         of window. Only the vertical bar at the left could be updated
         to a wrong value;

      c) if "Wait if other WinRAR copies are active" option was enabled
         in extraction dialog, "Waiting for another WinRAR copy" title
         was not set in command progress window while waiting;

      d) when extracting a symbolic link, previous versions did not
         overwrite existing symbolic links even if user requested it
         in overwrite prompt.

```
## Version 6.00

```

   1. "Ignore" and "Ignore All" options are added to read error prompt.
      "Ignore" allows to continue processing with already read file part
      only and "Ignore All" does it for all future read errors.

      For example, if you archive a file, which portion is locked by another
      process, and if "Ignore" is selected in read error prompt,
      only a part of file preceding the unreadable region will be saved
      into archive.

      It can help to avoid interrupting lengthy archiving operations,
      though be aware that files archived with "Ignore" are incomplete.

      If switch -y is specified, "Ignore" is applied to all files by default.

      Previously available "Retry" and "Quit" options are still present
      in read error prompt as well.

   2. Exit code 12 is returned in the command line mode in case of read errors.
      This code is returned for all options in the read error prompt,
      including a newly introduced "Ignore" option.

      Previously more common fatal error code 2 was returned for read errors.

   3. If several archives are selected, "Extract archives to" option group
      in "Options" page of extraction dialog can be used to place extracted
      files to specified destination folder, to separate subfolders
      in destination folder, to separate subfolders in archive folders
      and directly to archive folders.

      It replaces "Extract archives to subfolders" option and available
      only if multiple archives are selected.

   4. New -ad2 switch places extracted files directly to archive's own folder.
      Unlike -ad1, it does not create a separate subfolder for each unpacked
      archive.

   5. "Additional switches" option in "Options" page of archiving
      and extraction dialogs allows to specify WinRAR command line switches.
      It might be useful if there is no option in WinRAR graphical interface
      matching a switch.

      Use this feature only if you are familiar with WinRAR command line
      syntax and clearly understand what specified switches are intended for.

   6. Compression parameters in "Benchmark" command are changed to
      32 MB dictionary and "Normal" method. They match RAR5 default mode
      and more suitable to estimate the typical performance of recent
      WinRAR versions than former 4 MB "Best" intended for RAR4 format.

      Latest "Benchmark" results cannot be compared with previous versions
      directly. New parameters set produces different values, likely lower
      because of eight times larger dictionary size.

   7. When unpacking a part of files from solid volume set,
      WinRAR attempts to skip volumes in the beginning and start
      extraction from volume closest to specified file and with reset
      solid statistics.

      By default WinRAR resets the solid statistics in the beginning
      of large enough solid volumes where possible. For such volumes
      extracting a part of files from the middle of volume set can be
      faster now.

      It does not affect performance when all archived files are unpacked.

   8. Previously WinRAR automatically resorted to extracting from
      first volume, when user started extraction from non-first volume
      and first volume was available. Now WinRAR does so only if all volumes
      between first and specified are also available.

   9. Warning is issued when closing WinRAR if one or more archived files
      had been modified by external apps, but failed to be saved back to
      archive, because an external app still locks them. Such warning
      includes the list of modified files and proposes to quit immediately
      and lose changes or return to WinRAR and close an editor app.

      Previous versions issued a similar warning while editing a file,
      but did not remind it again when quitting.

  10. "Move to Recycle Bin" option in "Delete archive" options group
      of extraction dialog places deleted archives to Recycle Bin
      instead of deleting them permanently.

  11. New "Clear history..." command in "Options" menu allows to remove
      names of recently opened archives in "File" menu and clear drop down
      lists with previously entered values in dialogs. For example,
      these values include archive names in archiving dialog
      and destination paths in extraction dialog.

  12. "File time" options in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog are
      now available for 7z archives. Additionally to modification time,
      WinRAR can set creation and last access time when unpacking such
      archives.

  13. ""New" submenu items" options group is added to
      "Settings/Integration/Context menu items..." dialog. You can use
      these options to remove "WinRAR archive" and "WinRAR ZIP archive"
      entries in "New" submenu of Windows context menu.

      New state of these option is applied only after you press "OK"
      both in "Context menu items" and its parent "Settings" dialog.

  14. <Max>, <Min> and <Hide> commands can be inserted before the program
      name in SFX "Setup" command to run a program in maximized,
      minimized or hidden window. For example:

      Setup=<Hide>setup.exe

  15. It is possible to specify an additional high resolution logo
      for SFX module. If such logo is present, SFX module scales
      and displays it in high DPI Windows mode, providing the better visible
      quality compared to resizing the standard logo.

      Use "High resolution SFX logo" in "Advanced SFX options" dialog
      to define such logo. In command line mode add second -iimg switch
      to set the high resolution logo.

      Recommended size of high resolution logo PNG file is 186x604 pixels.

  16. If archive currently opened in WinRAR shell was deleted or moved
      by another program, WinRAR displays "Inaccessible" before archive name
      in the window title. Also it flashes the window caption and taskbar
      button.

  17. "Total information" option in "Report" dialog is renamed to
      "Headers and totals". Now it also adds headers of report columns
      additionally to total information about listed files and archives.

  18. If archive processing is started from Windows context menu
      in multiple monitor system, WinRAR operation progress and dialogs
      use the monitor with context menu.

      While basic multiple monitor support was present in previous versions
      shell extension for mouse driven commands, now it is extended to
      operations initiated from keyboard and to dropping files to archives.

  19. New -imon<number> switch allows to select a monitor to display
      WinRAR operation progress and dialogs in the command line mode.

      Use -imon1 for primary and -imon2 for secondary monitor.
      For example, "WinRAR x -imon2 arcname" will start extraction
      on secondary monitor.

      It works only in the command line mode and does not affect
      interactive WinRAR graphical inteface also as console RAR.

  20. Switch -idn hides archived names output in archiving, extraction
      and some other commands in console RAR. Other messages and total
      percentage are not affected.

      You can use this switch to reduce visual clutter and console output
      overhead when archiving or extracting a lot of small files.

      Minor visual artifacts, such as percentage indicator overwriting
      few last characters of error messages, are possible with -idn.

  21. Former "-im - show more information" switch is changed to
      "-idv - display verbose output" for consistency with console RAR
      -id[c,d,p,q] message control options and avoid a potential name
      conflict with newer -imon switch.

      While WinRAR still recognizes both -im and -idv, in the future
      -im support can be dropped.

  22. It is allowed to add an optional %arcname% variable to compression
      profile name. Such variable will be replaced with actual archive name.
      It might be convenient when using with "Add to context menu" profile
      option. For example, you can create ZIP compression profile
      and set its name to "Add to %arcname%", to display it with actual
      ZIP archive name in context menu.

  23. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Ins keyboard shortcuts can be used
      in "Diagnostic messages" window to copy contents to clipboard.

  24. More text is allowed in tray icon hint before a lengthy text
      is truncated. Also such text is now truncated in the middle of string,
      so both command type and completion percentage are still visible.

  25. In case of clean install, if previous version compression profiles
      are not present, "Files to store without compression" field
      in newly created predefined compression profiles is set to:

        *.rar *.zip *.cab *.7z *.ace *.arj *.bz2 *.gz *.lha *.lzh
        *.taz *.tgz *.xz *.txz

      You can change this field and save a modified value to compression
      profile later.

      Previous versions set this field to blank for clean install.

  26. Destination path history in extraction dialog treats paths like
      'folder' and 'folder\' as the same path and displays only 'folder'
      entry. Previously they occupied two entries in the history.

  27. "Enable Itanium executable compression" GUI option and -mci command
      line switch are removed. Optimized compression of Itanium executables
      is not supported anymore. WinRAR still can decompress already existing
      archives utilizing Itanium executable compression.

  28. Bugs fixed:

      a) "Lock", "Comment" and "Protect" commands could not be applied
         to several archives selected in WinRAR file list at once;

      b) SFX archive process did not terminate after completing
         extraction in Windows 10 if archive comment included "Setup"
         and "SetupCode" commands, did not include "TempMode" command
         and setup program was running for more than 8 minutes;

      c) compression profiles with quote character in profile name
         could not be invoked from Explorer context menu.

# acefile 0.6 API Documentation[¶](#project-version-api-documentation "Link to this heading")

Read/test/extract ACE 1.0 and 2.0 archives in pure python.

This single-file, pure python 3, no-dependencies implementation is intended
to be used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone unace utility.
As mostly pure-python implementation, it is significantly slower than
native implementations, but more robust against vulnerabilities.

This implementation supports up to version 2.0 of the ACE archive format,
including the EXE, DELTA, PIC and SOUND modes of ACE 2.0, password protected
archives and multi-volume archives. It does not support writing to archives.
It is an implementation from scratch, based on the 1998 document titled
“Technical information of the archiver ACE v1.2” by Marcel Lemke, using
unace 2.5 and WinAce 2.69 by Marcel Lemke as reference implementations.

## API[¶](#api "Link to this heading")

Typical use of [`acefile`](#module-acefile "acefile") has the following structure:

```
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    # operations on AceArchive f
    for member in f:
        # operations on AceArchive f and each AceMember member

```

See [`acefile.AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive") and [`acefile.AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") for the
complete descriptions of the methods supported by these two classes.

### Functions[¶](#functions "Link to this heading")

acefile.is\_acefile(*file*, *\**, *search=524288*)[¶](#acefile.is_acefile "Link to this definition")

Return True iff *file* refers to an ACE archive by filename or seekable
file-like object.
If *search* is 0, the archive must start at position 0 in *file*,
otherwise the first *search* bytes are searched for the magic bytes
`**ACE**` that mark the ACE main header.
For 1:1 compatibility with the official unace, 1024 sectors are
searched by default, even though none of the SFX stubs that come with
ACE compressors are that large.

acefile.open(*file*, *mode='r'*, *\\**, *search=524288*)[¶](#acefile.open "Link to this definition")

Open archive from *file*, which is either a filename or seekable
file-like object, and return an instance of [`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive")
representing the opened archive that can function as a context
manager.
Only *mode* ‘r’ is implemented.
If *search* is 0, the archive must start at position 0 in *file*,
otherwise the first *search* bytes are searched for the magic bytes
`**ACE**` that mark the ACE main header.
For 1:1 compatibility with the official unace, 1024 sectors are
searched by default, even though none of the SFX stubs that come with
ACE compressors are that large.

Multi-volume archives are represented by a single [`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive")
object to the caller, all operations transparently read into subsequent
volumes as required.
To load a multi-volume archive, either open the first volume of the
series by filename, or provide a list or tuple of all file-like
objects or filenames in the correct order in *file*.

### AceArchive Class[¶](#acearchive-class "Link to this heading")

*class* acefile.AceArchive(*file*, *mode='r'*, *\**, *search=524288*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive "Link to this definition")

Represents an ACE archive, possibly consisting of multiple volumes.
[`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive") is not directly instantiated; instead, instances are
returned by [`acefile.open()`](#acefile.open "acefile.open").

When used as a context manager, [`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive") ensures that
[`AceArchive.close()`](#acefile.AceArchive.close "acefile.AceArchive.close") is called after the block.
When used as an iterator, [`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive") yields instances of
[`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") representing all archive members in order of
appearance in the archive.

close()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.close "Link to this definition")

Close the archive and all open files.
No other methods may be called after having called
[`AceArchive.close()`](#acefile.AceArchive.close "acefile.AceArchive.close"), but calling [`AceArchive.close()`](#acefile.AceArchive.close "acefile.AceArchive.close")
multiple times is permitted.

dumpheaders(*file=<\_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.dumpheaders "Link to this definition")

Dump all ACE file format headers in this archive and all its volumes
to *file*.

extract(*member*, *\**, *path=None*, *pwd=None*, *restore=False*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.extract "Link to this definition")

Extract an archive member to *path* or the current working directory.
*Member* can refer to an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object, a member name or
an index into the archive member list.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt the archive member if it is
encrypted.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if an archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.
Iff *restore* is True, restore mtime and atime for non-dir members,
file attributes and NT security information as far as supported by
the platform.

Note

For **solid** archives, extracting members in a different order
than they appear in the archive works, but is potentially very
slow, because the decompressor needs to restart decompression at
the beginning of the solid archive to restore internal decompressor
state.
For **encrypted solid** archives, out of order access may fail when
archive members use different passwords.

extractall(*\**, *path=None*, *members=None*, *pwd=None*, *restore=False*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.extractall "Link to this definition")

Extract *members* or all members from archive to *path* or the current
working directory.
*Members* can contain [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") objects, member names or
indexes into the archive member list.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt encrypted archive members.
To extract archives that use multiple different passwords for different
archive members, you must use [`AceArchive.extract()`](#acefile.AceArchive.extract "acefile.AceArchive.extract") instead.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if an archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.
Iff *restore* is True, restore mtime and atime for non-dir members,
file attributes and NT security information as far as supported by
the platform.

getmember(*member*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.getmember "Link to this definition")

Return an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object corresponding to archive
member *member*.
Raise `KeyError` or `IndexError` if *member* is not
found in archive.
*Member* can refer to an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object, a member name or
an index into the archive member list.
If *member* is a name and it occurs multiple times in the archive,
then the last member with matching filename is returned.

getmembers()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.getmembers "Link to this definition")

Return a list of [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") objects for the members of the
archive.
The objects are in the same order as they are in the archive.
For simply iterating over the members of an archive, it is more concise
and functionally equivalent to directly iterate over the
[`AceArchive`](#acefile.AceArchive "acefile.AceArchive") instance instead of over the list returned by
[`AceArchive.getmembers()`](#acefile.AceArchive.getmembers "acefile.AceArchive.getmembers").

getnames()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.getnames "Link to this definition")

Return a list of the (file)names of all the members in the archive
in the order they are in the archive.

is\_locked()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.is_locked "Link to this definition")

Return True iff archive is locked for further modifications.
Since this implementation does not support writing to archives,
presence or absence of the flag in an archive does not change any
behaviour of [`acefile`](#module-acefile "acefile").

is\_multivolume()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.is_multivolume "Link to this definition")

Return True iff archive is a multi-volume archive as determined
by the archive headers. When opening the last volume of a
multi-volume archive, this returns True even though only a single
volume was loaded.

is\_solid()[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.is_solid "Link to this definition")

Return True iff archive is a solid archive, i.e. iff the archive
members are linked to each other by sharing the same LZ77 dictionary.
Members of solid archives should always be read/tested/extracted in
the order they appear in the archive in order to avoid costly
decompression restarts from the beginning of the archive.

read(*member*, *\**, *pwd=None*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.read "Link to this definition")

Read the decompressed bytes of an archive member.
*Member* can refer to an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object, a member name or
an index into the archive member list.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt the archive member if it is
encrypted.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if the archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.

Note

For **solid** archives, reading members in a different order than
they appear in the archive works, but is potentially very slow,
because the decompressor needs to restart decompression at the
beginning of the solid archive to restore internal decompressor
state.
For **encrypted solid** archives, out of order access may fail when
archive members use different passwords.

Note

Using [`AceArchive.read()`](#acefile.AceArchive.read "acefile.AceArchive.read") for large files is inefficient and
may fail for very large files.
Using [`AceArchive.readblocks()`](#acefile.AceArchive.readblocks "acefile.AceArchive.readblocks") to write the data to disk in
blocks ensures that large files can be handled efficiently.

readblocks(*member*, *\**, *pwd=None*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.readblocks "Link to this definition")

Read the archive member by yielding blocks of decompressed bytes.
*Member* can refer to an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object, a member name or
an index into the archive member list.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt the archive member if it is
encrypted.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if the archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.

Note

For **solid** archives, reading members in a different order than
they appear in the archive works, but is potentially very slow,
because the decompressor needs to restart decompression at the
beginning of the solid archive to restore internal decompressor
state.
For **encrypted solid** archives, out of order access may fail when
archive members use different passwords.

test(*member*, *\**, *pwd=None*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.test "Link to this definition")

Test an archive member. Returns False if any corruption was
found, True if the header and decompression was okay.
*Member* can refer to an [`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") object, a member name or
an index into the archive member list.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt the archive member if it is
encrypted.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if the archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.

Note

For **solid** archives, testing members in a different order than
they appear in the archive works, but is potentially very slow,
because the decompressor needs to restart decompression at the
beginning of the solid archive to restore internal decompressor
state.
For **encrypted solid** archives, out of order access may fail when
archive members use different passwords.

testall(*\**, *pwd=None*)[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.testall "Link to this definition")

Test all the members in the archive. Returns the name of the first
archive member with a failing header or content CRC, or None if all
members were okay.
Password *pwd* is used to decrypt encrypted archive members.
To test archives that use multiple different passwords for different
archive members, use [`AceArchive.test()`](#acefile.AceArchive.test "acefile.AceArchive.test") instead.
Raises [`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") if an archive member is
encrypted but no password was provided.

*property* advert[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.advert "Link to this definition")

ACE archive advert string as `str`.
Unregistered versions of ACE compressors communicate that they are
unregistered by including an advert string of
`*UNREGISTERED VERSION*` in archives they create.

version of the ACE format supported by the ACE compressor which
produced the archive.

*property* datetime[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.datetime "Link to this definition")

Archive timestamp as `datetime.datetime` object.

*property* eversion[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.eversion "Link to this definition")

required to extract, which equals the version of the ACE format this
archive is compliant with.

*property* filename[¶](#acefile.AceArchive.filename "Link to this definition")

*class* acefile.AceMember[¶](#acefile.AceMember "Link to this definition")

Represents a single archive member, potentially spanning multiple
archive volumes.
[`AceMember`](#acefile.AceMember "acefile.AceMember") is not directly instantiated; instead, instances are
returned by [`AceArchive.getmember()`](#acefile.AceArchive.getmember "acefile.AceArchive.getmember") and [`AceArchive.getmembers()`](#acefile.AceArchive.getmembers "acefile.AceArchive.getmembers").

is\_dir()[¶](#acefile.AceMember.is_dir "Link to this definition")

The compression type constant for ACE 2.0 blocked mode.

acefile.QUAL\_NONE[¶](#acefile.QUAL_NONE "Link to this definition")

The compression quality constant for no compression.

acefile.QUAL\_FASTEST[¶](#acefile.QUAL_FASTEST "Link to this definition")

The compression quality constant for fastest compression.

acefile.QUAL\_FAST[¶](#acefile.QUAL_FAST "Link to this definition")

The compression quality constant for fast compression.

### Exceptions[¶](#exceptions "Link to this heading")

*exception* acefile.AceError[¶](#acefile.AceError "Link to this definition")

Base class for all [`acefile`](#module-acefile "acefile") exceptions.

*exception* acefile.CorruptedArchiveError[¶](#acefile.CorruptedArchiveError "Link to this definition")

Bases: [`AceError`](#acefile.AceError "acefile.AceError")

Archive is corrupted. Either a header or data CRC check failed, an invalid
value was read from the archive or the archive is truncated.

*exception* acefile.EncryptedArchiveError[¶](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "Link to this definition")

Bases: [`AceError`](#acefile.AceError "acefile.AceError")

Archive member is encrypted but either no password was provided, or
decompression failed with the given password.
Also raised when processing an encrypted solid archive member out of order,
when any previous archive member uses a different password than the archive
member currently being accessed.

Note

Due to the lack of a password verifier in the ACE file format, there is
no straightforward way to distinguish a wrong password from a corrupted
archive. If the CRC check of an encrypted archive member fails or an
[`CorruptedArchiveError`](#acefile.CorruptedArchiveError "acefile.CorruptedArchiveError") is encountered during decompression, it
is assumed that the password was wrong and as a consequence,
[`EncryptedArchiveError`](#acefile.EncryptedArchiveError "acefile.EncryptedArchiveError") is raised.

*exception* acefile.MainHeaderNotFoundError[¶](#acefile.MainHeaderNotFoundError "Link to this definition")

Bases: [`AceError`](#acefile.AceError "acefile.AceError")

The main ACE header marked by the magic bytes `**ACE**` could not be
found.
Either the *search* argument was to small or the archive is not an ACE
format archive.

*exception* acefile.MultiVolumeArchiveError[¶](#acefile.MultiVolumeArchiveError "Link to this definition")

Bases: [`AceError`](#acefile.AceError "acefile.AceError")

A multi-volume archive was expected but a normal archive was found, or
mismatching volumes were provided, or while reading a member from a
multi-volume archive, the member headers indicate that the member
continues in the next volume, but no next volume was found or provided.

*exception* acefile.UnknownCompressionMethodError[¶](#acefile.UnknownCompressionMethodError "Link to this definition")

Bases: [`AceError`](#acefile.AceError "acefile.AceError")

Data was compressed using an unknown compression method and therefore
cannot be decompressed using this implementation. This should not happen
for ACE 1.0 or ACE 2.0 archives since this implementation implements all
existing compression methods.

## Examples[¶](#examples "Link to this heading")

Extract all files in the archive, with directories, to current working dir:

```
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    f.extractall()

```

Walk all files in the archive and test each one of them:

```
import acefile
with acefile.open('example.ace') as f:
    for member in f:
        if member.is_dir():
            continue
        if f.test(member):
            print("CRC OK:     %s" % member.filename)
        else:
            print("CRC FAIL:   %s" % member.filename)

```

In-memory decompression of a specific archive member:

```
import acefile
import io

filelike = io.BytesIO(b'\x73\x83\x31\x00\x00\x00\x90**ACE**\x14\x14' ...)
with acefile.open(filelike) as f:
    data = f.read('example.txt')

```

Handle archives potentially containing large members in chunks to avoid fully
reading them into memory:

```
import acefile

with acefile.open('large.ace') as fi:
    with open('large.iso', 'wb') as fo:
        for block in fi.readblocks('large.iso'):
            fo.write(block)

```

## ACE File Format[¶](#ace-file-format "Link to this heading")

Due to the lack of documentation on the ACE file format, a high-level overview
over the ACE file format is given here, in the hope that it is useful.

### File Structure[¶](#file-structure "Link to this heading")

ACE archives are a series of headers and optional associated data. The first
header is called `MAIN` header; it contains the magic bytes `**ACE**` at
offset +7 and describes the archive volume. Subsequent headers are either
`FILE` or `RECOVERY` headers. `FILE` headers describe archive members
and precede the compressed data bytes, while `RECOVERY` headers contain error
correction data. Originally, in ACE 1.0, all headers used 32 bit length
fields. With ACE 2.0, alternative 64 bit versions of these headers were
introduced to support files larger than 2 GB.

In multi-volume archives, each volume begins with a `MAIN` header that
carries a volume number. When archive members span multiple volumes, each
segment has it’s own `FILE` header. The first volume has the filename
extension `*.ACE`, subsequent archive volumes use `*.C00` to `*.C99`.

Archives can have a main comment and each archive member can have a file
comment. Additionally, archives can have an advert string, which is used by
unregistered versions of the ACE compressor to signal that the archive was
created using an unregistered version by setting it to `*UNREGISTERED
VERSION*`.

### Integrity Checks[¶](#integrity-checks "Link to this heading")

Each header contains a 16 bit checksum over the header bytes. Each archive
member has a 32 bit checksum over the decompressed bytes. ACE uses a bitwise
inverted version of standard CRC-32 with polynomial `0x04C11DB7` as the
32 bit checksum, and a truncated version of that for the 16 bit checksum.

### Compression Methods[¶](#compression-methods "Link to this heading")

Archive members are compressed using one of the following methods, as indicated
in their `FILE` header:

**stored**

Data is stored as-is without any compression applied.

**LZ77**

ACE 1.0 plain LZ77 compression over a Huffman coded symbol stream, with
configurable dictionary size of 1K..4M literals.

**blocked**

ACE 2.0 blocked mode compresses data in separate blocks, each block using
one of the following submodes with different lossless compression
techniques.

**LZ77**

Plain LZ77 over a Huffman coded symbol stream, with configurable
dictionary size of 1K..4M literals.

**EXE**

LZ77 over Huffman with a preprocessor that converts the relative
target addresses of x86 relative JMP and CALL instructions to absolute
addresses before LZ77 compression in order to achieve a higher LZ77
compression ratio for executables.

**DELTA**

LZ77 over Huffman with a preprocessor that rearranges chunks of data
and calculates differences between byte values, resulting in a higher
LZ77 compression ratio for some inputs.

**SOUND**

Multi-channel audio predictor over Huffman coding, resulting in a
higher compression ratio for uncompressed mono/stereo 8/16 bit sound
data.

**PIC**

Two-dimensional pixel value predictor over Huffman coding, resulting
in a higher compression ratio for uncompressed picture data.

Blocks are of variable length. Mode switch instructions are encoded into
each mode’s Huffman symbol stream as a mode switch symbol followed by the
target mode identifier and parameters.

Solid archives use a single dictionary for the whole archive, while non-solid
archives use a separate dictionary per archive member. The compression quality
parameter ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (best) influences the amount of CPU cycles
the compressor spends to find an optimal compression; it has no influence on
decompression.

Comments are compressed using LZP over a Huffman coded symbol stream. Advert
strings and other header information is uncompressed.

### Encryption[¶](#encryption "Link to this heading")

Optional encryption is applied to the compressed data stream after compression.
The user-supplied password of up to 50 characters is transformed into a 160 bit
Blowfish encryption key using a single application of SHA-1, using non-standard
block padding. Blowfish is applied in CBC mode using a constant zero IV to
each archive member separately (a cryptographical design flaw). Each archive
member can have a different password, but in practice most encrypted archives
use a single password for all members. There is no password verifier in the
file format; the only way to verify a password is to decrypt and decompress the
archive member and check the CRC.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account.

# Quantum Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

Intrusion Prevention Systems detect or prevent attempts to exploit weaknesses in vulnerable systems or applications, protecting you in the race to exploit the latest breaking threat. Check Point IPS protections in our Next Generation Firewall are updated automatically. Whether the vulnerability was released years ago, or a few minutes ago, your organization is protected.

![](/wp-content/uploads/intrusion-prevention-system-ips-floating-hero-icon.png)

![Prevent Icon](/wp-content/uploads/icon-gradient-prevent-232x300px.png)

### Secure

Check Point IPS delivers thousands of signature and behavioral preemptive protections

![Molecular icon](/wp-content/uploads/icon-gradient-molecular-232x300px.png)

### Efficient

Our acceleration technologies let you safely enable IPS. A low false positive rate saves your staff valuable time

![Deploy Icon](/wp-content/uploads/icon-gradient-deploy-232x300px.png)

### Unified

Enable IPS on any Check Point security gateway reducing Total Cost of Ownership

### Product Specifications

![Detection Prevention diagram](/wp-content/uploads/intrusion-prevention-system-ips-carousel1-detection-prevention-diagram.png)
### IPS Detects and Prevents:

* Specific known exploits
* Vulnerabilities, including both known and unknown exploit tools
* Protocol misuse which may indicate potential threats
* Tunneling attempts that may indicate data leakage
* Outbound malware communications

### Timely IPS Updates

**Real-Time Protections:** IPS is constantly updated with new defenses against emerging threats. Many of the IPS protections are pre-emptive, providing defenses before vulnerabilities are discovered or exploits are even created.

**Microsoft Vulnerability Coverage:** Check Point is ranked #1 in Microsoft threat coverage, including preemptive protections against emerging vulnerabilities and exploits.

![Virtual Patching icon](/wp-content/uploads/intrusion-prevention-system-ips-carousel3-virtual-patching-icon.png)
### Virtual Patching

Patching is an incomplete security measure, which can leave your network open for attack. By taking a more comprehensive approach, which combines robust IPS functionality with a concerted patching strategy, network administrators can better equip themselves to handle ‘Patch Tuesdays’ and secure the network between upgrades and patches.

### Efficient and Flexible Deployment

* Predefined recommended profiles allows out-of-the-box use and are tuned to optimize security
* Define signature activation rules that match the security needs of your network assets
* Optional detect-only mode sets all protections to only detect to allow you to evaluate your profile

![Deployment screenshot](/wp-content/uploads/intrusion-prevention-system-ips-carousel4-deployment-screen-capture.png)

![SmartEvent](/wp-content/uploads/smart-1-carousel-e.png)
### 360° Visibility and Reporting

Achieve an unmatched level of visibility to detect and prevent threats. Check Point IPS seamlessly integrates with SmartEvent, enabling SOC (Security Operations Center) staff to respond to the highest priority events first, saving them time.
