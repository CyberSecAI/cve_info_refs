  "CVE-2018-20250": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Path Traversal vulnerability due to improper handling of filenames within ACE archives, specifically in the `unacev2.dll` library.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal vulnerability",
        "Improper input validation of filenames",
        "Failure to sanitize or correctly interpret file paths in ACE archive headers",
	"Use of a vulnerable, outdated library (unacev2.dll)"
      ],
      "Impact": "Allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system by crafting a malicious ACE archive. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Crafted ACE archive file"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious ACE archive. Requires the victim to extract the crafted archive with a vulnerable version of WinRAR."
    },
     {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `unacev2.dll` processes the filename field of ACE archives, specifically when the filename includes path traversal characters and a wildcard. The library incorrectly interprets the filename as an absolute path instead of a relative path within the extraction directory, especially when a backslash is used in conjunction with an asterisk, and allows creation of directories outside of the intended location.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal vulnerability",
         "The `unacev2.dll` does not validate that the filename is within a specific directory, allowing the user to specify a path outside the extraction directory.",
	"The `GetDevicePathLen` function returning a value > 0, which leads to skipping of the intended directory and uses the provided path instead.",
        "The library does not properly sanitize filenames with specific path traversal gadgets. It also incorrectly handles certain special characters, such as converting asterisks to underscores.",
        "The library executes the file creation logic without proper validation of the extracted path from the file header which leads to creation of directories even when extraction is aborted by WinRARâ€™s callback function.",
	"The library does not prevent processing of backslash characters that are interpreted as an absolute path."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary file writes, which can lead to code execution by placing a malicious executable in a startup folder. By crafting a specially designed ACE archive, an attacker can bypass intended extraction folder restrictions, and create files to arbitrary locations. For example, they could write a malicious executable to a startup folder, leading to arbitrary code execution on next user logon.",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "The attack vector involves delivering a crafted ACE archive, that will be parsed using a vulnerable version of `unacev2.dll`, typically within WinRAR."
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create a malformed ACE archive with specific characteristics: the first character of the filename should be a forward or backslash and it should contain an asterisk. The target user must open the crafted ACE archive using a vulnerable version of WinRAR."
    },
    {
       "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how WinRAR (specifically, the `unacev2.dll`) parses ACE archive filenames. When a filename in the ACE archive begins with a backslash and includes an asterisk, WinRAR bypasses path validation and the filename is treated as an absolute path.",
        "Weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability",
	"Inadequate validation of the filename field in ACE archives",
        "Incorrect interpretation of file paths",
	  "Use of an outdated unmaintained component (unacev2.dll) without ASLR or DEP protections."
      ],
        "Impact": "Remote code execution via writing a malicious executable to the startup folder.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Maliciously crafted ACE archive"
        ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires the ability to craft a malformed ACE archive file with a specific format, including a filename starting with a backslash and containing an asterisk. Requires the user to use a vulnerable WinRAR to extract the ACE archive"
