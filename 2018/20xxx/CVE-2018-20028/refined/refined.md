Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Inadequate access control checks within the Contao backend allowed users to view records they were not explicitly authorized to see.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Permissions Enforcement:** The system failed to properly restrict the visibility of records based on user permissions.
- **Filter Menu Bypass:** The filter menu in the site structure allowed users to see all matching pages, even if they lacked explicit permissions to view them.
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate URLs to access parent records that they were not authorized to see, such as articles or news items belonging to other users or archives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could view sensitive information that they should not have access to. This could include page structures, articles, news items, and other content managed within the Contao backend.
- Although the content mentions it's not possible to alter the records, the unauthorized viewing can still lead to exposure of confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Filter Menu Abuse:** Using the filter menu in the site structure to expose unauthorized pages.
- **URL Manipulation:** Directly manipulating URLs to access unauthorized records in parent view.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Backend User:** The attacker must have a valid login to the Contao backend.
- **Basic Backend Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to use the filter menu or manipulate URLs in the backend to trigger the vulnerability.
