Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20433:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML external entities (XXE) during the processing of XML configuration files in the `c3p0` library. Specifically, the `extractXmlConfigFromInputStream` method was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization and disabling of entity expansion when parsing XML, allowing external entities to be resolved and processed by the XML parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read local files on the server where `c3p0` is deployed.
- **Other potential impacts:** The description mentions "resolve information outside of the intended sphere of control" which can potentially allow for more than just file disclosure (depending on the environment).

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious XML configuration file containing external entity definitions.
- When the vulnerable `extractXmlConfigFromInputStream` method processes this malicious XML, it resolves the external entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML config to the application. This could be done through a configuration file, or potentially through an API if the application allows it.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the system to craft an appropriate external entity definition to read specific files.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves disabling `setExpandEntityReferences`, which prevents the XML parser from resolving external entities, effectively mitigating the XXE vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of c3p0 prior to 0.9.5.3 and has been addressed in later releases.
- Patches were pushed to Fedora 29 and 30 to resolve this issue.
- Debian also released a security update to address the vulnerability for Debian 8 "Jessie".
