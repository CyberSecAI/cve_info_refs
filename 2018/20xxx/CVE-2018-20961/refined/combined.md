[slackware-security] Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2019-238-01)

New kernel packages are available for Slackware 14.2 to fix a security issue.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/linux-4.4.190/*:  Upgraded.
  These updates fix various bugs and a minor local denial-of-service security
  issue. They also change this option:
    FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS n -> y
  This is needed by on-access virus scanning software.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.
  For more information, see:
    Fixed in 4.4.190:
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20961>
  (* Security fix *)

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.190-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.190 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.190-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.190 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the GFS2 file system in

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-10905](/security/CVE-2016-10905))

It was discovered that the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate socket options in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18509](/security/CVE-2017-18509))

It was discovered that the USB gadget Midi driver in the Linux kernel

contained a double-free vulnerability when handling certain error

conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-20961](/security/CVE-2018-20961))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

writeback: safer lock nesting
commit 2e898e4c0a3897ccd434adac5abb8330194f527b upstream.
lock\_page\_memcg()/unlock\_page\_memcg() use spin\_lock\_irqsave/restore() if
the page's memcg is undergoing move accounting, which occurs when a
process leaves its memcg for a new one that has
memory.move\_charge\_at\_immigrate set.
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_begin,end() use spin\_lock\_irq/spin\_unlock\_irq() if
the given inode is switching writeback domains. Switches occur when
enough writes are issued from a new domain.
This existing pattern is thus suspicious:
lock\_page\_memcg(page);
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_begin(inode, &locked);
...
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_end(inode, locked);
unlock\_page\_memcg(page);
If both inode switch and process memcg migration are both in-flight then
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_end() will unconditionally enable interrupts while
still holding the lock\_page\_memcg() irq spinlock. This suggests the
possibility of deadlock if an interrupt occurs before unlock\_page\_memcg().
truncate
\_\_cancel\_dirty\_page
lock\_page\_memcg
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_begin
unlocked\_inode\_to\_wb\_end
end\_page\_writeback
test\_clear\_page\_writeback
lock\_page\_memcg
unlock\_page\_memcg
Due to configuration limitations this deadlock is not currently possible
because we don't mix cgroup writeback (a cgroupv2 feature) and
memory.move\_charge\_at\_immigrate (a cgroupv1 feature).
If the kernel is hacked to always claim inode switching and memcg
moving\_account, then this script triggers lockup in less than a minute:
cd /mnt/cgroup/memory
mkdir a b
echo 1 > a/memory.move\_charge\_at\_immigrate
echo 1 > b/memory.move\_charge\_at\_immigrate
(
echo $BASHPID > a/cgroup.procs
while true; do
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/big bs=1M count=256
done
) &
while true; do
sync
done &
sleep 1h &
SLEEP=$!
while true; do
echo $SLEEP > a/cgroup.procs
echo $SLEEP > b/cgroup.procs
done
The deadlock does not seem possible, so it's debatable if there's any
reason to modify the kernel. I suggest we should to prevent future
surprises. And Wang Long said "this deadlock occurs three times in our
environment", so there's more reason to apply this, even to stable.
Stable 4.4 has minor conflicts applying this patch. For a clean 4.4 patch

drm/i915/gvt: init mmio by lri command in vgpu inhibit context
commit cd7e61b93d068a80bfe6cb55bf00f17332d831a1 upstream.
There is one issue relates to Coarse Power Gating(CPG) on KBL NUC in GVT-g,
vgpu can't get the correct default context by updating the registers before
inhibit context submission. It always get back the hardware default value
unless the inhibit context submission happened before the 1st time
forcewake put. With this wrong default context, vgpu will run with
incorrect state and meet unknown issues.
The solution is initialize these mmios by adding lri command in ring buffer
of the inhibit context, then gpu hardware has no chance to go down RC6 when
lri commands are right being executed, and then vgpu can get correct
default context for further use.
v3:
- fix code fault, use 'for' to loop through mmio render list(Zhenyu)
v4:
- save the count of engine mmio need to be restored for inhibit context and
refine some comments. (Kevin)
v5:
- code rebase

mm/filemap.c: fix NULL pointer in page\_cache\_tree\_insert()
commit abc1be13fd113ddef5e2d807a466286b864caed3 upstream.
f2fs specifies the \_\_GFP\_ZERO flag for allocating some of its pages.
Unfortunately, the page cache also uses the mapping's GFP flags for
allocating radix tree nodes. It always masked off the \_\_GFP\_HIGHMEM
flag, and masks off \_\_GFP\_ZERO in some paths, but not all. That causes
radix tree nodes to be allocated with a NULL list\_head, which causes
backtraces like:
\_\_list\_del\_entry+0x30/0xd0
list\_lru\_del+0xac/0x1ac
page\_cache\_tree\_insert+0xd8/0x110
The \_\_GFP\_DMA and \_\_GFP\_DMA32 flags would also be able to sneak through
if they are ever used. Fix them all by using GFP\_RECLAIM\_MASK at the
innermost location, and remove it from earlier in the callchain.

autofs: mount point create should honour passed in mode
commit 1e6306652ba18723015d1b4967fe9de55f042499 upstream.
The autofs file system mkdir inode operation blindly sets the created
directory mode to S\_IFDIR | 0555, ingoring the passed in mode, which can
cause selinux dac\_override denials.
But the function also checks if the caller is the daemon (as no-one else
should be able to do anything here) so there's no point in not honouring
the passed in mode, allowing the daemon to set appropriate mode when
required.

device-dax: allow MAP\_SYNC to succeed
commit ef8423022324cf79bd1b41d8707c766461e7e555 upstream.
MAP\_SYNC is a nop for device-dax. Allow MAP\_SYNC to succeed on device-dax
to eliminate special casing between device-dax and fs-dax as to when the
flag can be specified. Device-dax users already implicitly assume that they do
not need to call fsync(), and this enables them to explicitly check for this
capability.

libnvdimm, dimm: handle EACCES failures from label reads
commit e7c5a571a8d6a266aee9ca3f3f26e5afe3717eca upstream.
The new support for the standard \_LSR and \_LSW methods neglected to also
update the nvdimm\_init\_config\_data() and nvdimm\_set\_config\_data() to
return the translated error code from failed commands. This precision is
necessary because the locked status that was previously returned on
ND\_CMD\_GET\_CONFIG\_SIZE commands is now returned on
ND\_CMD\_{GET,SET}\_CONFIG\_DATA commands.
If the kernel misses this indication it can inadvertently fall back to
label-less mode when it should otherwise avoid all access to locked
regions.

drm/i915: Correctly handle limited range YCbCr data on VLV/CHV
commit 5deae9191130db6b617c94fb261804597cf9b508 upstream.
Turns out the VLV/CHV fixed function sprite CSC expects full range
data as input. We've been feeding it limited range data to it all
along. To expand the data out to full range we'll use the color
correction registers (brightness, contrast, and saturation).
On CHV pipe B we were actually doing the right thing already because we
progammed the custom CSC matrix to do expect limited range input. Now
that well pre-expand the data out with the color correction unit, we
need to change the CSC matrix to operate with full range input instead.
This should make the sprite output of the other pipes match the sprite
output of pipe B reasonably well. Looking at the resulting pipe CRCs,
there can be a slight difference in the output, but as I don't know
the formula used by the fixed function CSC of the other pipes, I don't
think it's worth the effort to try to match the output exactly. It
might not even be possible due to difference in internal precision etc.
One slight caveat here is that the color correction registers are single
bufferred, so we should really be updating them during vblank, but we
still don't have a mechanism for that, so just toss in another FIXME.

drm/i915: Fix hibernation with ACPI S0 target state

drm/i915/gen9+: Set same power state before hibernation image
save/restore
during hibernation/suspend the power domain functionality got disabled,
after which resume could leave it incorrectly disabled if the ACPI
target state was S0 during suspend and i915 was not loaded by the loader
kernel.
This was caused by not considering if we resumed from hibernation as the
condition for power domains reiniting.
Fix this by simply tracking if we suspended power domains during system
suspend and reinit power domains accordingly during resume. This will
result in reiniting power domains always when resuming from hibernation,
regardless of the platform and whether or not i915 is loaded by the
loader kernel.
The reason we didn't catch this earlier is that the enabled/disabled
state of power domains during PMSG\_FREEZE/PMSG\_QUIESCE is platform
and kernel config dependent: on my SKL the target state is S4
during PMSG\_FREEZE and (with the driver loaded in the loader kernel)
S0 during PMSG\_QUIESCE. On the reporter's machine it's S0 during
PMSG\_FREEZE but (contrary to this) power domains are not initialized
during PMSG\_QUIESCE since i915 is not loaded in the loader kernel, or
it's loaded but without the DMC firmware being available.

mmc: sdhci-pci: Only do AMD tuning for HS200
commit 300ad8992913025b4294d4fc37b6bfff4a8b7ad1 upstream.
Commit c31165d7400b ("mmc: sdhci-pci: Add support for HS200 tuning mode
on AMD, eMMC-4.5.1") added a HS200 tuning method for use with AMD SDHCI
controllers. As described in the commit subject, this tuning is specific
for HS200. However, as implemented, this method is used for all host
timings, because platform\_execute\_tuning, if it exists, is called
unconditionally by sdhci\_execute\_tuning(). This breaks tuning when using
the AMD controller with, for example, a DDR50 SD card.
Instead, we can implement an amd execute\_tuning wrapper callback, and
then conditionally do the HS200 specific tuning for HS200, and otherwise
call back to the standard sdhci\_execute\_tuning().

fanotify: fix logic of events on child
commit 54a307ba8d3cd00a3902337ffaae28f436eeb1a4 upstream.
When event on child inodes are sent to the parent inode mark and
parent inode mark was not marked with FAN\_EVENT\_ON\_CHILD, the event
will not be delivered to the listener process. However, if the same
process also has a mount mark, the event to the parent inode will be
delivered regadless of the mount mark mask.
This behavior is incorrect in the case where the mount mark mask does
not contain the specific event type. For example, the process adds
a mark on a directory with mask FAN\_MODIFY (without FAN\_EVENT\_ON\_CHILD)
and a mount mark with mask FAN\_CLOSE\_NOWRITE (without FAN\_ONDIR).
A modify event on a file inside that directory (and inside that mount)
should not create a FAN\_MODIFY event, because neither of the marks
requested to get that event on the file.

udf: Fix leak of UTF-16 surrogates into encoded strings
commit 44f06ba8297c7e9dfd0e49b40cbe119113cca094 upstream.
OSTA UDF specification does not mention whether the CS0 charset in case
of two bytes per character encoding should be treated in UTF-16 or
UCS-2. The sample code in the standard does not treat UTF-16 surrogates
in any special way but on systems such as Windows which work in UTF-16
internally, filenames would be treated as being in UTF-16 effectively.
In Linux it is more difficult to handle characters outside of Base
Multilingual plane (beyond 0xffff) as NLS framework works with 2-byte
characters only. Just make sure we don't leak UTF-16 surrogates into the
resulting string when loading names from the filesystem for now.

powerpc/lib: Fix off-by-one in alternate feature patching
commit b8858581febb050688e276b956796bc4a78299ed upstream.
When we patch an alternate feature section, we have to adjust any
relative branches that branch out of the alternate section.
But currently we have a bug if we have a branch that points to past
the last instruction of the alternate section, eg:
FTR\_SECTION\_ELSE
1: b 2f
or 6,6,6
2:
ALT\_FTR\_SECTION\_END(...)
nop
This will result in a relative branch at 1 with a target that equals
the end of the alternate section.
That branch does not need adjusting when it's moved to the non-else
location. Currently we do adjust it, resulting in a branch that goes
off into the link-time location of the else section, which is junk.
The fix is to not patch branches that have a target == end of the
alternate section.

powerpc/xive: Fix trying to "push" an already active pool VP
commit b32e56e5a87a1f9243db92bc7a5df0ffb4627cfb upstream.
When setting up a CPU, we "push" (activate) a pool VP for it.
However it's an error to do so if it already has an active
pool VP.
This happens when doing soft CPU hotplug on powernv since we
don't tear down the CPU on unplug. The HW flags the error which
gets captured by the diagnostics.
Fix this by making sure to "pull" out any already active pool
first.

powerpc/eeh: Fix enabling bridge MMIO windows
commit 13a83eac373c49c0a081cbcd137e79210fe78acd upstream.
On boot we save the configuration space of PCIe bridges. We do this so
when we get an EEH event and everything gets reset that we can restore
them.
Unfortunately we save this state before we've enabled the MMIO space
on the bridges. Hence if we have to reset the bridge when we come back
MMIO is not enabled and we end up taking an PE freeze when the driver
starts accessing again.
This patch forces the memory/MMIO and bus mastering on when restoring
bridges on EEH. Ideally we'd do this correctly by saving the
configuration space writes later, but that will have to come later in
a larger EEH rewrite. For now we have this simple fix.
The original bug can be triggered on a boston machine by doing:
echo 0x8000000000000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/PCI0001/err\_injct\_outbound
On boston, this PHB has a PCIe switch on it. Without this patch,
you'll see two EEH events, 1 expected and 1 the failure we are fixing
here. The second EEH event causes the anything under the PHB to
disappear (i.e. the i40e eth).
With this patch, only 1 EEH event occurs and devices properly recover.

MIPS: memset.S: Fix clobber of v1 in last\_fixup
commit c96eebf07692e53bf4dd5987510d8b550e793598 upstream.
The label .Llast\_fixup\@ is jumped to on page fault within the final
byte set loop of memset (on < MIPSR6 architectures). For some reason, in
this fault handler, the v1 register is randomly set to a2 & STORMASK.
This clobbers v1 for the calling function. This can be observed with the
following test code:
static int \_\_init \_\_attribute\_\_((optimize("O0"))) test\_clear\_user(void)
{
register int t asm("v1");
char \*test;
int j, k;
pr\_info("\n\n\nTesting clear\_user\n");
test = vmalloc(PAGE\_SIZE);
for (j = 256; j < 512; j++) {
t = 0xa5a5a5a5;
if ((k = clear\_user(test + PAGE\_SIZE - 256, j)) != j - 256) {
pr\_err("clear\_user (%px %d) returned %d\n", test + PAGE\_SIZE - 256, j, k);
}
if (t != 0xa5a5a5a5) {
pr\_err("v1 was clobbered to 0x%x!\n", t);
}
}
return 0;
}
late\_initcall(test\_clear\_user);
Which demonstrates that v1 is indeed clobbered (MIPS64):
Testing clear\_user
v1 was clobbered to 0x1!
v1 was clobbered to 0x2!
v1 was clobbered to 0x3!
v1 was clobbered to 0x4!
v1 was clobbered to 0x5!
v1 was clobbered to 0x6!
v1 was clobbered to 0x7!
Since the number of bytes that could not be set is already contained in
a2, the andi placing a value in v1 is not necessary and actively
harmful in clobbering v1.

MIPS: memset.S: Fix return of \_\_clear\_user from Lpartial\_fixup
commit daf70d89f80c6e1772233da9e020114b1254e7e0 upstream.
The \_\_clear\_user function is defined to return the number of bytes that
could not be cleared. From the underlying memset / bzero implementation
this means setting register a2 to that number on return. Currently if a
page fault is triggered within the memset\_partial block, the value
loaded into a2 on return is meaningless.
The label .Lpartial\_fixup\@ is jumped to on page fault. In order to work
out how many bytes failed to copy, the exception handler should find how
many bytes left in the partial block (andi a2, STORMASK), add that to
the partial block end address (a2), and subtract the faulting address to
get the remainder. Currently it incorrectly subtracts the partial block
start address (t1), which has additionally been clobbered to generate a
jump target in memset\_partial. Fix this by adding the block end address
instead.
This issue was found with the following test code:
int j, k;
for (j = 0; j < 512; j++) {
if ((k = clear\_user(NULL, j)) != j) {
pr\_err("clear\_user (NULL %d) returned %d\n", j, k);
}
}
Which now passes on Creator Ci40 (MIPS32) and Cavium Octeon II (MIPS64).

MIPS: memset.S: EVA & fault support for small\_memset
commit 8a8158c85e1e774a44fbe81106fa41138580dfd1 upstream.
The MIPS kernel memset / bzero implementation includes a small\_memset
branch which is used when the region to be set is smaller than a long (4
bytes on 32bit, 8 bytes on 64bit). The current small\_memset
implementation uses a simple store byte loop to write the destination.
There are 2 issues with this implementation:
1. When EVA mode is active, user and kernel address spaces may overlap.
Currently the use of the sb instruction means kernel mode addressing is
always used and an intended write to userspace may actually overwrite
some critical kernel data.
2. If the write triggers a page fault, for example by calling
\_\_clear\_user(NULL, 2), instead of gracefully handling the fault, an OOPS
is triggered.
Fix these issues by replacing the sb instruction with the EX() macro,
which will emit EVA compatible instuctions as required. Additionally
implement a fault fixup for small\_memset which sets a2 to the number of
bytes that could not be cleared (as defined by \_\_clear\_user).

HID: input: fix battery level reporting on BT mice
commit 2e210bbb7429cdcf1a1a3ad00c1bf98bd9bf2452 upstream.
The commit 581c4484769e ("HID: input: map digitizer battery usage")
assumed that devices having input (qas opposed to feature) report for
battery strength would report the data on their own, without the need to
be polled by the kernel; unfortunately it is not so. Many wireless mice
do not send unsolicited reports with battery strength data and have to
be polled explicitly. As a complication, stylus devices on digitizers
are not normally connected to the base and thus can not be polled - the
base can only determine battery strength in the stylus when it is in
proximity.
To solve this issue, we add a special flag that tells the kernel
to avoid polling the device (and expect unsolicited reports) and set it
when report field with physical usage of digitizer stylus (HID\_DG\_STYLUS).
Unless this flag is set, and we have not seen the unsolicited reports,
the kernel will attempt to poll the device when userspace attempts to
read "capacity" and "state" attributes of power\_supply object
corresponding to the devices battery.

random: use a different mixing algorithm for add\_device\_randomness()
commit dc12baacb95f205948f64dc936a47d89ee110117 upstream.
add\_device\_randomness() use of crng\_fast\_load() was highly
problematic. Some callers of add\_device\_randomness() can pass in a
large amount of static information. This would immediately promote
the crng\_init state from 0 to 1, without really doing much to
initialize the primary\_crng's internal state with something even
vaguely unpredictable.
Since we don't have the speed constraints of add\_interrupt\_randomness(),
we can do a better job mixing in the what unpredictability a device
driver or architecture maintainer might see fit to give us, and do it
in a way which does not bump the crng\_init\_cnt variable.
Also, since add\_device\_randomness() doesn't bump any entropy
accounting in crng\_init state 0, mix the device randomness into the
input\_pool entropy pool as well. This is related to CVE-2018-1108.

ALSA: hda/realtek - set PINCFG\_HEADSET\_MIC to parse\_flags
commit 3ce0d5aa265bcc0a4b281cb0cabf92491276101b upstream.
Otherwise, the pin will be regarded as microphone, and the jack name
is "Mic Phantom", it is always on in the pulseaudio even nothing is
plugged into the jack. So the UI is confusing to users since the
microphone always shows up in the UI even there is no microphone
plugged.
After adding this flag, the jack name is "Headset Mic Phantom", then
the pulseaudio can handle its detection correctly.

Some rawmidi compat ioctls lack of the input substream checks
(although they do check only for rfile->output). This many eventually
lead to an Oops as NULL substream is passed to the rawmidi core
functions.
Fix it by adding the proper checks before each function call.

ALSA: line6: Use correct endpoint type for midi output
commit 7ecb46e9ee9af18e304eb9e7d6804c59a408e846 upstream.
Sending MIDI messages to a PODxt through the USB connection shows
"usb\_submit\_urb failed" in dmesg and the message is not received by
the POD.
The error is caused because in the funcion send\_midi\_async() in midi.c
there is a call to usb\_sndbulkpipe() for endpoint 3 OUT, but the PODxt
USB descriptor shows that this endpoint it's an interrupt endpoint.
Patch tested with PODxt only.

drm/radeon: Fix PCIe lane width calculation
commit 85e290d92b4b794d0c758c53007eb4248d385386 upstream.
Two years ago I tried an AMD Radeon E8860 embedded GPU with the drm driver.
The dmesg output included driver warnings about an invalid PCIe lane width.
Tracking the problem back led to si\_set\_pcie\_lane\_width\_in\_smc().
The calculation of the lane widths via ATOM\_PPLIB\_PCIE\_LINK\_WIDTH\_MASK and
ATOM\_PPLIB\_PCIE\_LINK\_WIDTH\_SHIFT macros did not increment the resulting
value, per the comment in pptable.h ("lanes - 1"), and per usage elsewhere.
Applying the increment silenced the warnings.
The code has not changed since, so either my analysis was incorrect or the
bug has gone unnoticed. Hence submitting this as an RFC.

drm/rockchip: Clear all interrupts before requesting the IRQ
commit 5f9e93fed4d45e9a8f84728aff1a8f2ab8922902 upstream.
Calling request\_irq() followed by disable\_irq() is usually a bad idea,
specially if the interrupt can be pending, and you're not yet in a
position to handle it.
This is exactly what happens on my kevin system when rebooting in a
second kernel using kexec: Some interrupt is left pending from
the previous kernel, and we take it too early, before disable\_irq()
could do anything.
Let's clear the pending interrupts as we initialize the HW, and move
the interrupt request after that point. This ensures that we're in
a sane state when the interrupt is requested.

When device boots with T > T\_trip\_1 and requests interrupt,
the race condition takes place. The interrupt comes before
THERMAL\_DEVICE\_ENABLED is set. This leads to an attempt to
reading sensor value from irq and disabling the sensor, based on
the data->mode field, which expected to be THERMAL\_DEVICE\_ENABLED,
but still stays as THERMAL\_DEVICE\_DISABLED. Afher this issue
sensor is never re-enabled, as the driver state is wrong.
Fix this problem by setting the 'data' members prior to
requesting the interrupts.

# cd /sys/class/pwm//
# echo 0 > export
# cd pwm0
# echo 30 > period
# echo 30 > duty\_cycle
# echo 0 > duty\_cycle
# cat duty\_cycle

--> Then, the actual duty\_cycle is 30, not 0.
So, this patch adds a condition into rcar\_pwm\_config() to fix this

clk: fix false-positive Wmaybe-uninitialized warning
commit ce33f284935e08229046b30635e6aadcbab02b53 upstream.
When we build this driver with on x86-32, gcc produces a false-positive warning:
drivers/clk/renesas/clk-sh73a0.c: In function 'sh73a0\_cpg\_clocks\_init':
drivers/clk/renesas/clk-sh73a0.c:155:10: error: 'parent\_name' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]
return clk\_register\_fixed\_factor(NULL, name, parent\_name, 0,
We can work around that warning by adding a fake initialization, I tried
and failed to come up with any better workaround. This is currently one
of few remaining warnings for a 4.14.y randconfig build, so it would be
good to also have it backported at least to that version. Older versions
have more randconfig warnings, so we might not care.
I had not noticed this earlier, because one patch in my randconfig test
tree removes the '-ffreestanding' option on x86-32, and that avoids
the warning. The -ffreestanding flag was originally global but moved
into arch/i386 by Andi Kleen in commit 6edfba1b33c7 ("[PATCH] x86\_64:
Don't define string functions to builtin") as a 'temporary workaround'.
Like many temporary hacks, this turned out to be rather long-lived, from
all I can tell we still need a simple fix to asm/string\_32.h before it
can be removed, but I'm not sure about how to best do that.

clk: mvebu: armada-38x: add support for missing clocks
commit 6a4a4595804548e173f0763a0e7274a3521c59a9 upstream.
Clearfog boards can come with a CPU clocked at 1600MHz (commercial)
or 1333MHz (industrial).
They have also some dip-switches to select a different clock (666, 800,
1066, 1200).
The funny thing is that the recovery button is on the MPP34 fq selector.
So, when booting an industrial board with this button down, the frequency
666MHz is selected (and the kernel didn't boot).
This patch add all the missing clocks.
The only mode I didn't test is 2GHz (uboot found 4294MHz instead :/ ).

PCI: Mark Broadcom HT1100 and HT2000 Root Port Extended Tags as broken
commit 1b30dfd376e28e7f37eda5e2033f6823cdda222b upstream.
Per PCIe r3.1, sec 2.2.6.2 and 7.8.4, a Requester may not use 8-bit Tags
unless its Extended Tag Field Enable is set, but all Receivers/Completers
must handle 8-bit Tags correctly regardless of their Extended Tag Field
Enable.
Some devices do not handle 8-bit Tags as Completers, so add a quirk for
them. If we find such a device, we disable Extended Tags for the entire
hierarchy to make peer-to-peer DMA possible.
The Broadcom HT1100/HT2000/HT2100 seems to have issues with handling 8-bit
tags. Mark it as broken.
This fixes Xorg hangs and unresponsive keyboards with errors like this:

mmc: jz4740: Fix race condition in IRQ mask update
commit a04f0017c22453613d5f423326b190c61e3b4f98 upstream.
A spinlock is held while updating the internal copy of the IRQ mask,
but not while writing it to the actual IMASK register. After the lock
is released, an IRQ can occur before the IMASK register is written.
If handling this IRQ causes the mask to be changed, when the handler
returns back to the middle of the first mask update, a stale value
will be written to the mask register.
If this causes an IRQ to become unmasked that cannot have its status
cleared by writing a 1 to it in the IREG register, e.g. the SDIO IRQ,
then we can end up stuck with the same IRQ repeatedly being fired but
not handled. Normally the MMC IRQ handler attempts to clear any
unexpected IRQs by writing IREG, but for those that cannot be cleared
in this way then the IRQ will just repeatedly fire.
This was resulting in lockups after a while of using Wi-Fi on the
CI20 (GitHub issue #19).
Resolve by holding the spinlock until after the IMASK register has
been updated.

ring-buffer: Check if memory is available before allocation
commit 2a872fa4e9c8adc79c830e4009e1cc0c013a9d8a upstream.
The ring buffer is made up of a link list of pages. When making the ring
buffer bigger, it will allocate all the pages it needs before adding to the
ring buffer, and if it fails, it frees them and returns an error. This makes
increasing the ring buffer size an all or nothing action. When this was
first created, the pages were allocated with "NORETRY". This was to not
cause any Out-Of-Memory (OOM) actions from allocating the ring buffer. But
NORETRY was too strict, as the ring buffer would fail to expand even when
there's memory available, but was taken up in the page cache.
Commit 848618857d253 ("tracing/ring\_buffer: Try harder to allocate") changed
the allocating from NORETRY to RETRY\_MAYFAIL. The RETRY\_MAYFAIL would
allocate from the page cache, but if there was no memory available, it would
simple fail the allocation and not trigger an OOM.
This worked fine, but had one problem. As the ring buffer would allocate one
page at a time, it could take up all memory in the system before it failed
to allocate and free that memory. If the allocation is happening and the
ring buffer allocates all memory and then tries to take more than available,
its allocation will not trigger an OOM, but if there's any allocation that
happens someplace else, that could trigger an OOM, even though once the ring
buffer's allocation fails, it would free up all the previous memory it tried
to allocate, and allow other memory allocations to succeed.
Commit d02bd27bd33dd ("mm/page\_alloc.c: calculate 'available' memory in a
separate function") separated out si\_mem\_availble() as a separate function
that could be used to see how much memory is available in the system. Using
this function to make sure that the ring buffer could be allocated before it
tries to allocate pages we can avoid allocating all memory in the system and
making it vulnerable to OOMs if other allocations are taking place.

libnvdimm, dimm: fix dpa reservation vs uninitialized label area
commit c31898c8c711f2bbbcaebe802a55827e288d875a upstream.

device's label area and reserves address space for each of the
namespaces defined.
However, as can be seen below, the reservation occurs even when the
index blocks are invalid:

nvdimm nmem0: config data size: 131072
nvdimm nmem0: \_\_nd\_label\_validate: nsindex0 labelsize 1 invalid

tpm: self test failure should not cause suspend to fail
commit 0803d7befa15cab5717d667a97a66214d2a4c083 upstream.
The Acer Acer Veriton X4110G has a TPM device detected as:
tpm\_tis 00:0b: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0xFE, rev-id 71)
After the first S3 suspend, the following error appears during resume:
tpm tpm0: A TPM error(38) occurred continue selftest
Any following S3 suspend attempts will now fail with this error:
tpm tpm0: Error (38) sending savestate before suspend
PM: Device 00:0b failed to suspend: error 38
Error 38 is TPM\_ERR\_INVALID\_POSTINIT which means the TPM is
not in the correct state. This indicates that the platform BIOS
is not sending the usual TPM\_Startup command during S3 resume.
>From this point onwards, all TPM commands will fail.
The same issue was previously reported on Foxconn 6150BK8MC and
Sony Vaio TX3.
The platform behaviour seems broken here, but we should not break
suspend/resume because of this.
When the unexpected TPM state is encountered, set a flag to skip the
affected TPM\_SaveState command on later suspends.

cxl: Fix possible deadlock when processing page faults from cxllib
commit ad7b4e8022b9864c075fe71e1328b1d25cad82f6 upstream.
cxllib\_handle\_fault() is called by an external driver when it needs to
have the host resolve page faults for a buffer. The buffer can cover
several pages and VMAs. The function iterates over all the pages used
by the buffer, based on the page size of the VMA.
To ensure some stability while processing the faults, the thread T1
grabs the mm->mmap\_sem semaphore with read access (R1). However, when
processing a page fault for a single page, one of the underlying
functions, copro\_handle\_mm\_fault(), also grabs the same semaphore with
read access (R2). So the thread T1 takes the semaphore twice.
If another thread T2 tries to access the semaphore in write mode W1
(say, because it wants to allocate memory and calls 'brk'), then that
thread T2 will have to wait because there's a reader (R1). If the
thread T1 is processing a new page at that time, it won't get an
automatic grant at R2, because there's now a writer thread
waiting (T2). And we have a deadlock.
The timeline is:
1. thread T1 owns the semaphore with read access R1
2. thread T2 requests write access W1 and waits
3. thread T1 requests read access R2 and waits
The fix is for the thread T1 to release the semaphore R1 once it got
the information it needs from the current VMA. The address space/VMAs
could evolve while T1 iterates over the full buffer, but in the
unlikely case where T1 misses a page, the external driver will raise a
new page fault when retrying the memory access.

dmaengine: at\_xdmac: fix rare residue corruption
commit c5637476bbf9bb86c7f0413b8f4822a73d8d2d07 upstream.
Despite the efforts made to correctly read the NDA and CUBC registers,
the order in which the registers are read could sometimes lead to an
inconsistent state.
Re-using the timeline from the comments, this following timing of
registers reads could lead to reading NDA with value "@desc2" and
CUBC with value "MAX desc1":
INITD -------- ------------
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
NDA @desc2 \/ @desc3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_/\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
CUBC 0 \/ MAX desc1 \/ MAX desc2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_/\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_/\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| | | |
Events:(1)(2) (3)(4)
(1) check\_nda = @desc2
(2) initd = 1
(3) cur\_ubc = MAX desc1
(4) cur\_nda = @desc2
This is allowed by the condition ((check\_nda == cur\_nda) && initd),
despite cur\_ubc and cur\_nda being in the precise state we don't want.
This error leads to incorrect residue computation.
Fix it by inversing the order in which CUBC and INITD are read. This
makes sure that NDA and CUBC are always read together either \_before\_
INITD goes to 0 or \_after\_ it is back at 1.
The case where NDA is read before INITD is at 0 and CUBC is read after
INITD is back at 1 will be rejected by check\_nda and cur\_nda being
different.

IB/srpt: Fix an out-of-bounds stack access in srpt\_zerolength\_write()
commit 2a78cb4db487372152bed2055c038f9634d595e8 upstream.
Avoid triggering an out-of-bounds stack access by changing the type
of 'wr' from ib\_send\_wr into ib\_rdma\_wr.
This patch fixes the following KASAN bug report:

IB/srp: Fix completion vector assignment algorithm
commit 3a148896b24adf8688dc0c59af54531931677a40 upstream.
Ensure that cv\_end is equal to ibdev->num\_comp\_vectors for the
NUMA node with the highest index. This patch improves spreading
of RDMA channels over completion vectors and thereby improves
performance, especially on systems with only a single NUMA node.
This patch drops support for the comp\_vector login parameter by
ignoring the value of that parameter since I have not found a
good way to combine support for that parameter and automatic
spreading of RDMA channels over completion vectors.

Before commit e494f6a72839 ("[SCSI] improved eh timeout handler") it
did not really matter whether or not abort handlers like srp\_abort()
called .scsi\_done() when returning another value than SUCCESS. Since
that commit however this matters. Hence only call .scsi\_done() when
returning SUCCESS.

ALSA: pcm: Fix endless loop for XRUN recovery in OSS emulation
commit e15dc99dbb9cf99f6432e8e3c0b3a8f7a3403a86 upstream.
The commit 02a5d6925cd3 ("ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS
ioctls and read/write") split the PCM preparation code to a locked
version, and it added a sanity check of runtime->oss.prepare flag
along with the change. This leaded to an endless loop when the stream
gets XRUN: namely, snd\_pcm\_oss\_write3() and co call
snd\_pcm\_oss\_prepare() without setting runtime->oss.prepare flag and
the loop continues until the PCM state reaches to another one.
As the function is supposed to execute the preparation
unconditionally, drop the invalid state check there.
The bug was triggered by syzkaller.

ALSA: pcm: Fix UAF at PCM release via PCM timer access
commit a820ccbe21e8ce8e86c39cd1d3bc8c7d1cbb949b upstream.
The PCM runtime object is created and freed dynamically at PCM stream
open / close time. This is tracked via substream->runtime, and it's
cleared at snd\_pcm\_detach\_substream().
The runtime object assignment is protected by PCM open\_mutex, so for
all PCM operations, it's safely handled. However, each PCM substream
provides also an ALSA timer interface, and user-space can access to
this while closing a PCM substream. This may eventually lead to a
UAF, as snd\_pcm\_timer\_resolution() tries to access the runtime while
clearing it in other side.
Fortunately, it's the only concurrent access from the PCM timer, and
it merely reads runtime->timer\_resolution field. So, we can avoid the
race by reordering kfree() and wrapping the substream->runtime
clearance with the corresponding timer lock.

The previous fix 40cab6e88cb0 ("ALSA: pcm: Return -EBUSY for OSS

check of runtime->oss.rw\_ref was inserted in a wrong place after the
mutex lock.

ALSA: pcm: Return -EBUSY for OSS ioctls changing busy streams
commit 40cab6e88cb0b6c56d3f30b7491a20e803f948f6 upstream.
OSS PCM stream management isn't modal but it allows ioctls issued at
any time for changing the parameters. In the previous hardening
patch ("ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS ioctls and
read/write"), we covered these races and prevent the corruption by
protecting the concurrent accesses via params\_lock mutex. However,
this means that some ioctls that try to change the stream parameter
(e.g. channels or format) would be blocked until the read/write
finishes, and it may take really long.
Basically changing the parameter while reading/writing is an invalid
operation, hence it's even more user-friendly from the API POV if it
returns -EBUSY in such a situation.
This patch adds such checks in the relevant ioctls with the addition
of read/write access refcount.

ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS ioctls and read/write
commit 02a5d6925cd34c3b774bdb8eefb057c40a30e870 upstream.
Although we apply the params\_lock mutex to the whole read and write
operations as well as snd\_pcm\_oss\_change\_params(), we may still face
some races.
First off, the params\_lock is taken inside the read and write loop.
This is intentional for avoiding the too long locking, but it allows
the in-between parameter change, which might lead to invalid
pointers. We check the readiness of the stream and set up via
snd\_pcm\_oss\_make\_ready() at the beginning of read and write, but it's
called only once, by assuming that it remains ready in the rest.
Second, many ioctls that may change the actual parameters
(i.e. setting runtime->oss.params=1) aren't protected, hence they can
be processed in a half-baked state.
This patch is an attempt to plug these holes. The stream readiness
check is moved inside the read/write inner loop, so that the stream is
always set up in a proper state before further processing. Also, each
ioctl that may change the parameter is wrapped with the params\_lock
for avoiding the races.
The issues were triggered by syzkaller in a few different scenarios,
particularly the one below appearing as GPF in loopback\_pos\_update.

xprtrdma: Fix corner cases when handling device removal
commit 25524288631fc5b7d33259fca1e0dc38146be5d6 upstream.
Michal Kalderon has found some corner cases around device unload
with active NFS mounts that I didn't have the imagination to test
when xprtrdma device removal was added last year.
- The ULP device removal handler is responsible for deallocating
the PD. That wasn't clear to me initially, and my own testing
suggested it was not necessary, but that is incorrect.
- The transport destruction path can no longer assume that there
is a valid ID.
- When destroying a transport, ensure that ib\_free\_cq() is not
invoked on a CQ that was already released.

xprtrdma: Fix latency regression on NUMA NFS/RDMA clients
commit 6720a89933739cb8dec748cd253f7c8df2c0ae4d upstream.
With v4.15, on one of my NFS/RDMA clients I measured a nearly
doubling in the latency of small read and write system calls. There
was no change in server round trip time. The extra latency appears
in the whole RPC execution path.
"git bisect" settled on commit ccede7598588 ("xprtrdma: Spread reply
processing over more CPUs") .
After some experimentation, I found that leaving the WQ bound and
allowing the scheduler to pick the dispatch CPU seems to eliminate
the long latencies, and it does not introduce any new regressions.
The fix is implemented by reverting only the part of
commit ccede7598588 ("xprtrdma: Spread reply processing over more
CPUs") that dispatches RPC replies specifically on the CPU where the
matching RPC call was made.
Interestingly, saving the CPU number and later queuing reply
processing there was effective \_only\_ for a NFS READ and WRITE
request. On my NUMA client, in-kernel RPC reply processing for
asynchronous RPCs was dispatched on the same CPU where the RPC call
was made, as expected. However synchronous RPCs seem to get their
reply dispatched on some other CPU than where the call was placed,
every time.

dm crypt: limit the number of allocated pages
commit 5059353df86e2573ccd9d43fd9d9396dcec47ca2 upstream.
dm-crypt consumes an excessive amount memory when the user attempts to
zero a dm-crypt device with "blkdiscard -z". The command "blkdiscard -z"
calls the BLKZEROOUT ioctl, it goes to the function \_\_blkdev\_issue\_zeroout,
\_\_blkdev\_issue\_zeroout sends a large amount of write bios that contain
the zero page as their payload.
For each incoming page, dm-crypt allocates another page that holds the
encrypted data, so when processing "blkdiscard -z", dm-crypt tries to
allocate the amount of memory that is equal to the size of the device.
This can trigger OOM killer or cause system crash.
Fix this by limiting the amount of memory that dm-crypt allocates to 2%
of total system memory. This limit is system-wide and is divided by the
number of active dm-crypt devices and each device receives an equal
share.

ext4: force revalidation of directory pointer after seekdir(2)
commit e40ff213898502d299351cc2fe1e350cd186f0d3 upstream.
A malicious user could force the directory pointer to be in an invalid
spot by using seekdir(2). Use the mechanism we already have to notice
if the directory has changed since the last time we called
ext4\_readdir() to force a revalidation of the pointer.

ext4: limit xattr size to INT\_MAX
commit ce3fd194fcc6fbdc00ce095a852f22df97baa401 upstream.
ext4 isn't validating the sizes of xattrs where the value of the xattr
is stored in an external inode. This is problematic because
->e\_value\_size is a u32, but ext4\_xattr\_get() returns an int. A very
large size is misinterpreted as an error code, which ext4\_get\_acl()
translates into a bogus ERR\_PTR() for which IS\_ERR() returns false,
causing a crash.
Fix this by validating that all xattrs are <= INT\_MAX bytes.
This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-1095.

ext4: fix offset overflow on 32-bit archs in ext4\_iomap\_begin()
commit fe23cb65c2c394ea306f3714a17d46ab2e6a0af1 upstream.
ext4\_iomap\_begin() has a bug where offset returned in the iomap
structure will be truncated to unsigned long size. On 64-bit
architectures this is fine but on 32-bit architectures obviously not.
Not many places actually use the offset stored in the iomap structure
but one of visible failures is in SEEK\_HOLE / SEEK\_DATA implementation.
If we create a file like:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=file bs=1k seek=8m count=1
then
lseek64("file", 0x100000000ULL, SEEK\_DATA)
wrongly returns 0x100000000 on unfixed kernel while it should return
0x200000000. Avoid the overflow by proper type cast.

commit 044e6e3d74a3d7103a0c8a9305dfd94d64000660 upstream.
When reading the inode or block allocation bitmap, if the bitmap needs
to be initialized, do not update the checksum in the block group
descriptor. That's because we're not set up to journal those changes.
Instead, just set the verified bit on the bitmap block, so that it's
not necessary to validate the checksum.
When a block or inode allocation actually happens, at that point the
checksum will be calculated, and update of the bg descriptor block
will be properly journalled.

block: use 32-bit blk\_status\_t on Alpha
commit 6e2fb22103b99c26ae30a46512abe75526d8e4c9 upstream.
Early alpha processors cannot write a single byte or word; they read 8
bytes, modify the value in registers and write back 8 bytes.
The type blk\_status\_t is defined as one byte, it is often written
asynchronously by I/O completion routines, this asynchronous modification
can corrupt content of nearby bytes if these nearby bytes can be written
simultaneously by another CPU.
- one example of such corruption is the structure dm\_io where
"blk\_status\_t status" is written by an asynchronous completion routine
and "atomic\_t io\_count" is modified synchronously
- another example is the structure dm\_buffer where "unsigned hold\_count"
is modified synchronously from process context and "blk\_status\_t
write\_error" is modified asynchronously from bio completion routine
This patch fixes the bug by changing the type blk\_status\_t to 32 bits if
we are on Alpha and if we are compiling for a processor that doesn't have
the byte-word-extension.

irqchip/gic: Take lock when updating irq type
commit aa08192a254d362a4d5317647a81de6996961aef upstream.
Most MMIO GIC register accesses use a 1-hot bit scheme that
avoids requiring any form of locking. This isn't true for the
GICD\_ICFGRn registers, which require a RMW sequence.
Unfortunately, we seem to be missing a lock for these particular
accesses, which could result in a race condition if changing the
trigger type on any two interrupts within the same set of 16
interrupts (and thus controlled by the same CFGR register).
Introduce a private lock in the GIC common comde for this
particular case, making it cover both GIC implementations
in one go.

ASoC: ssm2602: Replace reg\_default\_raw with reg\_default
commit a01df75ce737951ad13a08d101306e88c3f57cb2 upstream.
SSM2602 driver is broken on recent kernels (at least
since 4.9). User space applications such as amixer or
alsamixer get EIO when attempting to access codec
controls via the relevant IOCTLs.
Root cause of these failures is the regcache\_hw\_init
function in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c, which
prevents regmap cache initalization from the
reg\_defaults\_raw element of the regmap\_config structure
when registers are write only. It also disables the
regmap cache entirely when all registers are write only
or volatile as is the case for the SSM2602 driver.
Using the reg\_defaults element of the regmap\_config
structure rather than the reg\_defaults\_raw element to
initalize the regmap cache avoids the logic in the
regcache\_hw\_init function entirely. It also makes this
driver consistent with other ASoC codec drivers, as
this driver was the ONLY codec driver that used the
reg\_defaults\_raw element to initalize the cache.
Tested on Digilent Zybo Z7 development board which has
a SSM2603 codec chip connected to a Xilinx Zynq SoC.

HID: core: Fix size as type u32
commit 6de0b13cc0b4ba10e98a9263d7a83b940720b77a upstream.
When size is negative, calling memset will make segment fault.
Declare the size as type u32 to keep memset safe.
size in struct hid\_report is unsigned, fix return type of
hid\_report\_len to u32.

powerpc/mm/radix: Fix checkstops caused by invalid tlbiel
commit 2675c13b293a007b7b7f8229514126bd23df09a7 upstream.
In tlbiel\_radix\_set\_isa300() we use the PPC\_TLBIEL() macro to
construct tlbiel instructions. The instruction takes 5 fields, two of
which are registers, and the others are constants. But because it's
constructed with inline asm the compiler doesn't know that.
We got the constraint wrong on the 'r' field, using "r" tells the
compiler to put the value in a register. The value we then get in the
macro is the \*register number\*, not the value of the field.
That means when we mask the register number with 0x1 we get 0 or 1
depending on which register the compiler happens to put the constant
in, eg:
li r10,1
tlbiel r8,r9,2,0,0
li r7,1
tlbiel r10,r6,0,0,1
If we're unlucky we might generate an invalid instruction form, for
example RIC=0, PRS=1 and R=0, tlbiel r8,r7,0,1,0, this has been
observed to cause machine checks:
Oops: Machine check, sig: 7 [#1]

If the machine check happens early in boot while we have MSR\_ME=0 it
will escalate into a checkstop and kill the box entirely.
To fix it we could change the inline asm constraint to "i" which
tells the compiler the value is a constant. But a better fix is to just
pass a literal 1 into the macro, which bypasses any problems with inline
asm constraints.

powerpc/powernv: Fix OPAL NVRAM driver OPAL\_BUSY loops
commit 3b8070335f751aac9f1526ae2e012e6f5b8b0f21 upstream.
The OPAL NVRAM driver does not sleep in case it gets OPAL\_BUSY or
OPAL\_BUSY\_EVENT from firmware, which causes large scheduling
latencies, and various lockup errors to trigger (again, BMC reboot
can cause it).
Fix this by converting it to the standard form OPAL\_BUSY loop that
sleeps.

powerpc/powernv: define a standard delay for OPAL\_BUSY type retry loops
commit 34dd25de9fe3f60bfdb31b473bf04b28262d0896 upstream.
This is the start of an effort to tidy up and standardise all the
delays. Existing loops have a range of delay/sleep periods from 1ms
to 20ms, and some have no delay. They all loop forever except rtc,
which times out after 10 retries, and that uses 10ms delays. So use
10ms as our standard delay. The OPAL maintainer agrees 10ms is a
reasonable starting point.
The idea is to use the same recipe everywhere, once this is proven to
work then it will be documented as an OPAL API standard. Then both
firmware and OS can agree, and if a particular call needs something
else, then that can be documented with reasoning.
This is not the end-all of this effort, it's just a relatively easy
change that fixes some existing high latency delays. There should be
provision for standardising timeouts and/or interruptible loops where
possible, so non-fatal firmware errors don't cause hangs.

powerpc/kexec\_file: Fix error code when trying to load kdump kernel
commit bf8a1abc3ddbd6e9a8312ea7d96e5dd89c140f18 upstream.
kexec\_file\_load() on powerpc doesn't support kdump kernels yet, so it
returns -ENOTSUPP in that case.
I've recently learned that this errno is internal to the kernel and
isn't supposed to be exposed to userspace. Therefore, change to
-EOPNOTSUPP which is defined in an uapi header.
This does indeed make kexec-tools happier. Before the patch, on
ppc64le:
# ~bauermann/src/kexec-tools/build/sbin/kexec -s -p /boot/vmlinuz
kexec\_file\_load failed: Unknown error 524

This is showing up since OPTPROBES is now enabled with CONFIG\_PREEMPT.
trampoline\_probe\_handler() considers itself to be a special kprobe
handler for kretprobes. In doing so, it expects to be called from
kprobe\_handler() on a trap, and re-enables preemption before returning a
non-zero return value so as to suppress any subsequent processing of the
trap by the kprobe\_handler().
However, with optprobes, we don't deal with special handlers (we ignore
the return code) and just try to re-enable preemption causing the above
trace.
To address this, modify trampoline\_probe\_handler() to not be special.
The only additional processing done in kprobe\_handler() is to emulate
the instruction (in this case, a 'nop'). We adjust the value of
regs->nip for the purpose and delegate the job of re-enabling
preemption and resetting current kprobe to the probe handlers
(kprobe\_handler() or optimized\_callback()).

powerpc/64: Call H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL when running as a HPT guest on POWER9
commit dbfcf3cb9c681aa0c5d0bb46068f98d5b1823dd3 upstream.
On POWER9, since commit cc3d2940133d ("powerpc/64: Enable use of radix
MMU under hypervisor on POWER9", 2017-01-30), we set both the radix and
HPT bits in the client-architecture-support (CAS) vector, which tells
the hypervisor that we can do either radix or HPT. According to PAPR,
if we use this combination we are promising to do a H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL
hcall later on to let the hypervisor know whether we are doing radix
or HPT. We currently do this call if we are doing radix but not if
we are doing HPT. If the hypervisor is able to support both radix
and HPT guests, it would be entitled to defer allocation of the HPT
until the H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL call, and to fail any attempts to create
HPTEs until the H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL call. Thus we need to do a
H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL call when we are doing HPT; otherwise we may
crash at boot time.
This adds the code to call H\_REGISTER\_PROC\_TBL in this case, before
we attempt to create any HPT entries using H\_ENTER.

powerpc/64s: Fix dt\_cpu\_ftrs to have restore\_cpu clear unwanted LPCR bits
commit a57ac411832384eb93df4bfed2bf644c4089720e upstream.
Presently the dt\_cpu\_ftrs restore\_cpu will only add bits to the LPCR
for secondaries, but some bits must be removed (e.g., UPRT for HPT).
Not clearing these bits on secondaries causes checkstops when booting
with disable\_radix.
restore\_cpu can not just set LPCR, because it is also called by the
idle wakeup code which relies on opal\_slw\_set\_reg to restore the value
of LPCR, at least on P8 which does not save LPCR to stack in the idle
code.
Fix this by including a mask of bits to clear from LPCR as well, which
is used by restore\_cpu.
This is a little messy now, but it's a minimal fix that can be
backported. Longer term, the idle SPR save/restore code can be
reworked to completely avoid calls to restore\_cpu, then restore\_cpu
would be able to unconditionally set LPCR to match boot processor
environment.

The first part is an EEH (on boot), the second half is the resulting
crash. nvme probe starts the nvme\_reset\_work() worker thread. This
worker thread starts touching the device which see a device error
(EEH) and hence queues up an event in the powerpc EEH worker
thread. nvme\_reset\_work() then continues and runs
nvme\_remove\_dead\_ctrl\_work() which results in unbinding the driver
from the device and hence releases all resources. At the same time,
the EEH worker thread starts doing the EEH .error\_detected() driver
callback, which no longer works since the resources have been freed.
This fixes the problem in the same way the generic PCIe AER code (in
drivers/pci/pcie/aer/aerdrv\_core.c) does. It makes the EEH code hold
the device\_lock() while performing the driver EEH callbacks and
associated code. This ensures either the callbacks are no longer
register, or if they are registered the driver will not be removed
from underneath us.
This has been broken forever. The EEH call backs were first introduced
in 2005 (in 77bd7415610) but it's not clear if a lock was needed back
then.

On some systems, the BIOS expects certain SMBus register values to

commit 48f238a79f668f8ff013024d83010de551833d7f upstream.
During transport reconnect, other processes may have registered memory
and blocked on transport. This creates a deadlock situation because the
transport resources can't be freed, and reconnect is blocked.
Fix this by returning to upper layer on timeout. Before returning,
transport status is set to reconnecting so other processes will release
memory registration resources.
Upper layer will retry the reconnect. This is not in fast I/O path so

usb: dwc3: gadget: never call ->complete() from ->ep\_queue()
commit c91815b596245fd7da349ecc43c8def670d2269e upstream.
This is a requirement which has always existed but, somehow, wasn't
reflected in the documentation and problems weren't found until now
when Tuba Yavuz found a possible deadlock happening between dwc3 and
f\_hid. She described the situation as follows:
spin\_lock\_irqsave(&hidg->write\_spinlock, flags); // first acquire
/\* we our function has been disabled by host \*/
if (!hidg->req) {
free\_ep\_req(hidg->in\_ep, hidg->req);
goto try\_again;
}
[...]
status = usb\_ep\_queue(hidg->in\_ep, hidg->req, GFP\_ATOMIC);
=>
[...]
=> usb\_gadget\_giveback\_request
=>
f\_hidg\_req\_complete
=>
spin\_lock\_irqsave(&hidg->write\_spinlock, flags); // second acquire
Note that this happens because dwc3 would call ->complete() on a
failed usb\_ep\_queue() due to failed Start Transfer command. This is,
anyway, a theoretical situation because dwc3 currently uses "No
Response Update Transfer" command for Bulk and Interrupt endpoints.
It's still good to make this case impossible to happen even if the "No
Reponse Update Transfer" command is changed.

USB:fix USB3 devices behind USB3 hubs not resuming at hibernate thaw
commit 64627388b50158fd24d6ad88132525b95a5ef573 upstream.
USB3 hubs don't support global suspend.
USB3 specification 10.10, Enhanced SuperSpeed hubs only support selective
suspend and resume, they do not support global suspend/resume where the
hub downstream facing ports states are not affected.
When system enters hibernation it first enters freeze process where only
the root hub enters suspend, usb\_port\_suspend() is not called for other
devices, and suspend status flags are not set for them. Other devices are
expected to suspend globally. Some external USB3 hubs will suspend the
downstream facing port at global suspend. These devices won't be resumed
at thaw as the suspend status flag is not set.
A USB3 removable hard disk connected through a USB3 hub that won't resume
at thaw will fail to synchronize SCSI cache, return “cmd cmplt err -71”
error, and needs a 60 seconds timeout which causing system hang for 60s
before the USB host reset the port for the USB3 removable hard disk to
recover.
Fix this by always calling usb\_port\_suspend() during freeze for USB3
devices.

USB: gadget: f\_midi: fixing a possible double-free in f\_midi
commit 7fafcfdf6377b18b2a726ea554d6e593ba44349f upstream.
It looks like there is a possibility of a double-free vulnerability on an
error path of the f\_midi\_set\_alt function in the f\_midi driver. If the
path is feasible then free\_ep\_req gets called twice:
req->complete = f\_midi\_complete;
err = usb\_ep\_queue(midi->out\_ep, req, GFP\_ATOMIC);
=> ...
usb\_gadget\_giveback\_request
=>
f\_midi\_complete (CALLBACK)
(inside f\_midi\_complete, for various cases of status)
free\_ep\_req(ep, req); // first kfree
if (err) {
ERROR(midi, "%s: couldn't enqueue request: %d\n",
midi->out\_ep->name, err);
free\_ep\_req(midi->out\_ep, req); // second kfree
return err;
}
The double-free possibility was introduced with commit ad0d1a058eac

ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Check presence of slot itself in get\_slot\_status()
commit 13d3047c81505cc0fb9bdae7810676e70523c8bf upstream.
Mike Lothian reported that plugging in a USB-C device does not work
properly in his Dell Alienware system. This system has an Intel Alpine
Ridge Thunderbolt controller providing USB-C functionality. In these
systems the USB controller (xHCI) is hotplugged whenever a device is
connected to the port using ACPI-based hotplug.
The ACPI description of the root port in question is as follows:
Device (RP01)
{
Name (\_ADR, 0x001C0000)
Device (PXSX)
{
Name (\_ADR, 0x02)
Method (\_RMV, 0, NotSerialized)
{
// ...
}
}
Here \_ADR 0x02 means device 0, function 2 on the bus under root port (RP01)
but that seems to be incorrect because device 0 is the upstream port of the
Alpine Ridge PCIe switch and it has no functions other than 0 (the bridge
itself). When we get ACPI Notify() to the root port resulting from
connecting a USB-C device, Linux tries to read PCI\_VENDOR\_ID from device 0,
function 2 which of course always returns 0xffffffff because there is no
such function and we never find the device.
In Windows this works fine.
Now, since we get ACPI Notify() to the root port and not to the PXSX device
we should actually start our scan from there as well and not from the
non-existent PXSX device. Fix this by checking presence of the slot itself
(function 0) if we fail to do that otherwise.
While there use pci\_bus\_read\_dev\_vendor\_id() in get\_slot\_status(), which is
the recommended way to read Device and Vendor IDs of devices on PCI buses.

The only function affected would be regmap\_i2c\_smbus\_i2c\_write() in

limit check which returns an error if (count >= I2C\_SMBUS\_BLOCK\_MAX) so
it doesn't look like it has ever been able to do anything except return

media: vsp1: Fix BRx conditional path in WPF
commit 639fa43d59e5a41ca8c55592cd5c1021fea2ab83 upstream.
When a BRx is provided by a pipeline, the WPF must determine the master
layer. Currently the condition to check this identifies pipe->bru ||
pipe->num\_inputs > 1.
The code then moves on to dereference pipe->bru, thus the check fails
static analysers on the possibility that pipe->num\_inputs could be
greater than 1 without pipe->bru being set.
The reality is that the pipeline must have a BRx to support more than
one input, thus this could never cause a fault - however it also
identifies that the num\_inputs > 1 check is redundant.
Remove the redundant check - and always configure the master layer
appropriately when we have a BRx configured in our pipeline.

spi: Fix scatterlist elements size in spi\_map\_buf
commit ce99319a182fe766be67f96338386f3ec73e321c upstream.
When SPI transfers can be offloaded using DMA, the SPI core need to
build a scatterlist to make sure that the buffer to be transferred is
dma-able.
This patch fixes the scatterlist entry size computation in the case
where the maximum acceptable scatterlist entry supported by the DMA
controller is less than PAGE\_SIZE, when the buffer is vmalloced.
For each entry, the actual size is given by the minimum between the
desc\_len (which is the max buffer size supported by the DMA controller)
and the remaining buffer length until we cross a page boundary.

ARM: EXYNOS: Fix coupled CPU idle freeze on Exynos4210
commit a7480dbcf983c31d8111f864c848e8a75116a87d upstream.
Since commit 04c8b0f82c7d ("irqchip/gic: Make locking a BL\_SWITCHER only
feature") coupled CPU idle freezes from time to time on Exynos4210. Later
commit 313c8c16ee62 ("PM / CPU: replace raw\_notifier with atomic\_notifier")
changed the context in which the CPU idle code is executed, what results
in fully reproducible freeze all the time. However, almost the same coupled
CPU idle code works fine on Exynos3250 regardless of the changes made in
the mentioned commits.
It turned out that the IPI call used on Exynos4210 is conflicting with the
change done in the first mentioned commit in GIC. Fix this by using the
same code path as for Exynos3250, instead of the IPI call for
synchronization with second CPU core, call dsb\_sev() directly.
Tested on Exynos4210-based Trats and Origen boards.

KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Fix potential overrun in vgic\_copy\_lpi\_list
commit 7d8b44c54e0c7c8f688e3a07f17e6083f849f01f upstream.
vgic\_copy\_lpi\_list() parses the LPI list and picks LPIs targeting
a given vcpu. We allocate the array containing the intids before taking
the lpi\_list\_lock, which means we can have an array size that is not
equal to the number of LPIs.
This is particularly obvious when looking at the path coming from
vgic\_enable\_lpis, which is not a command, and thus can run in parallel
with commands:
vcpu 0: vcpu 1:
vgic\_enable\_lpis
its\_sync\_lpi\_pending\_table
vgic\_copy\_lpi\_list
intids = kmalloc\_array(irq\_count)
MAPI(lpi targeting vcpu 0)
list\_for\_each\_entry(lpi\_list\_head)
intids[i++] = irq->intid;
At that stage, we will happily overrun the intids array. Boo. An easy
fix is is to break once the array is full. The MAPI command will update
the config anyway, and we won't miss a thing. We also make sure that
lpi\_list\_count is read exactly once, so that further updates of that
value will not affect the array bound check.

phy: allwinner: sun4i-usb: poll vbus changes on A23/A33 when driving VBUS
commit d7119224bfe6e8efbf821a52db7da9530d790f07 upstream.
The AXP223 PMIC, like the AXP221, does not generate VBUS change
interrupts when N\_VBUSEN is used to drive VBUS for the OTG port
on the board.
This was not noticed until recently, as most A23/A33 boards use
a GPIO pin that does not support interrupts for OTG ID detection.
This forces the driver to use polling. However the A33-OlinuXino
uses a pin that does support interrupts, so the driver uses them.
However the VBUS interrupt never fires, and the driver never gets
to update the VBUS status. This results in musb timing out waiting
for VBUS to rise.
This was worked around for the AXP221 by resorting to polling
changes in commit 91d96f06a760 ("phy-sun4i-usb: Add workaround for
missing Vbus det interrupts on A31"). This patch adds the A23 and
A33 to the list of SoCs that need the workaround.

mm, slab: reschedule cache\_reap() on the same CPU
commit a9f2a846f0503e7d729f552e3ccfe2279010fe94 upstream.
cache\_reap() is initially scheduled in start\_cpu\_timer() via
schedule\_delayed\_work\_on(). But then the next iterations are scheduled
via schedule\_delayed\_work(), i.e. using WORK\_CPU\_UNBOUND.
Thus since commit ef557180447f ("workqueue: schedule WORK\_CPU\_UNBOUND
work on wq\_unbound\_cpumask CPUs") there is no guarantee the future
iterations will run on the originally intended cpu, although it's still
preferred. I was able to demonstrate this with
/sys/module/workqueue/parameters/debug\_force\_rr\_cpu. IIUC, it may also
happen due to migrating timers in nohz context. As a result, some cpu's
would be calling cache\_reap() more frequently and others never.
This patch uses schedule\_delayed\_work\_on() with the current cpu when
scheduling the next iteration.

ipc/shm: fix use-after-free of shm file via remap\_file\_pages()
commit 3f05317d9889ab75c7190dcd39491d2a97921984 upstream.
syzbot reported a use-after-free of shm\_file\_data(file)->file->f\_op in
shm\_get\_unmapped\_area(), called via sys\_remap\_file\_pages().
Unfortunately it couldn't generate a reproducer, but I found a bug which
I think caused it. When remap\_file\_pages() is passed a full System V
shared memory segment, the memory is first unmapped, then a new map is
created using the ->vm\_file. Between these steps, the shm ID can be
removed and reused for a new shm segment. But, shm\_mmap() only checks
whether the ID is currently valid before calling the underlying file's
->mmap(); it doesn't check whether it was reused. Thus it can use the
wrong underlying file, one that was already freed.
Fix this by making the "outer" shm file (the one that gets put in
->vm\_file) hold a reference to the real shm file, and by making
\_\_shm\_open() require that the file associated with the shm ID matches
the one associated with the "outer" file.
Taking the reference to the real shm file is needed to fully solve the
problem, since otherwise sfd->file could point to a freed file, which
then could be reallocated for the reused shm ID, causing the wrong shm
segment to be mapped (and without the required permission checks).
Commit 1ac0b6dec656 ("ipc/shm: handle removed segments gracefully in
shm\_mmap()") almost fixed this bug, but it didn't go far enough because
it didn't consider the case where the shm ID is reused.
The following program usually reproduces this bug:
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main()
{
int is\_parent = (fork() != 0);
srand(getpid());
for (;;) {
int id = shmget(0xF00F, 4096, IPC\_CREAT|0700);
if (is\_parent) {
void \*addr = shmat(id, NULL, 0);
usleep(rand() % 50);
while (!syscall(\_\_NR\_remap\_file\_pages, addr, 4096, 0, 0, 0));
} else {
usleep(rand() % 50);
shmctl(id, IPC\_RMID, NULL);
}
}
}
It causes the following NULL pointer dereference due to a 'struct file'
being used while it's being freed. (I couldn't actually get a KASAN
use-after-free splat like in the syzbot report. But I think it's
possible with this bug; it would just take a more extraordinary race...)

resource: fix integer overflow at reallocation
commit 60bb83b81169820c691fbfa33a6a4aef32aa4b0b upstream.
We've got a bug report indicating a kernel panic at booting on an x86-32
system, and it turned out to be the invalid PCI resource assigned after
reallocation. \_\_find\_resource() first aligns the resource start address
and resets the end address with start+size-1 accordingly, then checks
whether it's contained. Here the end address may overflow the integer,
although resource\_contains() still returns true because the function
validates only start and end address. So this ends up with returning an
invalid resource (start > end).
There was already an attempt to cover such a problem in the commit
47ea91b4052d ("Resource: fix wrong resource window calculation"), but
this case is an overseen one.
This patch adds the validity check of the newly calculated resource for
avoiding the integer overflow problem.

commit 31286a8484a85e8b4e91ddb0f5415aee8a416827 upstream.
Recently the following BUG was reported:
Injecting memory failure for pfn 0x3c0000 at process virtual address 0x7fe300000000
Memory failure: 0x3c0000: recovery action for huge page: Recovered
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff8dfcc0003000
IP: gup\_pgd\_range+0x1f0/0xc20
PGD 17ae72067 P4D 17ae72067 PUD 0
Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
...
CPU: 3 PID: 5467 Comm: hugetlb\_1gb Not tainted 4.15.0-rc8-mm1-abc+ #3
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.9.3-1.fc25 04/01/2014
You can easily reproduce this by calling madvise(MADV\_HWPOISON) twice on
a 1GB hugepage. This happens because get\_user\_pages\_fast() is not aware
of a migration entry on pud that was created in the 1st madvise() event.
I think that conversion to pud-aligned migration entry is working, but
other MM code walking over page table isn't prepared for it. We need
some time and effort to make all this work properly, so this patch
avoids the reported bug by just disabling error handling for 1GB
hugepage.

mm/hmm: hmm\_pfns\_bad() was accessing wrong struct
commit c719547f032d4610c7a20900baacae26d0b1ff3e upstream.
The private field of mm\_walk struct point to an hmm\_vma\_walk struct and
not to the hmm\_range struct desired. Fix to get proper struct pointer.

mm/hmm: fix header file if/else/endif maze
commit b28b08de436a638c82d0cf3dcdbdbad055baf1fc upstream.
The #if/#else/#endif for IS\_ENABLED(CONFIG\_HMM) were wrong. Because of
this after multiple include there was multiple definition of both
hmm\_mm\_init() and hmm\_mm\_destroy() leading to build failure if HMM was
enabled (CONFIG\_HMM set).

mm/ksm.c: fix inconsistent accounting of zero pages
commit a38c015f3156895b07e71d4e4414289f8a3b2745 upstream.
When using KSM with use\_zero\_pages, we replace anonymous pages
containing only zeroes with actual zero pages, which are not anonymous.
We need to do proper accounting of the mm counters, otherwise we will
get wrong values in /proc and a BUG message in dmesg when tearing down
the mm.

While UBI and UBIFS seem to work at first sight with MLC NAND, you will
most likely lose all your data upon a power-cut or due to read/write

In order to protect users from bad surprises, refuse to attach to MLC

ubi: Fix error for write access
commit 78a8dfbabbece22bee58ac4cb26cab10e7a19c5d upstream.
When opening a device with write access, ubiblock\_open returns an error
code. Currently, this error code is -EPERM, but this is not the right
value.
The open function for other block devices returns -EROFS when opening
read-only devices with FMODE\_WRITE set. When used with dm-verity, the
veritysetup userspace tool is expecting EROFS, and refuses to use the
ubiblock device.
Use -EROFS for ubiblock as well. As a result, veritysetup accepts the
ubiblock device as valid.

cpufreq: CPPC: Use transition\_delay\_us depending transition\_latency
commit 3d41386d556db9f720e00de3e11e45f39cb5071c upstream.
With commit e948bc8fbee0 (cpufreq: Cap the default transition delay
value to 10 ms) the cpufreq was not honouring the delay passed via
ACPI (PCCT). Due to which on ARM based platforms using CPPC the
cpufreq governor tries to change the frequency of CPUs faster than
expected.
This leads to continuous error messages like the following.
" ACPI CPPC: PCC check channel failed. Status=0 "
Earlier (without above commit) the default transition delay was
taken form the value passed from PCCT. Use the same value provided
by PCCT to set the transition\_delay\_us.

USB: gadget: f\_midi: fixing a possible double-free in f\_midiIt looks like there is a possibility of a double-free vulnerability on an
error path of the f\_midi\_set\_alt function in the f\_midi driver. If the
path is feasible then free\_ep\_req gets called twice:
req->complete = f\_midi\_complete;
err = usb\_ep\_queue(midi->out\_ep, req, GFP\_ATOMIC);
=> ...
usb\_gadget\_giveback\_request
=>
f\_midi\_complete (CALLBACK)
(inside f\_midi\_complete, for various cases of status)
free\_ep\_req(ep, req); // first kfree
if (err) {
ERROR(midi, "%s: couldn't enqueue request: %d\n",
midi->out\_ep->name, err);
free\_ep\_req(midi->out\_ep, req); // second kfree
return err;
}
The double-free possibility was introduced with commit ad0d1a058eac
("usb: gadget: f\_midi: fix leak on failed to enqueue out requests").
Found by MOXCAFE tool.

It looks like there is a possibility of a double-free vulnerability on an
error path of the f_midi_set_alt function in the f_midi driver. If the
path is feasible then free_ep_req gets called twice:

         req->complete = f_midi_complete;
         err = usb_ep_queue(midi->out_ep, req, GFP_ATOMIC);
            => ...
             usb_gadget_giveback_request
               =>
                 f_midi_complete (CALLBACK)
                   (inside f_midi_complete, for various cases of status)
                   free_ep_req(ep, req); // first kfree
         if (err) {
                 ERROR(midi, "%s: couldn't enqueue request: %d\n",
                             midi->out_ep->name, err);
                 free_ep_req(midi->out_ep, req); // second kfree
                 return err;
         }

The double-free possibility was introduced with commit [ad0d1a0](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ad0d1a058eac46503edbc510d1ce44c5df8e0c91)
("usb: gadget: f_midi: fix leak on failed to enqueue out requests").
