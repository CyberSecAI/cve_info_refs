{
  "CVE-2018-20737": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization of the 'scopeName' parameter within the 'edit-oidc-claims-finish-ajaxprocessor.jsp' file, which allows for the injection of arbitrary code.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by users. This could result in the attacker gaining control of user sessions, performing actions on the victim's behalf, and potentially stealing sensitive information.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the manipulation of the 'scopeName' parameter within the URL that leads to the vulnerable 'edit-oidc-claims-finish-ajaxprocessor.jsp' page. The injected script is then reflected back to the user.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would require the ability to construct a malicious URL and then lure a high privileged user (an admin) to click the link. The attacker also needs knowledge of the target application's functionality to craft a meaningful attack payload."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is a reflected XSS vulnerability found within the WSO2 API Manager, carbon part of the product.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Reflected XSS",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL that reflects malicious Javascript code, triggered when a user (admin) accesses the link.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure an admin user into accessing a crafted URL containing the malicious script. This requires the attacker to be able to interact with the admin user."
