Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-20184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `WriteTGAImage` function within the `tga.c` file of GraphicsMagick. This occurs because the function does not properly validate the image's row and column values, potentially leading to an overflow when writing image data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `WriteTGAImage` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted image file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted TGA image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TGA image file that will be processed by GraphicsMagick. This can occur in scenarios where GraphicsMagick is used to process user-uploaded images or images from untrusted sources.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves adding validation to reject images with row or column sizes exceeding 65535 pixels. This prevents the heap buffer overflow when writing the image data.
