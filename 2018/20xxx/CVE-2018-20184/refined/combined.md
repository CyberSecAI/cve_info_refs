## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [graphicsmagick](/security/cves?package=graphicsmagick) - collection of image processing tools

## Details

It was discovered that GraphicsMagick incorrectly handled certain image files.

An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other

unspecified impact.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [graphicsmagick](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick)
  -
  [1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick/1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1)
* [libgraphicsmagick++-q16-12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick)
  -
  [1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick/1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1)
* [libgraphicsmagick-q16-3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick)
  -
  [1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/graphicsmagick/1.3.28-2ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Package        : graphicsmagick
Version        : 1.3.20-3+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20184 CVE-2018-20185 CVE-2018-20189
Debian Bug     : 916752 916719 916721

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GraphicsMagick, the image
processing system.

CVE-2018-20184

    The WriteTGAImage function (tga.c) is affected by a heap-based buffer
    overflow. Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to cause
    a denial of service via a crafted image file.

CVE-2018-20185

    The ReadBMPImage function (bmp.c) is affected by a heap-based buffer
    over-read. Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to cause
    a denial of service via a crafted image file.

CVE-2018-20189

    The ReadDIBImage function (coders/dib.c) is affected by an assertion
    error. Remote attackers might leverage this vulnerability to cause
    a denial of service via a crafted image file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.20-3+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.

## Binary packages built by this source

[graphicsmagick](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick):
collection of image processing tools

GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate

Â image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers

Â a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

Â .

Â The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used

Â jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image

Â formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,

Â concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create

Â thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available

Â from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that

Â allows interactive manipulation.

Â .

Â Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed

Â through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and

Â ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package

Â graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables

Â that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

[graphicsmagick-dbg](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-dbg):
format-independent image processing - debugging symbols

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â image formats.

Â .

Â The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers

Â an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable

Â across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the

Â GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,

Â conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Â .

Â This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the

Â C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these

Â symbols.

[graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat):
image processing tools providing ImageMagick interface

GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate

Â image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers

Â a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

Â .

Â With this package installed, the GraphicsMagick command line tools can

Â be executed like their ImageMagick counterparts. It allows one to migrate

Â scripts from ImageMagick to GraphicsMagick without any code changes.

[graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat):
image processing libraries providing ImageMagick interface

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â image formats.

Â .

Â The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer

Â programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be

Â small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible

Â subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.

Â .

Â While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and

Â helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package

Â intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick

Â interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only

Â tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of

Â ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

Â .

Â This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl

Â libraries.

[libgraphics-magick-perl](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/libgraphics-magick-perl):
format-independent image processing - perl interface

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

Â write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the

Â widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or

Â image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained

Â image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various

Â image formats.

Â .

Â The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers

Â an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable

Â across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the

Â GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,

Â conversion can usually be done with little effort.

Â .

Â This package contains the classes to access GraphicsMagick functionality from

Â Perl scripts. It is mostly similar to PerlMagick from the ImageMagick suite,

Â but uses a different class name.

[libgraphicsmagick++-q16-12](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/libgraphicsmagick%2B%2B-q16-12):
format-independent image processing - C++ shared library

GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in Graphicsmagick: Various memory
handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitising
may result in denial of service, memory disclosure or the execution
of arbitrary code if malformed media files are processed.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.30+hg15796-1~deb9u3.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4~hg15978-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.
