Based on the provided information, this issue is related to a crash in Bento4 version 1.5.1-627 when processing a crafted MP4 file, and it is relevant to CVE-2018-20659 because it describes a memory allocation failure due to a crafted input.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted MP4 file (`crash7.mp4`) triggers a memory allocation failure in `Ap4StcoAtom.cpp` at line 81. This suggests a flaw in how the software parses or handles specific data within the MP4 file format, leading to the allocation of a large amount of memory.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is an uncontrolled memory allocation due to the way the `AP4_StcoAtom` class parses the input. The program attempts to allocate a large amount of memory (4294975488 bytes or 0x100002000) which results in allocation failure. The ASAN output indicates the `new[]` operator fails within the constructor of `AP4_StcoAtom`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the program crashing. This prevents the `mp42hls` tool from processing the crafted MP4 file, and potentially other files, if a service is impacted by the vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted MP4 file. By providing such a file as input to the `mp42hls` tool, an attacker can trigger the memory allocation failure and subsequent crash.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed MP4 file to the Bento4 tool, specifically the `mp42hls` binary. No special position or capabilities are described in the issue.
