Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `soapcgi_main` function of the `cgibin` binary in D-Link routers.
*   The `/soap.cgi` HTTP POST endpoint on port `49152` is vulnerable.
*   The `service` GET parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands through the vulnerable `service` parameter.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The firmware attempts to filter some characters using the `strchr` function, but it does not fully cover all dangerous characters, specifically `&&`.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication, making it easier for remote attackers to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the vulnerable D-Link router.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can gain complete control over the device, potentially leading to data theft, denial of service, or using the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/soap.cgi` endpoint on port `49152`.
*   **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The `service` parameter in the URL is manipulated to inject the malicious OS command.
*   **Specific Payload:** The proof of concept (PoC) uses the `&&` characters to chain commands. For example, the following payload can be used:
    ```
    /soap.cgi?service=&&iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT&&iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT&&iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT&&iptables -t nat -P PREROUTING ACCEPT&&iptables -t nat -P OUTPUT ACCEPT&&iptables -t nat -P POSTROUTING ACCEPT&&telnetd -p 9999&&
    ```
    This particular PoC opens a telnet daemon on port 9999, allowing remote access to the device's shell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable device, which typically means being on the same network or having external access to port 49152 on the router.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific URL path `/soap.cgi` and the port `49152` where the exploit is located.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to craft HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.
*   **Basic understanding of shell commands:** needed to craft a useful payload.

**Affected Devices and Firmware:**

*   D-Link DIR-818LW\_REVA - Firmware version 2.05.B03
*   D-Link DIR-860L\_REVB - Firmware version 2.03.B03

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains PoC exploit code, highlighting how easy it is to trigger the vulnerability once discovered.
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-6530, but the existing sanitization was not comprehensive and could be bypassed using `&&`.

In summary, CVE-2018-20114 is a critical vulnerability allowing for unauthenticated remote command execution on specific D-Link router models due to insufficient input sanitization of the `service` parameter in the `/soap.cgi` endpoint.
