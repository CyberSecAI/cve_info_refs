Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20326:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the PLC Wireless Router's web interface, specifically within the URL parameters used to load pages. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the router's web interface directly includes unsanitized user-supplied input (the injected JavaScript) in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's session.
- **Session ID Theft:** Stealing session IDs allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Credentials Theft:** Attackers might be able to capture usernames, passwords, or other sensitive data entered by users on the compromised web page.
- **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect victims to malicious websites, potentially leading to further exploitation such as malware infections.
- **User Compromise:** By exploiting XSS, the attacker can compromise the user who is interacting with the vulnerable router interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code as a parameter. The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on the crafted link to trigger the attack.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker may use phishing or other social engineering techniques to trick users into visiting the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Router:** The attacker needs to know that the specific PLC Wireless Router model (GPN2.4P21-C-CN) and firmware (W2001EN-00) are vulnerable to this XSS attack.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the XSS payload.
- **Ability to Send Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to send or deliver a malicious URL to the victim.
- **No Authentication Required For Attack:** While login is needed to view the page, the XSS attack works after authentication has been achieved.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the GPN2.4P21-C-CN model with firmware version W2001EN-00.
- The attack is performed by appending a JavaScript payload to the URL parameters, which are not sanitized before being included in the web page.
- The provided example payload is `<script>alert("XSS-Saurav")</script>`.

In summary, this is a classic reflected XSS vulnerability that allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session with the vulnerable router. This can lead to serious security breaches, including theft of sensitive data and further exploitation.
