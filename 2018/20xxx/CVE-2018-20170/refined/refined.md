Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a timing oracle in the core authentication plugin of OpenStack Keystone. The response times for authentication requests to the `/v3/auth/tokens` endpoint are significantly different based on whether the username is valid or invalid. Valid usernames result in longer response times compared to invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Oracle:** The core weakness is the timing difference in responses which leaks information about the validity of a provided username.
- **User Enumeration:** An attacker can exploit this timing difference to enumerate valid usernames by sending multiple authentication requests with different usernames and observing the response times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to discover valid usernames on the OpenStack system. This information could be used in subsequent attacks, such as brute-force password attempts.
- **Increased Attack Surface:**  Knowing valid usernames increases the effectiveness of brute force attempts and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted authentication requests to the `/v3/auth/tokens` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenStack Keystone API endpoint.
- **Ability to send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the authentication endpoint and measure the response times.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenStack Keystone through version 14.0.1
- The timing difference is noticeable, with valid usernames resulting in response times greater than 600ms compared to invalid usernames that respond in under 150ms
- The bug report also indicates that this timing difference can be used to enumerate valid domains
- The OpenStack team initially categorized it as a "Class D" hardening opportunity and not necessarily a security issue that warranted a security advisory, however, they do acknowledge that fixes are welcome.
- A fix was proposed, but then abandoned and the bug was eventually triaged as "Wishlist" status.
- The vulnerability is publicly disclosed via a public bug report.
