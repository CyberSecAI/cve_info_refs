The provided content is related to a commit that fixes multiple potential vulnerabilities and bugs in the OpenJPEG library. One of the fixes specifically addresses "divisions by zero / undefined behavior on shift" in `src/lib/openmj2/pi.c`, within the `pi_next_rpcl`, `pi_next_pcrl`, and `pi_next_cprl` functions. While this commit is part of a larger effort to fix multiple issues, the description and code changes point towards a potential division by zero vulnerability. However, the content doesn't directly mention the specific CVE-2018-20845.

Based on the information provided, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability addressed in this particular commit:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from potential divisions by zero or undefined behavior during bitwise shift operations within the functions mentioned in `src/lib/openmj2/pi.c`. The shifts were performed using variables `rpx` and `rpy`, derived from `res->pdx + levelno` and `res->pdy + levelno` respectively, with insufficient validation on the resulting shift values.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow (in rpx and rpy) that could lead to a bit-shift by an amount greater than the size of the integer which could also lead to a division-by-zero.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes, denial-of-service or potentially other memory corruption issues.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability would be triggered by a specially crafted MJ2 image processed by the library. The specific values within the image could be crafted to trigger the specific conditions that lead to the division by zero or bit-shift issue.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide the crafted MJ2 image to a system using the affected version of OpenJPEG. The attacker does not need privileged access to the system, only the ability to get the system to process a malicious image.

**Note:** Although the commit description contains "division by zero" that's not actually the real issue; the issue is with the bit shift operation, where the value of `rpx` or `rpy` can become a value that causes undefined behaviour in the bit-shift operation (shift by a number greater than the size of the integer) which could also be leveraged to perform a division by zero in further operations.
