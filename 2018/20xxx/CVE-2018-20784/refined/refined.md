      "description": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-20784. It describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's CFS scheduler that can lead to a denial of service. The content is extracted from various sources including Red Hat and Ubuntu security advisories, and a kernel commit message.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop in the `update_blocked_averages()` function within the kernel's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) due to incorrect manipulation of the `rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list`.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect list manipulation in the CFS scheduler",
           "Lack of proper checks for the state of cfs_rq instances",
           "Improper handling of cfs_rq throttling."
        ],
        "impact": "A local attacker can trigger an infinite loop leading to a denial of service. The system will become unresponsive or crash due to the infinite loop consuming CPU resources.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Local attack by inducing a high load on the system",
          "Potentially remotely via initiating a magnitude of remote requests (less likely)"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system with the ability to create high loads on the system, possibly requiring specific process scheduling manipulations. No special user privileges required for local attacks."
      },
         "additional_details": "The content includes information beyond the official CVE description, including a detailed explanation of the root cause by Vincent Guittot, details on impacted kernel versions and a manual revert commit by Linus Torvalds. Several sources indicate the vulnerability was addressed by reverting commit a9e7f6544b9c. The impact and attack vector details also provide further specifics compared to the standard CVE description."
