Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20662:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a mishandling of xref data structures within the `PDFDoc::setup` class in the `PDFDoc.cc` file. Specifically, a crafted PDF file that corrupts the xref data structure can trigger this vulnerability. This can occur during the `extractPDFSubtype` processing. 
- Additionally, a related issue involves mishandling of objects in the Object.h file leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect handling of XRef entries:** The code does not validate the integrity of xref data during PDF parsing, leading to potential access to invalid memory locations or a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of service:**  An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application (SIGABRT) due to the memory corruption or segmentation fault caused by processing a malicious PDF.
-  **Potential Arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicit, some sources suggest the possibility of unspecified arbitrary code execution due to the memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

-  **Malicious PDF file:**  The attack vector is a crafted PDF file containing a malformed XRef data structure.
-  The crafted PDF file is processed by a system that utilizes the vulnerable poppler library. An automated system processing the PDF could also be a vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to craft a PDF file**: The attacker needs to be able to create a PDF file with a specially crafted xref data structure.
- **No special position required**: An attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position to exploit the vulnerability, provided they can deliver a malicious PDF to the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by issues related to the `extractPDFSubtype` procedure. This function may lead to a reconstruction that breaks xref.
* The vulnerability leads to a `SIGABRT` signal, indicating an abort condition was reached, typically due to an assertion failure or a more serious problem leading to an application crash.
* Multiple bug reports note that the crash occurs because the method `Object::getDict` attempts to dereference an invalid pointer (specifically using the Object.h:258 pointer).
* The fix involves returning `xref->isOK()` instead of unconditionally returning true, which checks the status of the xref table, thereby preventing the crash.
* Different patches/fixes were implemented in different versions of the software. Some of these fixes had to be reverted due to causing other issues.
