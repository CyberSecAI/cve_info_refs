- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an authentication bypass in the web-GUI configuration interface, which, when exploited, allows for authenticated remote command execution (RCE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Authentication bypass
    - Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user on the LAN to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web-GUI configuration interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and on the LAN-side of the device.
