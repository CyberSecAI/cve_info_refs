Based on the provided content:

**CVE-2018-20053**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Command injection vulnerability exists in the hostname, timezone, and NTP server configurations of the Cerner Connectivity Engine (CCE) device. This is due to the device processing a specially crafted configuration file sent over the network.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary vulnerability is command injection. The CCE device does not properly sanitize or validate input when processing configuration data, allowing an attacker to insert malicious commands.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution on the CCE device. This means an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially gaining full control over the device.
*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. The attacker sends an unauthenticated, specially crafted configuration file to the CCE device over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable CCE device. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker does not need any specific position in the network, as the vulnerability is triggered through network interaction.

The provided content gives more detail than the description, specifying that the hostname, timezone, and NTP server configurations are the vulnerable components.
