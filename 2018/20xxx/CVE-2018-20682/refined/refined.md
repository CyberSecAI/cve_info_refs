The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ForkCMS 5.0.6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving the "Admin ids" in the "Facebook" section under settings, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is loaded.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not adequately sanitize the user-provided `facebook_admin_ids` parameter before storing it, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Modifying the content of the page.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `facebook_admin_ids` parameter via the POST request to the settings page.
- The XSS payload is triggered when the user hovers the mouse over the "Admin ids" input field on the settings page, which is where the unsanitized data is reflected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a logged-in user with the necessary permissions to access and modify the settings page.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the settings page, including the `forkcms_path`.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a POST request with the malicious payload.
