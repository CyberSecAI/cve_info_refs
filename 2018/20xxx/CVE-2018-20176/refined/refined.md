Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-20176:

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-20176 is a vulnerability in rdesktop versions up to and including v1.8.3. It involves several out-of-bounds reads in the `secure.c` file, leading to a denial of service (segfault). This vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious RDP server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient bounds checking within the `secure.c` file of the rdesktop client, leading to out-of-bounds read operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** Multiple instances of out-of-bounds reads exist in the `secure.c` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service due to a segfault in the rdesktop client.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be carried out over a network by a malicious RDP server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Malicious RDP Server:** The attacker needs to control an RDP server that the vulnerable client connects to.
-   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the target system.
-   **Low Complexity:** The vulnerability is of low complexity making it easy to exploit.
