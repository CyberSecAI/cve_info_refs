Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of photo files within the LibRaw library. Specifically, it involves a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `copy_bayer()` function, as evidenced by the provided crash information from the GitHub issue. The crash occurs at line 3609 of `src/libraw_cxx.cpp`, within the OpenMP parallel region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The segmentation fault indicates a memory access violation, likely due to an out-of-bounds write or read, or dereferencing a null or dangling pointer within the `copy_bayer()` function. This suggests a potential buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability when processing the crafted image.
*   **Concurrency Issue:** The crash occurs within an OpenMP parallel region, which suggests a possible race condition or shared memory access issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash can lead to a denial-of-service, where applications using LibRaw to process image files will terminate unexpectedly.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu security notice mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code," suggesting a more severe potential outcome of exploitation. While the provided crash information directly points to a DoS, memory corruption bugs can often be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Photo Files:** The attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted photo file.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability occurs when a program uses LibRaw to process a malicious image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted Image:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a specific type of malformed image file.
*   **Target Program Using LibRaw:** The attacker must target a program using the vulnerable LibRaw library.
*   **Delivery Method:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to process the malicious image file using the vulnerable library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The GitHub issue provides a crash report, a link to the vulnerable commit, and a sample crash file.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3989-1) confirms that this CVE is associated with other LibRaw vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in the following package versions:
    *   Ubuntu 18.10: libraw16 0.18.13-1ubuntu0.1
    *   Ubuntu 18.04: libraw16 0.18.8-1ubuntu0.3
    *   Ubuntu 16.04: libraw15 0.17.1-1ubuntu0.5
*   The `copy_bayer` function is implicated.
