The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4, but it **does not relate to CVE-2018-20789.** The content states that the CVE is "N/A" for the described vulnerabilities.

Here's a summary of the vulnerabilities found:

**1. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (get_file action):**

*   **Root cause:** The `get_file` action in `ajax_calls.php` is vulnerable to path traversal through the `path` parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `action=get_file`, `sub_action=edit`, and `preview_mode=text` along with a crafted `path` parameter.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**2. Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal (copy_cut & paste_clipboard actions):**

*   **Root cause:** The `copy_cut` action in `ajax_calls.php` and `paste_clipboard` action in `execute.php` are vulnerable to path traversal through the `path` parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing the copy operation to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by copying them to the upload directory.
*  **Attack vector:** First, sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with `action=copy_cut`, `sub_action=copy` and a malicious `path` to copy the target file to session storage, and then sending a POST request to `execute.php` with `action=paste_clipboard` to write the file to the server's upload directory.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests and knowledge of application session.

**3. Arbitrary File Write via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (create_file action):**

*   **Root cause:**  The `create_file` action in `execute.php` is vulnerable to a path traversal bypass by using an array for paths and names parameters.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal bypass, allowing file creation in arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can create arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=create_file` along with `paths[0]` and `names[0]` containing the malicious path and filename.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**4. Arbitrary File Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (delete_file action):**

*  **Root cause:** The `delete_file` action in `execute.php` is vulnerable to a path traversal bypass by using an array for paths parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal bypass, allowing file deletion in arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=delete_file` along with a `paths[0]` parameter containing the malicious path.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**5. Arbitrary Directory Deletion via Path Traversal Mitigation Bypass (delete_folder action):**

*  **Root cause:** The `delete_folder` action in `execute.php` is vulnerable to a path traversal bypass by using an array for paths parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal bypass, allowing directory deletion in arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary directories on the server.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `execute.php` with the `action=delete_folder` along with a `paths[0]` parameter containing the malicious path.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests.

**6. Arbitrary File Write (restricted extension) with `save_img` action:**

*   **Root cause:** The `save_img` action in `ajax_calls.php` is vulnerable to path traversal using the `path` parameter.
*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal, allowing writing an image file (jpg/jpeg/png) to an arbitrary location on the server.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary image files to the server.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `ajax_calls.php` with the `action=save_img` along with `path`, `name` and `url` parameters containing the malicious path, filename and a URL to retrieve the content of the file to write.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires knowledge of the vulnerable application, and the ability to send HTTP requests and access to a URL to download an image to save.

**7. Persistent XSS in `media_preview` action:**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize file names when previewing media.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who preview the uploaded file.
*   **Attack vector:** Upload a file with a media extension (e.g., mp3) with an XSS payload in its name. When the file is previewed, the payload executes.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Requires the ability to upload files to the server.
