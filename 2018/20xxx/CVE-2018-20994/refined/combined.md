## Package

cargo

trust-dns-proto
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.3

## Patched versions

0.4.3

## Description

There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a malicious DNS packet. Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be parsed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a
malicious DNS packet.

Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message
compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite
loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be
parsed.

This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed
with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.

The flaw was corrected by trust-dns-proto 0.4.3 and upcoming 0.5.0 release.
