| [Description](#c0)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 11:39:48 UTC  ``` installed packages x11-base/xorg-x11: 6.7.0 kde-base/kdelibs: 3.3.1 kde-base/kdebase: 3.3.1  I didn't upgrade my xorg-x11 yet.  So I use 6.7.0-r2 instead of 6.8.0-r1, which shows up on `emerge -Dup world` since a couple of days.  On Nov 04 I upgraded kdelibs and kdebase from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1 and directly afterwards got this from `emerge -Dup world`:  [ebuild     U ] x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 [6.7.0-r2] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.0 [3.3.1] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.0 [3.3.1]  How could portage tell me to update packages which it calls me to downgrade directly afterwards?  I thought it to be a short-time thing resolved by the next sync. So I waited for this next sync, which was today.  For today I got the same result and I decided to downgrade these two packages, kdelibs and kdebase.  I first did an `emerge -Dup kdelibs kdebase` to show what would happen and I got this:  [ebuild     U ] x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 [6.7.0-r2]  Why didn't portage tell me about any dependency the day before?   And I thought it to be a problem with the -Du options and tried `emerge -p kdelibs kdebase` and got this:  [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.1 [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.1  How should this resolve the issue?  I am not delighted by this situation: - If kdelibs and kdebase really depend on the new version of xorg-x11 there should have been anything telling me about this.  But this didn't happen.  And I don't see why it should, 3.3.1 works fine with 6.7.0. - I can't understand how I was able to upgrade two packages without any complaint and directly afterwards to get the information to downgrade again, because of some dependency problem not being resolved before. - If I try to downgrade these packages then I don't want to upgrade another package or re-emerge these packages again, both results not being able to resolve what `emerge -Dup world` told about the status of these packages.  My main concern about all this is not anything with these three packages but with portage not resolving this issue properly and leaving one in a situation I don't see stable (in it's messages, not it's installation).   bye  caspar   Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. get a system with xorg-x11 6.7.0.r2 and kdelibs/kdebase 3.3.0 2. emerge -Dup world 3. emerge -v kdelibs kdebase 4. emerge -Dup world   Actual Results:   Step 2 tells one to upgrade the packages. Step 4 tells one to downgrade these very same packages.   Expected Results:   Option 1: not telling to downgrade these packages kdelibs and kdebase. Option 2: telling about dependency upon xorg-x11 version 6.8.0. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 12:03:09 UTC  ``` It's even more weird:  I installed xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 now and get this:  emerge -Dup world [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.0 [3.3.1] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.0 [3.3.1]  emerge -p kdelibs kdebase [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.1 [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.1  emerge -Dup kdelibs kdebase <empty>  It's all on the same machine, executed directly after each other.  I will not downgrade kdelibs nor kdebase.  It only annoys me for I don't like my package management system not properly resolving things.  bye  caspar ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 14:36:21 UTC  ``` emerge sync  then tell me if you still have the problem ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 16:41:39 UTC  ``` Yes, it's gone.  But is there an explanation for the behaviour of portage on this issue? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-12-01 10:36:58 UTC  ``` Yeah, was a ebuild version typo.  Fixed now. ``` |  |

# USN-4587-1: iTALC vulnerabilities

20 October 2020

Several security issues were fixed in iTALC.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [italc](/security/cves?package=italc) - didact tool which allows teachers to view and control computer labs

## Details

Nicolas Ruff discovered that iTALC had buffer overflows, divide-by-zero errors

and didn't check malloc return values. A remote attacker could use these issues

to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-6051](/security/CVE-2014-6051), [CVE-2014-6052](/security/CVE-2014-6052), [CVE-2014-6053](/security/CVE-2014-6053), [CVE-2014-6054](/security/CVE-2014-6054), [CVE-2014-6055](/security/CVE-2014-6055))

Josef Gajdusek discovered that iTALC had heap-based buffer overflow

vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9941](/security/CVE-2016-9941), [CVE-2016-9942](/security/CVE-2016-9942))

It was discovered that iTALC had an out-of-bounds write, multiple heap

out-of-bounds writes, an infinite loop, improper initializations, and null

pointer vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15127](/security/CVE-2018-15127),

[CVE-2018-20019](/security/CVE-2018-20019), [CVE-2018-20020](/security/CVE-2018-20020), [CVE-2018-20021](/security/CVE-2018-20021), [CVE-2018-20022](/security/CVE-2018-20022), [CVE-2018-20023](/security/CVE-2018-20023),

[CVE-2018-20024](/security/CVE-2018-20024), [CVE-2018-20748](/security/CVE-2018-20748), [CVE-2018-20749](/security/CVE-2018-20749), [CVE-2018-20750](/security/CVE-2018-20750), [CVE-2018-7225](/security/CVE-2018-7225),

[CVE-2019-15681](/security/CVE-2019-15681))

Debian Bug     : 916941

Kaspersky Lab discovered several vulnerabilities in libvncserver, a C
library to implement VNC server/client functionalities.

CVE-2018-6307

    a heap use-after-free vulnerability in the server code of the file
    transfer extension, which can result in remote code execution. This
    attack appears to be exploitable via network connectivity.

CVE-2018-15127

    contains a heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in the server code
    of the file transfer extension, which can result in remote code
    execution. This attack appears to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

CVE-2018-20019

    multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in VNC client code,
    which can result in remote code execution.

CVE-2018-20020

    heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in a structure in VNC client
    code, which can result in remote code execution.

CVE-2018-20021

    CWE-835: Infinite Loop vulnerability in VNC client code. The
    vulnerability could allow an attacker to consume an excessive amount
    of resources, such as CPU and RAM.

CVE-2018-20022

    CWE-665: Improper Initialization weaknesses in VNC client code,
    which could allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused
    for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it
    can be used to leak stack memory layout and bypass ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    Improper Initialization vulnerability in VNC Repeater client code,
    which could allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused
    for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it
    can be used to leak stack memory layout and bypass ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    a null pointer dereference in VNC client code, which can result in
    DoS.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.

Package        : italc
Version        : 1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6051 CVE-2014-6052 CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2014-6054
                 CVE-2014-6055 CVE-2016-9941 CVE-2016-9942 CVE-2018-6307

                 CVE-2019-15681

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of iTALC, a
classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

    Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
    a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

    The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
    LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
    allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
    screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
    PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
    a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
    (2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
    rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
    cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
    attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

    Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
    client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

    Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
    allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
    payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the tile
    dimensions.

CVE-2018-6307

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2018-15126

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-15127

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in server code
    of file transfer extension that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20749

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20750

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20019

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in
    VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20748

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c. The fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    LibVNC contained CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in
    VNC Repeater client code that allowed attacker to read stack memory
    and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
    vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout and in
    bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your italc packages.

Package        : ssvnc
Version        : 1.0.29-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20020 CVE-2018-20021 CVE-2018-20022 CVE-2018-20024
Debian Bug     : 945827

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of ssvnc, an
encryption-capable VNC client..

The vulnerabilities referenced below are issues that have originally been
reported against Debian source package libvncserver (which also ships the
libvncclient shared library). The ssvnc source package in Debian ships a
custom-patched, stripped down and outdated variant of libvncclient, thus
some of libvncclient's security fixes required porting over.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.29-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ssvnc packages.
