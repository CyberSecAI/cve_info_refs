Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the administrative linker functionality of Atlassian Crucible and Fisheye. Specifically, the `href` parameter within this functionality does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious HTML or JavaScript code can be injected via the `href` parameter, and this code is then stored within the application and executed when other users access the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data. They might also be able to manipulate the application's interface or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Account Compromise:** If an attacker can successfully inject malicious code into an administrative page, they could potentially compromise administrative accounts and gain full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript into the `href` parameter within the administrative linker functionality.
- The injected code is then stored by the application.
- When a user (including administrators) views the affected page or functionality, the stored malicious code is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
- **Access to Administrative Linker Functionality:** The attacker must have the ability to modify the `href` parameter through the administrative linker function. This is likely something only administrators can do.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Atlassian Crucible and Fisheye versions prior to 4.7.0.
- The severity is classified as "Low" by Atlassian.
- The fix for this issue is included in version 4.7.0.

In summary, CVE-2018-20240 is a stored XSS vulnerability within the administrative linker functionality of Atlassian Crucible and Fisheye. It can allow remote attackers to inject malicious code and potentially compromise user accounts or data.
