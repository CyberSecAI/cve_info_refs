Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20121

**Description:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Podcast Generator 2.7.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises due to a lack of proper input sanitization when adding a new category through the admin panel. Specifically, the `addcategory` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the application's database, and executed when a user views the affected page, causing the XSS payload to be triggered.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize or encode the `addcategory` parameter before storing it in the database, allowing injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they visit the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker may be able to alter the visual appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker submits a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable URL: `http://{DOMAIN}/{PATH-OF-PODCAST}/?p=admin&do=categories&action=add`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The malicious XSS payload is injected via the `addcategory` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Podcast Generator to add a new category. However, it is specified in the advisory that no prior authentication is required.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and the XSS injection technique.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the affected page where the stored XSS is executed.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable URL:** `http://{DOMAIN}/{PATH-OF-PODCAST}/?p=admin&do=categories&action=add`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `addcategory` (POST parameter)
