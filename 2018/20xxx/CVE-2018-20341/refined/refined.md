- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unquoted service paths in the registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Malicious code injection risk due to unquoted service paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to the execution of malicious code by hijacking the service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into a path used by a service if the path is not properly quoted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to modify the service paths in the registry.
