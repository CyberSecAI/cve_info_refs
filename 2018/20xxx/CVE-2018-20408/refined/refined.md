The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20408.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the `AP4_DescriptorFactory::CreateDescriptorFromStream` function within the Bento4 library. Specifically, when processing a crafted MP4 file, the function allocates memory for various descriptors but fails to deallocate them properly, leading to memory leaks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leaks in `Ap4DescriptorFactory.cpp` at line 89.
- Unfreed memory allocations in other parts of the code that are triggered when processing a crafted input, including in `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::Create` and `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion over time, which can lead to denial of service if the application continues to process crafted input.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted MP4 file using the `mp42hls` tool or the Bento4 library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious MP4 file to the `mp42hls` tool or any application that uses the vulnerable Bento4 library.

**Additional Technical Details:**
The provided ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output shows the exact locations where the memory leaks occur, specifying the functions and line numbers within the Bento4 source code. It identifies both direct and indirect leaks with specific byte sizes and object counts. The `crash3.zip` file (available from the included link) serves as a proof-of-concept.
