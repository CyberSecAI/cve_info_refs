Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the relevant information pertaining to CVE-2018-20173:

**1. Verification:**

The provided text mentions a fix for a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability:

   > *OpManager: A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability could be exploited by users with 'Write' access to the 'Deploy Agent' action in the UI. This has been fixed now. [Reported by Daniel Santos. Refer: CVE-2024-5466]*

However, **the CVE ID is incorrect** as it refers to CVE-2024-5466 and not CVE-2018-20173.  Therefore, the content is not directly relevant to CVE-2018-20173.

**2. Extracted Information (for the incorrect CVE-2024-5466):**

   - **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The root cause is a flaw within the 'Deploy Agent' functionality. Specifically, users with "Write" access can exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is present, meaning an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
   - **Impact of exploitation**: The impact of exploitation is severe, as an attacker can gain full control over the server by executing malicious code on it.
   - **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the 'Deploy Agent' action in the user interface.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have 'Write' access to the 'Deploy Agent' action within the OpManager UI. This implies that the attacker needs to have some level of authorized access to the system.

**Conclusion**

While the document provides information about a fixed RCE vulnerability, it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2018-20173.  The document is actually referencing a different CVE, CVE-2024-5466.
