Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents, focusing on CVE-2018-20217:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

*   The provided documents directly reference CVE-2018-20217, and describe it as a vulnerability in MIT Kerberos 5 that can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) handles S4U2Self (Service-for-User-to-Self) requests when the user has an expired password or requires a password change and uses an older encryption type such as DES, DES3 or RC4.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Password Attributes**: The KDC fails to ignore password expiration and password change requirements when processing S4U2Self requests using older encryption types. This discrepancy from Windows KDC behavior makes it susceptible to the exploit.
*   **Assertion Failure:** Specifically, an authenticated user with an older encryption type can cause an assertion failure in the KDC if their password has expired or needs to be changed and they make an S4U2Self request.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. This means that a malicious actor could render the Kerberos service unavailable.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, as the attacker interacts with the KDC via network requests.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Kerberos realm.
*   **Older Encryption Type:** The attacker must be able to obtain a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) using an older encryption type (DES, DES3, or RC4).
*   **Ability to Send S4U2Self Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send S4U2Self requests to the KDC.

**Additional Information From the Documents**

*   **NetApp Advisory**: NetApp identifies the vulnerability as affecting MIT Kerberos 5 versions before 1.17 and specifies that multiple NetApp products incorporate Kerberos, though none are listed as affected.
*  **NetApp's stance:** NetApp has stated that none of their products are vulnerable to this CVE.
*   **Fedora Update:**  A Fedora 29 update addresses the CVE by removing an incorrect KDC assertion.
*   **Debian LTS Advisory:** A Debian LTS advisory states the vulnerability is fixed in krb5 version 1.15-1+deb9u3 for Debian 9.
*   **MIT Commit:** The commit message from MIT indicates that the fix includes ignoring password expiration and "needchange" attributes, aligning the behavior with Windows KDCs, and treating ERR_KEY_EXP as confirmation that the client exists in the realm during AS requests for enterprise principals.

**Summary**

CVE-2018-20217 involves a flaw in the MIT Kerberos 5 KDC that allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition by sending a specially crafted S4U2Self request when specific authentication conditions are met such as using older encryption types and having an expired password. While NetApp explicitly states that their products are not affected, other sources indicate the vulnerability's presence in Kerberos implementations. The vulnerability requires an authenticated user with specific encryption and request capabilities to exploit.
