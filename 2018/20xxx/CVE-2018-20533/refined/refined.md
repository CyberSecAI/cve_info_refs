  "CVE-2018-20533": {
    "description": "There is a NULL pointer dereference at ext/testcase.c (function testcase_str2dep_complex) in libsolvext.a in libsolv through 0.7.2 that will cause a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `testcase_str2dep_complex` function due to a lack of proper null checks on input data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (application crash)",
      "attack_vector": "Network (though the vulnerable code is triggered in test suite. The network aspect comes from the fact that the vulnerability could be triggered by a user or automated system that was tricked into opening a specially crafted file.).",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input to trigger the null pointer dereference in a system that uses libsolv. This might occur from a user or system that is tricked into opening a malformed file."
