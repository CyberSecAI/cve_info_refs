- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when processing `applyOps` commands, specifically related to renaming collections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the target namespace during collection renaming operations within the `applyOps` command. This lack of validation leads to an invariant failure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user with database query privileges can trigger a denial of service (DoS) by crafting malicious `applyOps` invocations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `applyOps` command, which can be invoked by an authenticated user with database query privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to execute database queries, enabling them to call the `applyOps` command.
