### @m-r-r **[m-r-r](/m-r-r)** commented [Jun 19, 2015](#issue-89655852)

Hello

I noticed the ScanError struct did not implement the Error trait, so I've implemented it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Is it possible to backport this to 0.3.x series? According to crates.io stats, half of the recent downloads of rust-yaml are in the 0.3.x.  If this fix is already backported, please let me know and I'll update the [security advisory](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/master/crates/yaml-rust/RUSTSEC-2018-0006.toml). |

| [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) Most of the rust-yaml downloads are due to clap, which isn't really affected by this issue, making this mostly unimportant. |

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while
deserializing data structures.

This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with deeply nested structures
that causes an abort while deserializing it.

The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.

Note: `clap 2.33` is not affected by this because it uses `yaml-rust`
in a way that doesn't trigger the vulnerability. More specifically:

1. The input to the YAML parser is always trusted - is included at compile
   time via `include_str!`.
2. The nesting level is never deep enough to trigger the overflow in practice
   (at most 5).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
