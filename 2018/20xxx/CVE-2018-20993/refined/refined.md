{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against deep recursion during deserialization of YAML data structures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled recursion",
      "Lack of recursion depth check"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted YAML file with deeply nested structures. This leads to a program abort during deserialization.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (as data can be received over the network)",
      "YAML file input"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to supply a malicious YAML file to a program using the vulnerable yaml-rust library."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2018-20993",
   "description": "Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while deserializing data structures. This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with deeply nested structures that causes an abort while deserializing it. The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth."
