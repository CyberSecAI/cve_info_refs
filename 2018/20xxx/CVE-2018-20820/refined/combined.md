## Description

[![@hongxuchen](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/843267?u=f1bbd57b93aeb2ec77d51b126b7c8906356c67ad&v=4&size=48)](/hongxuchen)[hongxuchen](https://github.com/hongxuchen)opened [on Jul 17, 2018](https://github.com/dropbox/lepton/issues/111#issue-341744551)

We found with our fuzzer an interger overflow error inside `read_ujpg` from jpgcoder.cc when feeding lepton [3f6d98c](https://github.com/dropbox/lepton/commit/3f6d98c88bb104f10f6c3a676514491ac270c112) with a crafted lep file.

POC:

[https://github.com/ntu-sec/pocs/blob/master/lepton-3f6d98c/crashes/iof\_jpgcoder.cc:4160\_1.lep?raw=true](https://github.com/ntu-sec/pocs/blob/master/lepton-3f6d98c/crashes/iof_jpgcoder.cc%3A4160_1.lep?raw=true)

When running `lepton -unjailed $POC /tmp/test.jpg`, it output the messages:

```
lepton v1.0-1.2.1-171-g3f6d98c
START ACHIEVED 1531794366 328204
src/lepton/jpgcoder.cc:4160:83: runtime error: signed integer overflow: -1509949439 * 2 cannot be represented in type 'int'
Assert Failed: false && "Data not properly zlib coded" at (src/lepton/jpgcoder.cc:4162)

```

When running `lepton $POC /tmp/test.jpg`, it crashes with message like:

```
lepton v1.0-1.2.1-171-g3f6d98c
=================================================================
[1]    97197 invalid system call  ~/FOT/lepton/lepton ./hbo_inflate.c:1170_2.lep
