Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `lt_prediction` function in `libfaad/lt_predict.c` at line 108 of the FAAD2 library.
*   The issue stems from an invalid memory address dereference. This suggests the program is attempting to access memory that it shouldn't, which leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Memory Access:**  The core weakness is an attempt to dereference an invalid or null memory address. This is a classic programming error that can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The immediate impact is a crash of the FAAD2 decoder, leading to denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):**  The Debian Security Advisory and the Gentoo Security Advisory suggest that exploiting these vulnerabilities, including this one, could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if crafted MPEG AAC files are processed. This is not explicitly confirmed for this CVE alone, but it is implied that this vulnerability may be exploitable for ACE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Audio File:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file with the vulnerable FAAD2 decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious AAC file to be processed by a vulnerable version of FAAD2.
*   This vulnerability is exploitable both locally and remotely (as indicated by the Gentoo advisory), suggesting it could be triggered through a local file or a remote service using the library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub issue report includes a crash log with AddressSanitizer output, pinpointing the location of the issue.
*   The provided POC file link seems to be an AAC file which triggers the crash.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in FAAD2 version 2.9.0.
*   Several other CVEs are associated with faad2, indicating multiple vulnerabilities within the same package.
