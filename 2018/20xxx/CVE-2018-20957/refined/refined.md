Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary vulnerability stems from the insecure method used to derive the lock's authentication keys. The keys are derived from the lock's Bluetooth MAC address using an MD5 hash and substring operation. The BLE MAC address is broadcast by the lock, making it easily accessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Key Derivation:** The use of a publicly broadcasted BLE MAC address to derive the authentication keys makes the lock's security trivial to bypass. The MD5 hash, combined with substring operations, is not cryptographically secure and can easily be computed using the MAC address.
2.  **Lack of Transport Encryption:** The mobile application communicates with the Tapplock servers over HTTP, exposing the key exchange data.
3.  **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** The data sent to the lock over BLE during authentication is static and can be replayed to unlock the device. There is no rolling code or similar protection mechanism in place.
4.  **No Secure Revocation of Permissions:** Once a user shares the lock's access, the shared user receives the static unlocking data, making it impossible to revoke the shared user's access as they can always replay the data.
5.  **No Factory Reset:** The lock lacks a factory reset option. Deleting the lock from an account does not change the key data stored on the lock. This means an attacker can still unlock it even after the owner deletes the lock from their account.
6.  **Physical Weakness:** The shackle's design, while intended to prevent shimming, makes it vulnerable to bolt cutters, due to the step introduced in the shackle design.
7.  **Unencrypted BLE communication**: The vulnerability is that the lock can be unlocked using a replay attack, because the BLE data is not encrypted and static between connections.
8. **Lack of Authentication**: The lock uses AES-128 but in a manner that makes it insecure. The pairing, key exchange, key sharing, and most importantly, authentication are poorly implemented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can easily unlock any Tapplock within seconds using a mobile phone.
*   An attacker can intercept the data sent from the Tapplock to the server over HTTP, and unlock the lock by replaying the data,
*   An attacker can maintain unauthorized access even after the original owner attempts to revoke it.
*   The lock's physical security is also easily bypassed with basic bolt cutters.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **BLE Replay Attack:** An attacker can passively listen for BLE traffic, extract the necessary data to unlock the lock.
2.  **Network Sniffing:** An attacker can intercept HTTP traffic between the app and the server to obtain authentication data, which can be used to unlock the lock.
3.  **Physical Attack:** An attacker can use a simple bolt cutter to physically break the lock shackle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity to the Lock:** The attacker needs to be within BLE range of the lock to perform a replay attack.
*   **Network Access (for server sniffing):** The attacker would need to be able to intercept HTTP traffic between the Tapplock app and the Tapplock server.
*   **Basic Knowledge**: The attacker only needs basic knowledge of how BLE devices communicate and the capacity to run a python script (provided in the article).
*   **Mobile Device**: The attacker needs an application (either custom developed using the article information or the Android app developed by the researchers) or similar to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The security researcher disclosed the vulnerability to Tapplock with a 7-day window for response.
*   Tapplock was aware of the issues prior to the disclosure, and did not notify its customers.
*   Tapplock released a notice acknowledging the vulnerabilities after the disclosure was made public, but the notice was considered too little, too late.
* The article provides more technical details than the typical CVE description, including the specific code snippets used for key derivation.
