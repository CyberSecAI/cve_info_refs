[@awaisdar001](https://github.com/awaisdar001) [@yro](https://github.com/yro): This may be the only change that is strictly necessary. You may want to consider breaking this out into its own PR, and leaving all the other changes for follow-up (if necessary). The other changes may require more discussion as well.

:-)

and only `endorsedReason` is rendered here on this page, not `flag` or `recommender_title`. They need to be escaped at backend so that we do not store the data.

[@robrap](https://github.com/robrap) Can you review and verify the fix on the sandbox?

Approval is dependent on creating a follow-up Discovery ticket.

For the follow-up ticket:

1. This XBlock is marked as deprecated, so by that token, we should not invest in it and we should delete it. Can we do this and follow the full deprecation process?
2. If we do not delete this XBlock and we continue to use it, do we need to drop the deprecated designation and do follow-up to actually support it:

   a. add unit tests and quality tests

   b. re-review the fixes with `HtmlUtils`, and potentially use `ensureHtml` and drop the use of `HtmlUtils.HTML` in certain cases. We may also need to pass data from back-end to front-end differently.
