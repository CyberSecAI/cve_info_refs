The provided content relates to a fix for a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `RecommenderXBlock` component.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stemmed from the improper handling of user-provided data, specifically in the `resourcebox.html` template, where the `endorsedReason` parameter was not being escaped before being rendered, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected content. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the `endorsedReason` field. This data is then stored and rendered to other users on the application interface, triggering the XSS payload when displayed on the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to inject data into the `endorsedReason` field.

The fix involves adding `expression_filter="h"` to the `<%page>` directive in the `resourcebox.html` template, which ensures that the template variables are HTML-escaped before being rendered, preventing XSS attacks.
