The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4, but it does not mention CVE-2018-20794. Therefore, the content is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE.

However, the content does describe the following vulnerabilities in Responsive FileManager 9.13.4:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary file read via path traversal:**
    *   **Root cause:**  Inadequate input sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` with the `get_file` action.
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Impact:**  Reading sensitive files from the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php` with a crafted `path` parameter.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:**  Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

2.  **Arbitrary file read via path traversal (copy/cut and paste):**
    *   **Root cause:** Inadequate input sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` with the `copy_cut` action and `execute.php` with the `paste_clipboard` action
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing access to files outside the intended directory by first copying them and then pasting them within the webroot.
    *   **Impact:** Reading sensitive files from the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php` to copy the target file, then sending a POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php` to paste it, finally accessing it at the web root.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

3.  **Arbitrary file write via path traversal bypass:**
    *   **Root cause:** Vulnerability in the directory traversal mitigation when handling the `create_file` action in `execute.php`. Mitigation bypass using an array format for the parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass.
    *   **Impact:** Writing arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php` with crafted `paths` and `names` parameters in an array format.
    *    **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

4.  **Arbitrary file deletion via path traversal bypass:**
    *   **Root cause:** Vulnerability in the directory traversal mitigation when handling the `delete_file` action in `execute.php`. Mitigation bypass using an array format for the parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass.
    *   **Impact:** Deleting arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing denial of service or disrupting application functionality.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php` with a crafted `paths` parameter in an array format.
     *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

5. **Arbitrary directory deletion via path traversal bypass:**
    * **Root cause:** Vulnerability in the directory traversal mitigation when handling the `delete_folder` action in `execute.php`. Mitigation bypass using an array format for the parameters.
    * **Weakness:** Path traversal bypass.
    * **Impact:** Deleting arbitrary directories on the server, potentially causing denial of service or disrupting application functionality.
    * **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/execute.php` with a crafted `paths` parameter in an array format.
    * **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

6.  **Arbitrary file write (limited extension) via path traversal:**
    *   **Root cause:** Inadequate input sanitization of the `path` parameter in `ajax_calls.php` with the `save_img` action. Vulnerable to path traversal. The file extension is limited to jpg/jpeg/png.
    *   **Weakness:** Path traversal vulnerability, allowing writing of arbitrary image files.
    *   **Impact:** Writing arbitrary files to the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a POST request to `/filemanager/ajax_calls.php` with a crafted `path`, `name` and `url` parameter.
     *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

7.  **Persistent XSS in media preview:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improper handling of file names when previewing media files in `media_preview` action.
    *  **Weakness:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
    *   **Attack vector:** Uploading a file with a malicious payload in the name, which is then executed when previewed.
    *    **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to upload files to the server, and a user that accesses the preview functionality.
