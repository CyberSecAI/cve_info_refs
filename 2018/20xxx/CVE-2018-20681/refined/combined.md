## Description

mate-screensaver before 1.20.2 in MATE Desktop Environment allows physically proximate attackers to view screen content and possibly control applications. By unplugging and re-plugging or power-cycling external output devices (such as additionally attached graphical outputs via HDMI, VGA, DVI, etc.) the content of a screensaver-locked session can be revealed. In some scenarios, the attacker can execute applications, such as by clicking with a mouse.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@fizzfaldt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2748321?v=4&size=48)](/fizzfaldt)[fizzfaldt](https://github.com/fizzfaldt)opened [on May 1, 2018](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/155#issue-319321909)
#### Expected behaviour

Lock Screen

Turn off monitor (either by power management putting it to sleep, or by pressing power button)

Turn monitor on

Start typing

Expect to see lock screen on monitor

#### Actual behaviour

Lock Screen

Turn off monitor

Turn monitor on

Start typing

Expect to see lock screen on monitor

#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

```
adddate() {
   while IFS= read -r line; do
      echo "$(date) $line"
   done
}
killall mate-screensaver
mate-screensaver --no-daemon --debug 2>&1 \
  | adddate  > screen.log

```

Wait 60 seconds

Lock screen (I used Window manager shortcut)

Wait 60 seconds

Power off monitor (soft off)

Wait 60 seconds

Power on monitor

Wait 9 seconds (that's how long it takes monitor to boot)

Can see and use screen/type/etc; it is (effectively) unlocked.

Notes/logs:

`mate-screensaver-command -q` reports:

* after `killall mate-screensaver`:
  + `Screensaver is not running!`
* After re-running mate-screensaver:
  + `The screensaver is inactive`
  + `The screensaver is not inhibited`
* After locking (stays this way forever even while using the computer)
  + `The screensaver is active`
  + `The screensaver is not inhibited`

Same as above, annotated with logs: (attached for ease of reading)

`mate-screensaver --no-daemon --debug`

[mate-screensaver-1.txt](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/files/1965111/mate-screensaver-1.txt)

[mate-screensaver-2.txt](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/files/1965114/mate-screensaver-2.txt)

Wait 60 seconds

[mate-screensaver-4.txt](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/files/1965121/mate-screensaver-4.txt)

[dmesg-4.txt](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/files/1965125/dmesg-4.txt)

Wait 9 seconds (that's how long it takes monitor to boot)

Can see and use screen/type/etc; it is (effectively) unlocked.

[dmesg-5.txt](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/files/1965126/dmesg-5.txt)

(there is no dmesg-1.txt or dmesg-2.txt or mate-screensaver-5.txt (blank during that time))

#### Troubleshooting

This occurred on two machines.

* Home Machine
  + Problem occurred on Ubuntu 16.04 (do not have logs unfortunately)
  + Unsure what version of mate it was at the time
  + If relevant
    - monitor was 2560x1600
    - Uses nvidia drivers
  + ~~Upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04 (which upgraded mate to 1.20.0) fixed the problem on home machine.~~
    - Upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04 on home machine merely made the problem stop when I manually power off the monitor, but if it powers off due to inactivity the problem still occurs.
* Work Machine
  + Problem occurred on Ubuntu 17.10 (mate 1.18) (do not have logs unfortunately)
  + Upgrading to Ubuntu 18.04 (mate 1.20.0) did NOT fix the problem.
  + If relevant
    - monitor is 3840x2160
    - Problem still occurs if I switch to different resolution
    - Has no dedicated video card/using intel onboard graphics
    - monitor is a USB hub.. problem still reproduces if I disconnect the usb cable and have the keyboard connected some other way.

Please let me know what other logs/steps may be useful.

#### MATE general version

1.20.0

#### Package version

mate-screensaver 1.20.0-1

[![@qth](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6684388?u=131366ff39e62764b9b6749df419e09322cf7bd4&v=4&size=48)](/qth)[qth](https://github.com/qth)opened [on Apr 10, 2018](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/152#issue-313066344)
#### Expected behaviour

mate-screensaver should keep the user's session locked until valid authentication has taken place (password entered, etc.)

#### Actual behaviour & steps to reproduce the behaviour

Do the following:

1. Have two display-port attached displays on a fresh install of Fedora 27. Mine are in ports 3 & 4, in case that makes any difference. Login to MATE.
2. Press ctrl-alt-L or allow the screensaver timeout to lock the screen.

3.a. Bump the mouse or type a key on the keyboard before the displays have either been placed into power save mode or put to sleep:

< MATE presents the password prompt and the user's windows remain hidden until the password has been correctly entered. >

3.b. Bump the mouse or type a key on the keyboard after the displays have been put into power save mode, but before they have been put to sleep:

< MATE presents the unlock with password prompt, but displays (doesn't hide) the windows of your desktop. You cannot interact with the applications or windows until the password has been correctly entered, but the content is plainly visible as described by other users in this bug. >

3.c. Bump the mouse to type a key on the keyboard after the displays have been put to sleep:

< MATE blanks one display where the password dialog box would have been, the other is available for interaction WITHOUT having entered in the correct password. New applications can be launched, all applications may be used with the same privilege level of the user who had previously logged in and believed that their desktop was locked. >

While I could not duplicate [#155](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/issues/155) with lightdm and GTK 3.23(Lightdm probable issue as I get no unlocking dialog), this built fine and showed the screensaver images same as before. Unfortunately that was all I was able to test successfully, even on a new session startup

This works well, lockscreen can't be by-passed any more and HIDPI support works well.

Tested with:

1. workstation with 2 external monitors (HIDPI at display port + non-HIDPI at hdmi port)
2. noteboook with 1 external monitor at hdmi port

Thanks for your work, please claim the bounty which will help a bit to replace your damaged hardware.

We need your expertise for fixing bugs.

This is a by-hand application of
https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver/pull/167. It cannot be
done automatically because the two codebases are quite diverged at this
point.

The idea is that instead of listening to the `monitor-changed` on
GdkScreen, we listen for the `monitor-added` and `monitor-removed`
signals on GdkDisplay, making dynamic monitor changes more reliable.
