The vulnerability is caused by systemd's mishandling of VT keyboard modes during logouts, which can lead to cleartext password exposure. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by observing VT1 during logouts, shutdown, or through VT toggling. NetApp indicates that multiple products that incorporate systemd are vulnerable and the identified NetApp products and a mitigation are specified in the provided text."
