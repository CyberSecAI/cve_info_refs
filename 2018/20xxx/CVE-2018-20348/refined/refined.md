    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-20348",
    "github_advisory_link": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8pp8-7wvw-f67f",
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to a stack overflow in the `libpff_item_tree_create_node` function within `libpff_item_tree.c` when processing a crafted file. This is related to the `libfdata_tree_get_node_value` function in `libfdata_tree.c`.",
    "affected_versions": "Versions prior to experimental-20180714 of libpff",
    "root_cause": "The `libpff_item_tree_create_node` function recursively calls itself, leading to a stack overflow when processing a crafted input file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-835"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to infinite recursion and stack overflow.",
    "attack_vector": "Local. The attacker must provide a specially crafted file to the vulnerable application.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PFF file, meaning they would either need local access to the machine or be able to convince a user to open such a file.",
    "cvss": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",
    "epss_score": "0.054%",
     "additional_details": "The issue was reported by Zhao Liang of Huawei Weiran Labs, and the vulnerability can be triggered by executing `pffexport` with a crafted PFF file. The analysis of the vulnerability was initially incomplete and misleading according to the maintainer of libpff."
