Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the authentication process of the CMS application, specifically within the `Administrator/index.php` and `user/index.php` files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application was vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries in the login functionality. This allowed attackers to manipulate SQL queries used for authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: Attackers could bypass the login authentication process for both regular user and administrator accounts, potentially logging in as any user without needing to know the correct password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SQL input: The attacker manipulates the input fields of the login form to inject SQL code. The injected SQL is then executed against the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the CMS application. They need to have basic knowledge of SQL injection. No other specific access or privilege is mentioned or implied.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented was the addition of `mysqli_real_escape_string` to sanitize user input before being used in SQL queries.
- While the fix addresses the immediate threat, the contributor recommends using prepared statements as a more secure and future-proof solution against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The submitter of the fix planned on requesting a CVE for this bug, which is consistent with the CVE provided here.
