The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in Swann and FLIR/Lorex home security cameras, focusing on issues with the Ozvision cloud service. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Video Feed Switching Vulnerability (Most Relevant to the CVE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary identifier for cameras within the Ozvision platform is the serial number. The API lacked proper authorization checks, allowing manipulation of the device serial number in API requests.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization checks on the API, relying solely on the serial number for identification and access control. The `userListAssets` endpoint returns device information, which can be tampered with by modifying the deviceid.  The `deviceWakeup` request also uses the same modifiable serial.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can switch video feeds from one camera to another, gaining arbitrary access to live camera feeds.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker intercepts and modifies API requests (e.g. using tools like Charles, Burp, or MITMProxy). The attacker changes the serial number in the request to that of a different camera.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the mobile app and the Ozvision cloud service. They need a valid account to make a request for `userListAssets`, but then can modify the device ID to access other cameras.
*   **Additional Detail:**
    *   Serial numbers can be enumerated by using the `1.1/osn/AccountAddDevice` API endpoint, as it throws an error if the device is already paired. This allowed them to identify valid device IDs.
    *   The attack works by modifying the device ID in the API response, causing the mobile app to then use the modified ID to make requests.

**2. Wi-Fi PSK Exposure via De-authentication (Less Relevant, Unreliable)**

*   **Root Cause:** Intermittent issue during de-authentication over Wi-Fi, sometimes forcing the camera into access point mode and exposing the Wi-Fi PSK.
*   **Weakness:** Unstable de-authentication process resulting in an unsafe state and exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can recover the Wi-Fi PSK, potentially gaining access to the home network.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering the de-authentication process.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be nearby and able to deauthenticate the camera.
*   **Additional Detail:** This vulnerability was unreliable and could not be consistently replicated. It affected only one of the tested cameras on older firmware.

**3. PSK Persistence in Logs After Factory Reset**

*   **Root Cause:** Factory reset does not remove the Wi-Fi PSK from device logs.
*   **Weakness:** Failure to sanitize device logs after a factory reset.  While `wpa_supplicant.conf` is overwritten, logs still hold the PSK.
*   **Impact:** After factory reset, an attacker could connect to the camera's soft AP, recover the PSK from the logs, and gain access to the user's Wi-Fi network.
*   **Attack Vector:** Physical access to the camera to perform a factory reset. Then, connecting to the camera via it's soft AP mode.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs physical access to the camera.
*   **Additional Detail:** The device logs can be accessed by anyone connecting to the camera when it's in soft AP mode.

**4. Root FTP Shell with Weak Password**

*   **Root Cause:** The camera's firmware has an FTP service with a hardcoded root password using a weak hashing algorithm (MD5Crypt).
*   **Weakness:** Use of a weak hashing algorithm and a default password, allowing easy cracking.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains root access to the device and can push rogue firmware.
*   **Attack Vector:** Connecting to the camera's soft AP and then connecting to the FTP server on the device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the camera while it is in its soft AP mode. The password can easily be cracked using dictionary or rainbow table attacks.
*   **Additional Detail:**  The squashfs filesystem contained the `/etc/shadow` file, which had the weak password hash.

**In Summary**

The core vulnerability (video feed switching) stems from inadequate authorization in the Ozvision cloud service's API. By manipulating the serial number used as the primary identifier, attackers can access other people's live camera feeds. The other vulnerabilities highlight issues with the camera's local security, with PSK exposure, and root access via a weak password.
