{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `mxml_write_node` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted XML files with specific content triggering the vulnerability in the `mxml_write_node` function during parsing."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to supply a crafted XML file to an application using the vulnerable mxml library, specifically triggering the code path involving double-precision floating point numbers.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a double-precision floating point number in the `mxml_write_node` function. The provided ASAN output shows a stack buffer overflow detected during a `sprintf` call within `mxml_write_node`."
