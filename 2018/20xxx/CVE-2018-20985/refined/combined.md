This is a GREAT app and Richard gives A++ support. I highly recommend looking at his paid apps for integration with Payeezy. He’s made my life 100% easier!

### [Plugin helped me help a client with First Data](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-helped-me-help-a-client-with-first-data/)

This plugin was critical for me to help a client integrate with first data. Frist data provided limited support with integrating with their merchant services. WP Payeezy Pay and WP Payeezy Results plugns saved me from all the hardwork and headache. Also the support for this application was very responsive.
