# Arbitrary File read in Gitlab project import with Git LFS

**[HackerOne report #460423](https://hackerone.com/reports/460423)** by nyangawa on 2018-12-11:

**Summary:**
An invalid check in "project import by URL" feature allows an attacker to read arbitrary file in Gitlab server.

**Description:**
The following code in `app/services/projects/lfs_pointers/lfs_download_service.rb` doesn't really sanitize an URL and enforce it to begin with white-listed schemes (defined in `lib/gitlab/url_sanitizer.rb`)

```
sanitized_uri = Gitlab::UrlSanitizer.new(url)
```

Therefore, a string like '/etc/passwd' could easily pass this sanitizer and get into `download_and_save_file`, which finally allows the content of `/etc/passwd` file be downloadable from the Gitlab server.

## Steps To Reproduce:

(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

1. Import project (git repo by URL) from <http://jp.nyangawa.me:4567/p1> (my PoC git server)
2. After the import process finishes successfully, download the file `1m` in the imported repo.

## Supporting Material/References:

I've validated this issue both in my own Gitlab instance and Gitlab.com.

You can verify `https://gitlab.com/Nyangawa/p1/blob/master/1m` directly or try to reproduce the bug following the steps in the previous section.

I can push the PoC server to a private repository on Gitlab.com if you ask. Please tell me your considerations.

## Impact

The ability to read arbitrary file in a Gitlab instance could lead to serious data breach and other problems.
