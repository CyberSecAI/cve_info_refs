Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20483:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly mentions **CVE-2018-20483** in multiple places, including the Red Hat Bugzilla entry, the NetApp advisory, and the Gentoo Security Advisory.
*   The description in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry and the NetApp advisory both align with the official CVE description: "wget: Information exposure in set_file_metadata function in xattr.c".
*   The bug report in Bugzilla explicitly discusses wget caching credentials in extended attributes, and how this could lead to information disclosure.
* The Red Hat Security Advisory also confirms that this CVE has to do with wget.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `set_file_metadata` function in the `xattr.c` file of GNU Wget.
*   This function stores a file's origin URL, including potentially sensitive information like credentials, in the extended attributes (specifically, `user.xdg.origin.url`) of downloaded files.
*   The vulnerability is similar to a flaw in curl's `fwrite_xattr`, where metadata is stored in the extended file attributes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Sensitive data, including usernames and passwords embedded in URLs, is being stored in file metadata.
*   **Insecure storage:** The storing of the URL, including username and password, in extended file attributes, makes this information easily accessible using utilities like `getfattr`.
*   The vulnerability is due to the storage of sensitive URL information in the `user.xdg.origin.url` and `user.xdg.referrer.url` extended attributes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Local users can retrieve the stored URL and referrer information, including potentially embedded credentials, by reading the extended attributes of downloaded files using utilities like `getfattr`. This exposes credentials that should be kept secret.
*   The impact is rated as **MEDIUM** severity with a CVSS score of 5.5.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the downloaded files. A local user can use file attribute utilities to expose the sensitive data.
*   **File System Access:** An attacker needs read access to the downloaded files' extended attributes.
* The vulnerability is present in the way wget caches credentials that are passed as a part of URL in the extended attributes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `wget` is used to download files.
*   **Read Access:** The attacker must have read permissions on the file system to access the extended attributes of downloaded files.
* No specialized network access is required.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The content indicates that the issue was introduced in wget version 1.19 with commit a933bdd31eee9c956a3b5cc142f004ef1fa94cb3 which added support for extended attributes.
*   Credentials passed via command-line options (`--user` / `--password` or `--user` / `--ask-password`) are not cached in extended attributes.
*   The `--no-xattr` command-line flag could be used as a workaround to disable saving metadata to extended attributes prior to the fix.
* The fix applied by upstream: 1. Changed the default behavior to `--no-xattr`, with `--xattr` to enable it 2. By default no username/passwords are not saved in the file extended attributes.
*   `curl` has a similar issue, but extended attributes are disabled by default and must be enabled with the `--xattr` option.
*   NetApp identified that the vulnerability is present in their SolidFire & HCI Management Node and a patch was provided.

In summary, CVE-2018-20483 involves a vulnerability in GNU Wget where sensitive URL information, including potentially embedded credentials, is stored in extended file attributes, making it accessible to local users who can read file metadata.
