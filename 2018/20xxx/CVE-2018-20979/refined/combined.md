### [Simple Contact Form](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-contact-form-13/)

I’ve been using Contact Form 7 for years, and it’s undoubtedly one of the most reliable and versatile plugins for creating contact forms. Its simplicity, compatibility, and lightweight nature make it an excellent choice for WordPress users. The ease of customization and integration with other tools is impressive, and it has served my websites flawlessly.
That said, I’d love to see a few enhancements to make this plugin even better. Adding a built-in date and calendar feature would simplify creating forms for bookings or appointments. Improving dropdown menu styling options would also be a great touch to enhance form aesthetics. Overall, this plugin remains a must-have for any WordPress site, and I look forward to seeing its future updates!

Why it’s unusable? This plugin was working so fine. Customize it it’s a nightmare!

Overhyped plugin simply because it is free. It is the ultimate barebones of a plugin that people find necessary. There are no features, customizing anything means you are either a) a programmer or b) have to email support (in which case good luck getting help, egos too big). Gets no updates, no features, no accessibility or UX improvements. You’re better off paying for a plugin than pulling your hair out to get it working as needed.

The team is highly responsive and helpful. They arranged a Google Meet session to assist me with an API and JSON data format issue, thoroughly resolving the problem on my end.
