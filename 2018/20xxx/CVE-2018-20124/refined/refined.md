Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20124:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the QEMU's RDMA backend implementation, specifically in the `build_host_sge_array()` routine.
- The code does not properly check if the number of scatter/gather elements (`num_sge`) provided by a guest exceeds the maximum allowed value `MAX_SGE`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write/read:** When `num_sge` exceeds `MAX_SGE` (which is 4), the code attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the `ibv_sge` array on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process can trigger the out-of-bounds access, causing the QEMU process to crash. This leads to a denial of service for the virtual machine.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code." This suggests that, under specific conditions, the memory corruption caused by the OOB access could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, although the provided content does not fully confirm it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Guest-to-host:** A malicious guest user/process can exploit this vulnerability by sending a 'PvrdmaSqWqe' ring element with `num_sge` set to a value greater than `MAX_SGE`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have control over a guest virtual machine using the vulnerable RDMA backend in QEMU.
- The attacker needs the ability to send or influence the 'PvrdmaSqWqe' ring element's content within the virtual machine, specifically the 'num_sge' field.
