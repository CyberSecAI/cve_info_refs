Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20105

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The yast2-rmt tool was logging the CA private key passphrase in clear text in the `/var/log/YaST2/y2log` file. This occurred when setting up an RMT server using `yast2-rmt` and providing a password to encrypt the CA private key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Log Files:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the CA private key passphrase in the log file. This is a clear violation of security best practices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker with access to the log file could obtain the CA private key passphrase.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:**  The exposed passphrase could potentially be used to compromise the RMT server if the CA key is used for authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the system where the yast2-rmt tool was used and to the log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the yast2-rmt tool was used to configure the RMT server.
- The attacker needs to be able to read the contents of `/var/log/YaST2/y2log` or related log files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" severity.
- The issue was fixed in yast2-rmt version 1.2.2 and later.
- Multiple security updates were released to address this issue across various SUSE and openSUSE products.
- The fix involves preventing the passphrase from being logged in clear text.
- CVSS v2 scores: AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N (Base Score 2.1)
- CVSS v3 scores: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (Base Score 5.5) / SUSE score: 4.4 CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
