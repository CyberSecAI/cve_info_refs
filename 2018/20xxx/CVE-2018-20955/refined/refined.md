Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities discovered:

**1. Arbitrary Camera Access via Serial Number Manipulation**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary identifier for the camera on the platform (both Swann's API and OzVision peer-to-peer tunnel) is the serial number, which is easily obtainable from the mobile app. The API did not properly authorize access based on the user's account but rather on the supplied device ID (serial number).
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient authorization checks on API endpoints allowing manipulation of device serial numbers.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could switch video feeds from one camera to another, gaining access to arbitrary cameras' live feeds.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Intercept and modify the API response containing the list of devices associated with the user's account (userListAssets).
    2.  Replace the legitimate serial number (deviceid) with another target's serial number.
    3.  Trigger 'play' in the app, which sends a 'deviceWakeup' request using the modified serial, then establishes a peer-to-peer tunnel to the device using the modified serial.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the mobile app and the server (using tools like Charles, Burp, or MITMproxy). Requires knowledge or ability to obtain a valid serial number.
*   **Additional Detail:** The article details how the API endpoint `deviceIsOwned` or `AccountAddDevice` could be used to enumerate valid serial numbers by checking if the camera is already paired, potentially allowing enumeration of the entire keyspace in a few days.

**2. Wi-Fi PSK Recovery via Camera Reset**

*   **Root Cause:**  A specific firmware version of the camera (not affecting all cameras tested) does not properly remove the PSK from device logs after a factory reset.
*  **Weakness:**  Sensitive information (Wi-Fi PSK) is left in device logs after a factory reset.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain the Wi-Fi PSK and join the network.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  De-authenticate the camera over Wi-Fi, which in some cases may cause the camera to reset and enter access point mode.
    2.  Connect to the camera's soft access point without a PSK,
    3.  Retrieve the Wi-Fi PSK from the device logs.
    4. Join the target's Wi-Fi network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Physical access to the camera to de-authenticate it and trigger the AP mode. Ability to connect to the camera's soft AP and access logs.
*   **Note:** The reliability of this attack is low and is not consistently reproducible.

**3. Root FTP Shell and Persistence**

*   **Root Cause:** The firmware update file on the camera contains an /etc/shadow file with a root password that is weakly hashed using MD5Crypt, which can be cracked relatively easily.
*  **Weakness:** Weakly hashed root password within the device firmware image and open FTP service.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain root access to the camera, potentially allowing for persistent access, firmware modification, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Connect to the camera's soft AP.
    2.  Access the FTP service and download the firmware update file.
    3.  Extract the /etc/shadow file from the firmware.
    4.  Crack the password hash using a tool like John the Ripper.
    5.  Use the password to gain root FTP shell access to the device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the camera on the local network (soft AP mode after reset). Ability to perform a password cracking attack.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The most significant issue is the authorization bypass allowing unauthorized access to video feeds by manipulating serial numbers.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The PSK being left in the logs after factory reset and the insecure password hashing exposed sensitive information.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The weak root password and open FTP service provide a pathway to persistent remote code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The cloud service provider, Ozvision, appears to have been aware of similar issues for an extended period before taking action.
*   Swann was responsive to the reported vulnerabilities and addressed them quickly once aware.
*   The vulnerabilities were also found in FLIR-FX/Lorex cameras, suggesting a systemic problem with Ozvisionâ€™s cloud service.
*   The article suggests that even after the initial fix for serial number switching, a further issue was found (audible click on rogue wakeup request, potentially used for battery drain).
