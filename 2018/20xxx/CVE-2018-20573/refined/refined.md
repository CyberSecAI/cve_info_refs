The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20573.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `Scanner::EnsureTokensInQueue()` function of the yaml-cpp library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `Scanner::EnsureTokensInQueue()` function enters an infinite recursion when processing a crafted YAML input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a stack overflow, leading to a crash of the application parsing the malicious YAML file. This can lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted YAML file. The provided PoC file `crash2.txt` can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted YAML file to a system that parses it using the vulnerable yaml-cpp library.
