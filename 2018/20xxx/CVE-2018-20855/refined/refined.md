Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20855:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The commit message from `cdn.kernel.org` includes the line:
> Fixes: 41d902cb7c32 ("RDMA/mlx5: Fix definition of mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp")

The description from `lists.opensuse.org` states:
> - CVE-2018-20855: In create\_qp\_common in drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/qp.c, mlx5\_ib\_create\_qp\_resp was never initialized, resulting in a leak of stack memory to userspace (bnc#1143045).

The commit from `git.kernel.org` is titled:
> IB/mlx5: Fix leaking stack memory to userspace

These descriptions directly match the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-20855, confirming that the provided content is relevant.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp` structure, which is used as a response buffer during the creation of RDMA Queue Pairs (QPs), was not being initialized before being populated, leading to uninitialized stack memory being exposed to userspace. Specifically, the structure is allocated on the stack and not explicitly zeroed out, leading to potential information disclosure.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Uninitialized stack memory was being copied into the `mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp` structure, which is then exposed to userspace.
    *   **Lack of Initialization:** The `mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp` structure was not explicitly initialized before being used, violating the principle of least surprise.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially read sensitive data present on the kernel stack by exploiting this flaw. The data leaked would be present on the stack, and thus could contain information from the stack frame of the `create_qp_common` function or any previous functions that used the same stack location.
    *   **Limited Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability doesn't provide privilege escalation by itself, the leaked data might contain sensitive information that could be leveraged to perform further attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker who can call the `create_qp_common` function, likely through the RDMA API.
    *   The vulnerability exists within the kernel's RDMA/mlx5 driver.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would require a valid user account and the ability to interact with the infiniband subsystem, which may involve opening a device node or making certain syscalls.
    *   Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The fix initializes the `mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp` structure with `{}` which sets all fields to zero.
*   The SUSE advisory confirms that the issue results in a leak of stack memory to userspace. It also notes that the affected component is located in `drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx5/qp.c`.

In summary, CVE-2018-20855 is an information leak vulnerability due to a lack of proper initialization of the `mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp` structure, where stack memory was being leaked to userspace. The fix involved explicit initialization of the structure to clear out sensitive data. The issue impacts local users who can make calls to the infiniband system, potentially exposing them to sensitive kernel information.
