The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20305.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi` handler of the D-Link DIR-816 A2 router firmware. The vulnerability occurs when processing the 'password' parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The router's firmware does not properly check the length of the password parameter received via POST requests after it is base64 decoded, causing it to write past the boundary of the allocated stack buffer.
- Lack of input validation: The firmware lacks proper input validation on the password parameter, especially regarding the length of the decoded data.
- Inconsistent length limits: The frontend imposes a password length limit, but this is not enforced on the backend during POST submissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary remote code execution: By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and gain control of the program execution flow, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Full control over the device: Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the vulnerable device.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi` endpoint, with an excessively long base64 encoded 'password' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, meaning an attacker doesn't need to have prior access or credentials to target the device.
