Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `sort[hostname]` parameter in the `ajax_table.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `sort[hostname]` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, device information, and other critical system details.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database, disrupting operations or leading to incorrect information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database privileges, an attacker might gain access to the underlying operating system or other parts of the infrastructure.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting malicious SQL, an attacker could crash the database or cause resource exhaustion, leading to service unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `ajax_table.php` endpoint.
- **`sort[hostname]` Parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is embedded within the `sort[hostname]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable LibreNMS instance, typically requiring network access to the web server hosting the application.
- **Authentication (Low Privilege):** The vulnerability can be exploited by a low privilege user, as stated in the CERT ENEA advisory "CVSS(3): 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)" which indicates a low privilege is required.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and function of the `sort[hostname]` parameter in the `ajax_table.php` file, and its injection point.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes examples of SQL injection payloads that demonstrate boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The advisory confirms that the issue was fixed in LibreNMS version 1.48 released on January 28, 2019.
- The github content confirms the vulnerability was patched in commit `32f72bc1ab7e980e4070e826a89d0d36a5ba62dd`  "Fix SQL injections in ajax_table.php" on Jul 10, 2020, which additionally mentions that other SQL injections existed via `searchPhrase` and `address` parameters in the same `ajax_table.php` file.
