The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20456.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-buffer-overflow in the `r_strbuf_setbin` function. This function is used when assembling x86 instructions using the `rasm2` tool in radare2. Specifically, the issue occurs when parsing complex memory operands with multiple registers, leading to writing beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-buffer-overflow in `r_strbuf_setbin`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the `rasm2` tool due to the stack buffer overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled to overwrite return addresses on the stack.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a specific x86 assembly instruction with a complex memory operand including multiple registers and offsets. The provided examples demonstrate the faulty instructions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious assembly instruction to the `rasm2` tool. This could be through command-line input, a script, or some other means of providing the instruction to the vulnerable parser.
