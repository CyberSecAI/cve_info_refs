## Description

[![@GriffinMB](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6545494?u=2e81cb55e2ca70d8f1ae2b02d1531a88866026da&v=4&size=48)](/GriffinMB)[GriffinMB](https://github.com/GriffinMB)opened [on Aug 22, 2017](https://github.com/smpallen99/coherence/issues/270#issue-252005211)

Thanks again for taking the time to talk with me. I'm opening an issue as per our conversation:

The Coherence library has "Mass Assignment"-like vulnerabilities. In particular, "registration"

endpoints (like creating, editing, updating), allow users to update any `coherence_fields`. This

means that, among other issues, users can automatically confirm their accounts by sending the `confirmed_at` parameter with their registration request. Further, the library design and documentation encourages insecure functionality by default.

For example:

* The "store" demo allows registering users to add themselves as admin:

  <https://github.com/smpallen99/store/blob/master/web/models/coherence/user.ex>

Due to these issues, I would consider officially "retiring" the current version of Coherence in hex.
