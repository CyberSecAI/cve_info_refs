{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Coherence library allows users to update any `coherence_fields` during registration, editing, or updating actions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Mass Assignment-like vulnerability where users can manipulate fields not intended for modification.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users can bypass security measures, such as automatically confirming their accounts by setting the `confirmed_at` parameter, and potentially elevating their privileges, such as adding themselves as admin.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating registration, edit, or update requests by including arbitrary `coherence_fields` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to make registration, edit, or update requests to the application using the vulnerable Coherence library."
