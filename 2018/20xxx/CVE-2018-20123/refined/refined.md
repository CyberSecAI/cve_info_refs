Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20123:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the QEMU's initialization process for the VMWare paravirtual RDMA (PVRDMA) device. Specifically, in the `pvrdma_realize()` function, if an error occurs during device initialization, the allocated memory resources for various objects are not properly released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak due to improper resource cleanup after an error during device initialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process can exploit this flaw to leak host memory. Continued exploitation can lead to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing a denial of service on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest User/Process:** The attack vector involves a malicious user or process running within the guest virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within the guest OS to trigger the flawed initialization process.

**Technical Details:**
- The `pvrdma_realize()` routine in `hw/rdma/vmw/pvrdma_main.c` does not free the allocated memory upon encountering an error.
- The fix involves calling the `pvrdma_fini(pdev)` function to properly release resources when `rc` (return code) is not 0 (meaning an error has occurred).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects QEMU's PVRDMA device initialization.
- Ubuntu 18.10 was affected, and the issue was resolved by disabling PVRDMA support.
- Red Hat Bugzilla also tracks the vulnerability and its fix.
