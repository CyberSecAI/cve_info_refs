- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided field names when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `/api/resource/Item` endpoint accepts a `fields` parameter, which is directly used in the SQL query without proper escaping or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists. The lack of input sanitization on the `fields` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, and complete compromise of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/api/resource/Item` endpoint, including a `fields` parameter with malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This would typically be anyone who can access the application's API.
