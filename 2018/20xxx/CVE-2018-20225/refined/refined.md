  "CVE-2018-20225": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-20225",
      "Description": "python-pip: when --extra-index-url option is used and package does not already exist in the public index, the installation of malicious package with arbitrary version number is possible."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "pip installs the version with the highest version number even if the user intended to obtain a private package from a private index using the `--extra-index-url` option. When a package is not present in the public index, an attacker can create a malicious package with an arbitrary version number on a public index. Pip will install that malicious package if its version number is higher than that available in the private index, even if the user intended to install the private package.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Dependency Confusion",
         "Insecure package installation"
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution by installing a malicious package from a public index instead of the intended private package.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public index with the same name as a private package. The victim's system is configured to use an extra index URL in addition to the public one using the `--extra-index-url` option.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a public package index and the name of the package to be installed from the private index is not yet taken on the public index. The attacker must also be able to create a package with the same name as the private package, but with a higher version number.",
       "Additional Details": "This issue arises from pip's behavior of selecting the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects users of the `--extra-index-url` option when the package name has not been claimed in the public index. The reporter of the vulnerability found several public instances of PyPI servers that were using `--extra-index-url` without `--index-url` which made them vulnerable. Some of the vulnerable instances were found to be used by CERN for some of their python packages."
