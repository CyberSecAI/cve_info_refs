{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `patch` utility, when using the `ed` editor, did not sanitize filenames. Specifically, it did not block filenames beginning with a `!` character. The `ed` editor, when receiving a filename beginning with `!`, interprets it as a shell command which is then executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "OS Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution as the user running the `patch` command can be achieved by crafting a malicious patch file.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious patch file crafted to contain filenames beginning with `!`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted patch file to the victim who will then apply the patch using the vulnerable `patch` utility."
