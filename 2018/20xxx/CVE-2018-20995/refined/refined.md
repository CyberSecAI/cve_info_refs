Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of head and tail pointers in the `slice-deque` crate when inserting or removing elements from the front of the deque under specific memory conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability arising from incorrect manipulation of the deque's head and tail pointers.
- **Incorrect Head/Tail Update:** Specifically, the `move_head_unchecked` function failed to properly update these pointers when the tail resided in the mirrored memory region before an operation, and the head ended up at the start of the mirrored region after the operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Corrupted Deque State:** By carefully controlling element insertion and removal, an attacker can force the deque into a corrupted state.
- **Memory Access Issues:** This corrupted state leads to:
    - Partial reads and writes.
    - Reads of uninitialized memory.
    - Reads of memory containing previously dropped objects.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** These memory access issues can be exploited to alter program execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via network as per CVSS.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the state of the `slice-deque` via a program that uses it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over Element Insertion/Removal:** An attacker needs control over both the insertion and removal of elements from the deque.
- **Specific Memory Conditions:** The vulnerability requires a specific sequence of operations that trigger the described memory layout in `slice-deque`.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of the `slice-deque` crate prior to 0.1.16 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.1.16 and later.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is related to CWE-119, which covers improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer.
- **References:** The provided content includes links to the CVE record, RustSec advisory, and a related GitHub issue, offering more context and detail.
