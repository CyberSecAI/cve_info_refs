Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-20525:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input in the `copydir.php`, `copyfile.php`, and `fileslist.php` files of Roxy Fileman. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or validate directory paths provided in the `d` and `f` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. By manipulating the `d` and `f` parameters with `../` sequences, an attacker can access files and directories outside of the intended upload directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This includes sensitive files like configuration files, password files, and other data not meant to be publicly accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable PHP files (`copydir.php`, `copyfile.php`, `fileslist.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Roxy Fileman instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the location of the `fileman` directory.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit examples do not show any authentication, implying that this vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Roxy Fileman version 1.4.5.
*   The vulnerable files are `copydir.php`, `copyfile.php`, and `fileslist.php`.
*   The `d` parameter (likely for directory) and `f` parameter (likely for file) within POST requests are used to send directory traversal sequences such as `/fileman/Uploads/*/../../../../../../../../etc/*` to access system files such as `/etc/passwd`.
