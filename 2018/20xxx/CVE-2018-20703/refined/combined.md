**Can I patch store manually without upgrading?**

This can be done by updating one line of code.

Open classes/admin.class.php. Find:

```
public function passwordRequest($username, $email)
{
```

Replace with:

```
public function passwordRequest($username, $email)
{
    $username = preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9.@_\-\+]/i', '', $username);
```
