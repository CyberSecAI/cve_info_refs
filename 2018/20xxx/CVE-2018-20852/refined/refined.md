Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-20852 and CVE-2019-16056, as well as related context from various sources:

**CVE-2018-20852**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect domain validation within Python's `http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok` function. The function uses a suffix match instead of a precise domain match, and does not check for a missing leading dot in the domain string before the check.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of the domain attribute in cookies. Allows for cookies to be sent to unintended subdomains
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies intended for a legitimate domain by using a server with a hostname that is a suffix of the legitimate domain (e.g., `pythonicexample.com` stealing cookies for `example.com`). This can lead to unauthorized access to user sessions and data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By intercepting an HTTP connection made by an application to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker could get cookies. This is because the application using the vulnerable `http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy` or related policy is passing the cookies even though the server does not have a matching domain.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to control a server, which acts as a rogue subdomain with the crafted hostname to steal the cookies

**CVE-2019-16056**

*   **Root Cause:** The `email.utils.parseaddr` function in Python's email module incorrectly parses email addresses containing multiple `@` characters.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect parsing of email addresses, where multiple `@` characters are not handled as errors.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Applications that use the `email` module for email address validation may be tricked into accepting malicious email addresses, potentially bypassing security checks on `From` and `To` headers. This could allow attackers to send malicious emails masquerading as valid users or abuse other applications using the email library to do recipient based validation
*  **Attack Vectors:** By sending an email containing multiple `@` characters, and then relying on an application that is vulnerable to this misparsing
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to send an email to the vulnerable application

**Additional Details and Observations:**

*   **SUSE Information:** SUSE's analysis of CVE-2018-20852 rates it as moderate severity, although it notes an affected application must have some other vulnerability to allow the exploitation. It includes CVSS v2 and v3 scores and lists various SUSE security advisories related to the fix. SUSE states that this issue is resolved
*   **Python 2.7.17:** The `python.org` content indicates that Python 2.7.17 is a bug fix release and expected to be the penultimate release, containing fixes for CVE-2018-20852 and others.
*   **Debian Information:** Debian's LTS advisory (DLA 2337-1) states that multiple vulnerabilities were fixed including CVE-2018-20852, CVE-2019-16056 and more, also stating a security regression of CVE-2019-9636 (CVE-2019-10160) was fixed.
*   **openSUSE Information:** openSUSEâ€™s updates and discussions confirm that CVE-2018-20852 has been addressed. openSUSE-SU-2019:1988-1 also indicates the information leak where cookies could be sent to the wrong server due to domain validation was fixed. openSUSE-SU-2020:0086-1 confirms that CVE-2018-20852 and others have been fixed for python3.
*  **Red Hat:** Red Hat Bugzilla entry 1749103 describes a bug fix in rh-python36 that resolves unpickling of datetime.date objects and is a clone of another bug. Bugzilla entry 1709344 describes a python3 rebase for python and includes various bug fixes including CVE-2018-20852. Bugzilla entry 1749839 provides a fix for python email parsing and mentions CVE-2019-16056. Security advisory RHSA-2019:3725 includes python36 fixes for these issues. RHSA-2019:3948 states a fix for CVE-2018-20852 and CVE-2019-16056 for python27 packages. Red Hat includes information on its severity ratings and their CVSS v3 base metrics, indicating that CVSS scores alone do not determine priority.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202003-26) mentions that multiple vulnerabilities in Python were addressed, stating that the worst of which could result in a Denial of Service condition. These included CVE-2018-20852, CVE-2019-9636, and others.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4127-1) lists CVE-2018-20406, CVE-2018-20852, CVE-2019-9636, CVE-2019-10160, CVE-2019-5010, CVE-2019-9740, CVE-2019-9947, CVE-2019-9948 as addressed issues, and provides package versions that fix the flaws. USN-4127-2 provides the same fixes for python2.7 and python3.4 in older versions of Ubuntu.
*   **cpython Github:** The github diffs included show that the primary fix included is related to the  cookiejar domain validation in  `Lib/http/cookiejar.py` and in `Lib/cookielib.py` for py2 backports. They prefix a dot to the domain string to make sure that there is not partial domain matching. The commits also include related tests and news entries.
*  **Security Team:** Several mentions in various places point out that the initial reports on these vulnerabilities were sent to the python security team.

In summary, both CVE-2018-20852 and CVE-2019-16056 represent flaws in the Python standard library that, if not addressed, can lead to security compromises. CVE-2018-20852 is about potentially leaking cookie data to attacker servers and CVE-2019-16056 is about email address misparsing, bypassing validation. Patches were released by most vendors, and it is important to stay updated with those security advisories.
