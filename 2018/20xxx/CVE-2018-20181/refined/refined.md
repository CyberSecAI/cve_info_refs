Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20181:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer underflow in the `seamless_process()` function within rdesktop. This underflow leads to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer Underflow: When processing data from an RDP server, a calculation involving the remaining packet length results in an integer underflow.
- Heap-Based Buffer Overflow: Due to the integer underflow, a subsequent memory allocation results in a buffer that's too small. When data is copied to this buffer, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory Corruption: The buffer overflow corrupts memory, which can destabilize the application.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): The memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the client machine, granting the attacker control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: A malicious RDP server sends specially crafted RDP messages to the client, exploiting the integer underflow and buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control an RDP server that a vulnerable client connects to. No user interaction is required by the client for the attack to occur.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in `rdesktop` versions up to and including 1.8.3.
- The vulnerability is located in the seamless channel processing.
- This CVE is one of a series of vulnerabilities discovered by Check Point Research.
- The vulnerability is triggered in `seamless_process()` function as a result of the server sending a specially crafted RDP message to the client.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `4dca546d04321a610c1835010b5dad85163b65e1` in the rdesktop repository.
