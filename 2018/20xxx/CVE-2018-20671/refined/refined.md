Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-20671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Integer overflow in the `load_specific_debug_section` function of `objdump.c` in GNU Binutils. This occurs when processing a crafted ELF file with a specific debug section size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Integer overflow: A multiplication or addition involving section size is performed without proper checks, which leads to an incorrect result and subsequently, a heap-based buffer overflow.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The integer overflow leads to an incorrect memory allocation size, resulting in a buffer overflow when data is copied into the undersized memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of service: A crafted ELF file can cause `objdump` to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Possible arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, it mentions that a remote attacker could "possibly execute arbitrary code"
- Use-after-free: The code mentions a use-after-free vulnerability related to the error function in elfcomm.c, that is triggered when called from the process_archive function in readelf.c

**Attack vectors:**

- Processing of a specially crafted ELF file: The vulnerability is triggered when `objdump` or similar tools try to process a malicious ELF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ELF file to a user or automated system that uses GNU binutils.
- The attacker must be able to entice a user to process the crafted file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `objdump` (or similar) is used on the crafted file, so the attacker's position is remote but only affects a local system.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The SUSE security team considers `binutils` a developer tool not designed to receive untrusted input, suggesting users process untrusted code in isolated environments.
- The fix involves a patch that prevents heap corruption by adding integer overflow checks before memory allocation.
