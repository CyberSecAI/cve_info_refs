Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-20430:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content, specifically the Debian Security Advisories (DSA 4361-1 and DLA 1616-1), explicitly mentions CVE-2018-20430 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed. The description of the vulnerability within these advisories is consistent with the stated purpose of libextractor.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability found in the `common/convert.c` file of the libextractor library.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability occurs when the library attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer in the `convert.c` file.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition, leading to an application crash.
    - **Memory Disclosure:** The DSA-4361-1 advisory mentions that a malformed OLE file can lead to memory disclosure. While not explicitly stated as being related to the out-of-bounds read, it's a related impact of exploiting vulnerabilities in libextractor when processing malformed files.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Malformed OLE files:** The vulnerability is triggered when libextractor processes a malformed OLE file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted, malformed OLE file to the libextractor library for processing. This implies the attacker either has the ability to influence what files are processed by the application using libextractor or can provide a malicious file (e.g., via email attachment, a download page, or user upload).

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-20430 identifies an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `common/convert.c` within the libextractor library. This vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed OLE files. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service (application crash) and possibly memory disclosure, depending on the specific malformation. Attackers can exploit this by providing crafted files to vulnerable applications.
