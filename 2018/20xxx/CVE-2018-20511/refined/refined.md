Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20511:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Appletalk IP/DDP implementation in the Linux kernel had a flaw where it could expose kernel memory addresses to user space. Specifically, the `SIOCFINDIPDDPRT` ioctl could copy the `dev` and `next` pointers from the `ipddp_route` structure to user space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows for the exposure of kernel memory addresses, potentially aiding in the exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
- **Improper Access Control:** While access to the vulnerability requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities, this does not fully mitigate the risk, as privileged users could still potentially leak sensitive information

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Exposure:** An attacker can potentially learn kernel memory addresses. While this vulnerability is not directly exploitable, the leaked information could be used to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) or facilitate exploitation of other kernel vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a local attack, by invoking the `SIOCFINDIPDDPRT` ioctl with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability. This is typically held by the root user but can be granted to other users/processes via Linux capabilities.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The fix involves modifying the `ipddp_ioctl` function to manually copy the relevant fields of the `ipddp_route` structure instead of using `memcpy()`.
- A patch addressing this issue was included in the Linux kernel version 4.18.
- The issue was reported by InfoSect.

This vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel and affects systems running with an Appletalk stack enabled.
