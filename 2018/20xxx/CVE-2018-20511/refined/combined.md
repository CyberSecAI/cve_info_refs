## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

net/appletalk: fix minor pointer leak to userspace in SIOCFINDIPDDPRTFields ->dev and ->next of struct ipddp\_route may be copied to
userspace on the SIOCFINDIPDDPRT ioctl. This is only accessible
to CAP\_NET\_ADMIN though. Let's manually copy the relevant fields
instead of using memcpy().

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

```

instead of using memcpy().

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

spi: Fix double IDR allocation with DT aliases
commit 04b2d03a75652bda989de1595048f0501dc0c0a0 upstream.
If the SPI bus number is provided by a DT alias, idr\_alloc() is called
twice, leading to:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 1 at drivers/spi/spi.c:2179 spi\_register\_controller+0x11c/0x5d8
couldn't get idr
Fix this by moving the handling of fixed SPI bus numbers up, before the
DT handling code fills in ctlr->bus\_num.

sched/fair: Fix vruntime\_normalized() for remote non-migration wakeup
commit d0cdb3ce8834332d918fc9c8ff74f8a169ec9abe upstream.
When a task which previously ran on a given CPU is remotely queued to
wake up on that same CPU, there is a period where the task's state is
TASK\_WAKING and its vruntime is not normalized. This is not accounted
for in vruntime\_normalized() which will cause an error in the task's
vruntime if it is switched from the fair class during this time.
For example if it is boosted to RT priority via rt\_mutex\_setprio(),
rq->min\_vruntime will not be subtracted from the task's vruntime but
it will be added again when the task returns to the fair class. The
task's vruntime will have been erroneously doubled and the effective
priority of the task will be reduced.
Note this will also lead to inflation of all vruntimes since the doubled
vruntime value will become the rq's min\_vruntime when other tasks leave
the rq. This leads to repeated doubling of the vruntime and priority
penalty.
Fix this by recognizing a WAKING task's vruntime as normalized only if
sched\_remote\_wakeup is true. This indicates a migration, in which case
the vruntime would have been normalized in migrate\_task\_rq\_fair().
Based on a similar patch from John Dias .

ext4, dax: set ext4\_dax\_aops for dax files
commit cce6c9f7e6029caee45c459db5b3e78fec6973cb upstream.
Sync syscall to DAX file needs to flush processor cache, but it
currently does not flush to existing DAX files. This is because
'ext4\_da\_aops' is set to address\_space\_operations of existing DAX
files, instead of 'ext4\_dax\_aops', since S\_DAX flag is set after
ext4\_set\_aops() in the open path.

commit 94dbb63117e82253c9592816aa4465f0a9c94850 upstream.
Ext4 mount path calls .bmap to the journal inode. This currently
works for the DAX mount case because ext4\_iget() always set
'ext4\_da\_aops' to any regular files.
In preparation to fix ext4\_iget() to set 'ext4\_dax\_aops' for ext4
DAX files, add ext4\_bmap() to 'ext4\_dax\_aops', since bmap works for
DAX inodes.

commit fe18d649891d813964d3aaeebad873f281627fbc upstream.
Marking mmp bh dirty before writing it will make writeback

duplicate write as kmmpd thread should have full control of
reading and writing the mmp block.
Another reason is we will also have random I/O error on
the writeback request when blk integrity is enabled, because
kmmpd could modify the content of the mmp block(e.g. setting
new seq and time) while the mmp block is under I/O requested

ext4: recalucate superblock checksum after updating free blocks/inodes
commit 4274f516d4bc50648a4d97e4f67ecbd7b65cde4a upstream.
When mounting the superblock, ext4\_fill\_super() calculates the free
blocks and free inodes and stores them in the superblock. It's not
strictly necessary, since we don't use them any more, but it's nice to
keep them roughly aligned to reality.
Since it's not critical for file system correctness, the code doesn't
call ext4\_commit\_super(). The problem is that it's in
ext4\_commit\_super() that we recalculate the superblock checksum. So
if we're not going to call ext4\_commit\_super(), we need to call
ext4\_superblock\_csum\_set() to make sure the superblock checksum is
consistent.
Most of the time, this doesn't matter, since we end up calling
ext4\_commit\_super() very soon thereafter, and definitely by the time
the file system is unmounted. However, it doesn't work in this
sequence:
mke2fs -Fq -t ext4 /dev/vdc 128M
mount /dev/vdc /vdc
cp xfstests/git-versions /vdc
godown /vdc
umount /vdc
mount /dev/vdc
tune2fs -l /dev/vdc
With this commit, the "tune2fs -l" no longer fails.

ext4: avoid divide by zero fault when deleting corrupted inline directories
commit 4d982e25d0bdc83d8c64e66fdeca0b89240b3b85 upstream.
A specially crafted file system can trick empty\_inline\_dir() into
reading past the last valid entry in a inline directory, and then run
into the end of xattr marker. This will trigger a divide by zero
fault. Fix this by using the size of the inline directory instead of
dir->i\_size.
Also clean up error reporting in \_\_ext4\_check\_dir\_entry so that the
message is clearer and more understandable --- and avoids the division
by zero trap if the size passed in is zero. (I'm not sure why we

ext4: check to make sure the rename(2)'s destination is not freed
commit b50282f3241acee880514212d88b6049fb5039c8 upstream.
If the destination of the rename(2) system call exists, the inode's
link count (i\_nlinks) must be non-zero. If it is, the inode can end
up on the orphan list prematurely, leading to all sorts of hilarity,
including a use-after-free.

tty: vt\_ioctl: fix potential Spectre v1
commit e97267cb4d1ee01ca0929638ec0fcbb0904f903d upstream.
vsa.console is indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
drivers/tty/vt/vt\_ioctl.c:711 vt\_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue
'vc\_cons' [r]
Fix this by sanitizing vsa.console before using it to index vc\_cons
Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].

drm: udl: Destroy framebuffer only if it was initialized
commit fcb74da1eb8edd3a4ef9b9724f88ed709d684227 upstream.
This fixes a NULL pointer dereference that can happen if the UDL
driver is unloaded before the framebuffer is initialized. This can
happen e.g. if the USB device is unplugged right after it was plugged
in.
As explained by Stéphane Marchesin:
It happens when fbdev is disabled (which is the case for Chrome OS).
Even though intialization of the fbdev part is optional (it's done in
udlfb\_create which is the callback for fb\_probe()), the teardown isn't
optional (udl\_driver\_unload -> udl\_fbdev\_cleanup ->
udl\_fbdev\_destroy).
Note that udl\_fbdev\_cleanup \*tries\* to be conditional (you can see it
does if (!udl->fbdev)) but that doesn't work, because udl->fbdev is
always set during udl\_fbdev\_init.

drm/vc4: Fix the "no scaling" case on multi-planar YUV formats
commit 658d8cbd07dae22ccecf49399e18c609c4e85c53 upstream.
When there's no scaling requested ->is\_unity should be true no matter
the format.
Also, when no scaling is requested and we have a multi-planar YUV
format, we should leave ->y\_scaling[0] to VC4\_SCALING\_NONE and only
set ->x\_scaling[0] to VC4\_SCALING\_PPF.
Doing this fixes an hardly visible artifact (seen when using modetest
and a rather big overlay plane in YUV420).

drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Prevent handling ACPI HPD events too early
commit 79e765ad665da4b8aa7e9c878bd2fef837f6fea5 upstream.
On most systems with ACPI hotplugging support, it seems that we always
receive a hotplug event once we re-enable EC interrupts even if the GPU
hasn't even been resumed yet.
This can cause problems since even though we schedule hpd\_work to handle
connector reprobing for us, hpd\_work synchronizes on
pm\_runtime\_get\_sync() to wait until the device is ready to perform
reprobing. Since runtime suspend/resume callbacks are disabled before
the PM core calls ->suspend(), any calls to pm\_runtime\_get\_sync() during
this period will grab a runtime PM ref and return immediately with
-EACCES. Because we schedule hpd\_work from our ACPI HPD handler, and
hpd\_work synchronizes on pm\_runtime\_get\_sync(), this causes us to launch
a connector reprobe immediately even if the GPU isn't actually resumed
just yet. This causes various warnings in dmesg and occasionally, also
prevents some displays connected to the dedicated GPU from coming back
up after suspend. Example:
usb 1-4: USB disconnect, device number 14
usb 1-4.1: USB disconnect, device number 15

So, to fix this we attempt to grab a runtime PM reference in the ACPI
handler itself asynchronously. If the GPU is already awake (it will have
normal hotplugging at this point) or runtime PM callbacks are currently
disabled on the device, we drop our reference without updating the
autosuspend delay. We only schedule connector reprobes when we
successfully managed to queue up a resume request with our asynchronous
PM ref.
This also has the added benefit of preventing redundant connector
reprobes from ACPI while the GPU is runtime resumed!

drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Use pm\_runtime\_get\_noresume() in connector\_detect()
commit 6833fb1ec120bf078e1a527c573a09d4de286224 upstream.
It's true we can't resume the device from poll workers in
nouveau\_connector\_detect(). We can however, prevent the autosuspend
timer from elapsing immediately if it hasn't already without risking any
sort of deadlock with the runtime suspend/resume operations. So do that
instead of entirely avoiding grabbing a power reference.

drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Fix deadlock with fb\_helper with async RPM requests
commit 7fec8f5379fb6eddabc0aaef6d2304c366808f97 upstream.
Currently, nouveau uses the generic drm\_fb\_helper\_output\_poll\_changed()
function provided by DRM as it's output\_poll\_changed callback.
Unfortunately however, this function doesn't grab runtime PM references
early enough and even if it did-we can't block waiting for the device to
resume in output\_poll\_changed() since it's very likely that we'll need
to grab the fb\_helper lock at some point during the runtime resume
process. This currently results in deadlocking like so:

[ 246.775522] =============================================
After trying dozens of different solutions, I found one very simple one
that should also have the benefit of preventing us from having to fight
locking for the rest of our lives. So, we work around these deadlocks by
deferring all fbcon hotplug events that happen after the runtime suspend
process starts until after the device is resumed again.
Changes since v7:
- Fixup commit message - Daniel Vetter
Changes since v6:
- Remove unused nouveau\_fbcon\_hotplugged\_in\_suspend() - Ilia
Changes since v5:
- Come up with the (hopefully final) solution for solving this dumb
problem, one that is a lot less likely to cause issues with locking in
the future. This should work around all deadlock conditions with fbcon
brought up thus far.
Changes since v4:
- Add nouveau\_fbcon\_hotplugged\_in\_suspend() to workaround deadlock
condition that Lukas described
- Just move all of this out of drm\_fb\_helper. It seems that other DRM
drivers have already figured out other workarounds for this. If other
drivers do end up needing this in the future, we can just move this
back into drm\_fb\_helper again.
Changes since v3:
- Actually check if fb\_helper is NULL in both new helpers
- Actually check drm\_fbdev\_emulation in both new helpers
- Don't fire off a fb\_helper hotplug unconditionally; only do it if
the following conditions are true (as otherwise, calling this in the
wrong spot will cause Bad Things to happen):
- fb\_helper hotplug handling was actually inhibited previously
- fb\_helper actually has a delayed hotplug pending
- fb\_helper is actually bound
- fb\_helper is actually initialized
- Add \_\_must\_check to drm\_fb\_helper\_suspend\_hotplug(). There's no
situation where a driver would actually want to use this without
checking the return value, so enforce that
- Rewrite and clarify the documentation for both helpers.
- Make sure to return true in the drm\_fb\_helper\_suspend\_hotplug() stub
that's provided in drm\_fb\_helper.h when CONFIG\_DRM\_FBDEV\_EMULATION
isn't enabled
- Actually grab the toplevel fb\_helper lock in
drm\_fb\_helper\_resume\_hotplug(), since it's possible other activity
(such as a hotplug) could be going on at the same time the driver
calls drm\_fb\_helper\_resume\_hotplug(). We need this to check whether or
not drm\_fb\_helper\_hotplug\_event() needs to be called anyway

drm/nouveau/drm/nouveau: Fix bogus drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_enable() placement
commit d77ef138ff572409ab93d492e5e6c826ee6fb21d upstream.
Turns out this part is my fault for not noticing when reviewing
9a2eba337cace ("drm/nouveau: Fix drm poll\_helper handling"). Currently
we call drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_enable() from nouveau\_display\_hpd\_work().
This makes basically no sense however, because that means we're calling
drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_enable() every time we schedule the hotplug
detection work. This is also against the advice mentioned in
drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_enable()'s documentation:
Note that calls to enable and disable polling must be strictly ordered,
which is automatically the case when they're only call from
suspend/resume callbacks.
Of course, hotplugs can't really be ordered. They could even happen
immediately after we called drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_disable() in
nouveau\_display\_fini(), which can lead to all sorts of issues.
Additionally; enabling polling /after/ we call
drm\_helper\_hpd\_irq\_event() could also mean that we'd miss a hotplug
event anyway, since drm\_helper\_hpd\_irq\_event() wouldn't bother trying to
probe connectors so long as polling is disabled.
So; simply move this back into nouveau\_display\_init() again. The race
condition that both of these patches attempted to work around has
already been fixed properly in
d61a5c106351 ("drm/nouveau: Fix deadlock on runtime suspend")

Currently, there's nothing in nouveau that actually cancels this work
struct. So, cancel it on suspend/unload. Otherwise, if we're unlucky
enough hpd\_work might try to keep running up until the system is

drm/nouveau: Fix deadlocks in nouveau\_connector\_detect()
commit 3e1a12754d4df5804bfca5dedf09d2ba291bdc2a upstream.
When we disable hotplugging on the GPU, we need to be able to
synchronize with each connector's hotplug interrupt handler before the
interrupt is finally disabled. This can be a problem however, since
nouveau\_connector\_detect() currently grabs a runtime power reference
when handling connector probing. This will deadlock the runtime suspend
handler like so:

So: fix this by making it so that normal hotplug handling /only/ happens
so long as the GPU is currently awake without any pending runtime PM
requests. In the event that a hotplug occurs while the device is
suspending or resuming, we can simply defer our response until the GPU
is fully runtime resumed again.

drm/nouveau: Remove duplicate poll\_enable() in pmops\_runtime\_suspend()
commit 611ce855420a6e8b9ff47af5f47431d52c7709f8 upstream.
Since actual hotplug notifications don't get disabled until
nouveau\_display\_fini() is called, all this will do is cause any hotplugs
that happen between this drm\_kms\_helper\_poll\_disable() call and the
actual hotplug disablement to potentially be dropped if ACPI isn't
around to help us.

drm/nouveau: Only write DP\_MSTM\_CTRL when needed
commit b26b4590dd53e012526342e749c423e6c0e73437 upstream.
Currently, nouveau will re-write the DP\_MSTM\_CTRL register for an MST
hub every time it receives a long HPD pulse on DP. This isn't actually
necessary and additionally, has some unintended side effects.
With the P50 I've got here, rewriting DP\_MSTM\_CTRL constantly seems to
make it rather likely (1 out of 5 times usually) that bringing up MST
with it's ThinkPad dock will fail and result in sideband messages timing
out in the middle. Afterwards, successive probes don't manage to get the
dock to communicate properly over MST sideband properly.
Many times sideband message timeouts from MST hubs are indicative of
either the source or the sink dropping an ESI event, which can cause
DRM's perspective of the topology's current state to go out of sync with
reality. While it's tough to really know for sure what's happening to
the dock, using userspace tools to write to DP\_MSTM\_CTRL in the middle
of the MST link probing process does appear to make things flaky. It's
possible that when we write to DP\_MSTM\_CTRL, the function that gets
triggered to respond in the dock's firmware temporarily puts it in a
state where it might end up not reporting an ESI to the source, or ends
up dropping a sideband message we sent it.
So, to fix this we make it so that when probing an MST topology, we
respect it's current state. If the dock's already enabled, we simply
read DP\_MSTM\_CTRL and disable the topology if it's value is not what we
expected. Otherwise, we perform the normal MST probing dance. We avoid
taking any action except if the state of the MST topology actually
changes.
This fixes MST sideband message timeouts and detection failures on my
P50 with its ThinkPad dock.

drm/nouveau: Reset MST branching unit before enabling
commit fa3cdf8d0b092c4561f9f017dfac409eb7644737 upstream.
When probing a new MST device, it's not safe to make any assumptions
about it's current state. While most well mannered MST hubs will just
disable the branching unit on hotplug disconnects, this isn't enough to
save us from various other scenarios that might have resulted in
something writing to the MST branching unit before we got control of it.
This could happen if a previous probe we tried failed, if we're booting
in kexec context and the hub is still in the state the last kernel put
it in, etc.
Luckily; there is no reason we can't just reset the branching unit
every time we enable a new topology. So, fix this by resetting it on
enabling new topologies to ensure that we always start off with a clean,
unmodified topology state on MST sinks.
This fixes occasional hard-lockups on my P50's laptop dock (e.g. AUX
times out all DPCD trasactions) observed after multiple docks, undocks,
and module reloads.

drm/i915/bdw: Increase IPS disable timeout to 100ms
commit 92a6803149465e2339f8f7f8f6415d75be80073d upstream.
During IPS disabling the current 42ms timeout value leads to occasional
timeouts, increase it to 100ms which seems to get rid of the problem.

ocfs2: fix ocfs2 read block panic
commit 234b69e3e089d850a98e7b3145bd00e9b52b1111 upstream.
While reading block, it is possible that io error return due to underlying
storage issue, in this case, BH\_NeedsValidate was left in the buffer head.
Then when reading the very block next time, if it was already linked into
journal, that will trigger the following panic.

libata: mask swap internal and hardware tag
commit 7ce5c8cd753f9afa8e79e9ec40351998e354f239 upstream.
hen we're comparing the hardware completion mask passed in from the
driver with the internal tag pending mask, we need to account for the
fact that the internal tag is different from the hardware tag. If not,
then we can end up either prematurely completing the internal tag (since
it's not set in the hw mask), or simply flag an error:
ata2: illegal qc\_active transition (100000000->00000001)
If the internal tag is set, then swap that with the hardware tag in this
case before comparing with what the hardware reports.

Revert "ubifs: xattr: Don't operate on deleted inodes"
commit f061c1cc404a618858a77aea233fde0aeaad2f2d upstream.
This reverts commit 11a6fc3dc743e22fb50f2196ec55bee5140d3c52.
UBIFS wants to assert that xattr operations are only issued on files
with positive link count. The said patch made this operations return
-ENOENT for unlinked files such that the asserts will no longer trigger.
This was wrong since xattr operations are perfectly fine on unlinked
files.
Instead the assertions need to be fixed/removed.

scsi: target: iscsi: Use hex2bin instead of a re-implementation
commit 1816494330a83f2a064499d8ed2797045641f92c upstream.
This change has the following effects, in order of descreasing importance:
1) Prevent a stack buffer overflow
2) Do not append an unnecessary NULL to an anyway binary buffer, which
is writing one byte past client\_digest when caller is:
chap\_string\_to\_hex(client\_digest, chap\_r, strlen(chap\_r));
The latter was found by KASAN (see below) when input value hes expected size
(32 hex chars), and further analysis revealed a stack buffer overflow can
happen when network-received value is longer, allowing an unauthenticated
remote attacker to smash up to 17 bytes after destination buffer (16 bytes
attacker-controlled and one null). As switching to hex2bin requires
specifying destination buffer length, and does not internally append any null,
it solves both issues.
This addresses CVE-2018-14633.
Beyond this:
- Validate received value length and check hex2bin accepted the input, to log
this rejection reason instead of just failing authentication.
- Only log received CHAP\_R and CHAP\_C values once they passed sanity checks.

mm: shmem.c: Correctly annotate new inodes for lockdep
commit b45d71fb89ab8adfe727b9d0ee188ed58582a647 upstream.
Directories and inodes don't necessarily need to be in the same lockdep
class. For ex, hugetlbfs splits them out too to prevent false positives
in lockdep. Annotate correctly after new inode creation. If its a
directory inode, it will be put into a different class.
This should fix a lockdep splat reported by syzbot:

mm: disable deferred struct page for 32-bit arches
commit 889c695d419f19e5db52592dafbaf26143c36d1f upstream.
Deferred struct page init is needed only on systems with large amount of
physical memory to improve boot performance. 32-bit systems do not
benefit from this feature.

fork: report pid exhaustion correctly
commit f83606f5eb007adc33bc8541ede00590f477bdeb upstream.
Make the clone and fork syscalls return EAGAIN when the limit on the
number of pids /proc/sys/kernel/pid\_max is exceeded.
Currently, when the pid\_max limit is exceeded, the kernel will return
ENOSPC from the fork and clone syscalls. This is contrary to the
documented behaviour, which explicitly calls out the pid\_max case as one
where EAGAIN should be returned. It also leads to really confusing error
messages in userspace programs which will complain about a lack of disk
space when they fail to create processes/threads for this reason.
This error is being returned because alloc\_pid() uses the idr api to find
a new pid; when there are none available, idr\_alloc\_cyclic() returns
-ENOSPC, and this is being propagated back to userspace.
This behaviour has been broken before, and was explicitly fixed in
commit 35f71bc0a09a ("fork: report pid reservation failure properly"),
so I think -EAGAIN is definitely the right thing to return in this case.
The current behaviour change dates from commit 95846ecf9dac ("pid:
replace pid bitmap implementation with IDR AIP") and was I believe
unintentional.
This patch has no impact on the case where allocating a pid fails because
the child reaper for the namespace is dead; that case will still return
-ENOMEM.

ring-buffer: Allow for rescheduling when removing pages
commit 83f365554e47997ec68dc4eca3f5dce525cd15c3 upstream.
When reducing ring buffer size, pages are removed by scheduling a work
item on each CPU for the corresponding CPU ring buffer. After the pages
are removed from ring buffer linked list, the pages are free()d in a
tight loop. The loop does not give up CPU until all pages are removed.
In a worst case behavior, when lot of pages are to be freed, it can
cause system stall.
After the pages are removed from the list, the free() can happen while
the work is rescheduled. Call cond\_resched() in the loop to prevent the
system hangup.

spi: fix IDR collision on systems with both fixed and dynamic SPI bus numbers
commit 1a4327fbf4554d5b78d75b19a13d40d6de220159 upstream.
On systems where some controllers get a dynamic ID assigned and some have
a fixed number (e.g. from ACPI tables), the current implementation might
run into an IDR collision: in case of a fixed bus number is gotten by a
driver (but not marked busy in IDR tree) and a driver with dynamic bus
number gets the same ID and predictably fails.
Fix this by means of checking-in fixed IDsin IDR as far as dynamic ones
at the moment of the controller registration.

Commit 57f230ab04d291 ("xen/netfront: raise max number of slots in
xennet\_get\_responses()") raised the max number of allowed slots by one.
This seems to be problematic in some configurations with netback using
a larger MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS value (e.g. old Linux kernel with MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS
defined as 18 instead of nowadays 17).
Instead of BUG\_ON() in this case just fall back to retransmission.

ALSA: firewire-digi00x: fix memory leak of private data
commit a49a83ab05e34edd6c71a4fbd062c9a7ba6d18aa upstream.
Although private data of sound card instance is usually allocated in the
tail of the instance, drivers in ALSA firewire stack allocate the private

commit 49434c6c575d2008c0abbc93e615019f39e01252 upstream.
snd\_emu10k1\_fx8010\_ioctl(SNDRV\_EMU10K1\_IOCTL\_INFO) allocates
memory using kmalloc() and partially fills it by calling
snd\_emu10k1\_fx8010\_info() before returning the resulting
structure to userspace, leaving uninitialized holes. Let's
just use kzalloc() here.

ALSA: bebob: use address returned by kmalloc() instead of kernel stack for streaming DMA mapping
commit 493626f2d87a74e6dbea1686499ed6e7e600484e upstream.
When executing 'fw\_run\_transaction()' with 'TCODE\_WRITE\_BLOCK\_REQUEST',
an address of 'payload' argument is used for streaming DMA mapping by
'firewire\_ohci' module if 'size' argument is larger than 8 byte.
Although in this case the address should not be on kernel stack, current
implementation of ALSA bebob driver uses data in kernel stack for a cue
to boot M-Audio devices. This often brings unexpected result, especially
for a case of CONFIG\_VMAP\_STACK=y.
This commit fixes the bug.

ASoC: rsnd: fixup not to call clk\_get/set under non-atomic
commit 4d230d12710646788af581ba0155d83ab48b955c upstream.
Clocking operations clk\_get/set\_rate, are non-atomic,
they shouldn't be called in soc\_pcm\_trigger() which is atomic.
Following issue was found due to execution of clk\_get\_rate() causes
sleep in soc\_pcm\_trigger(), which shouldn't be blocked.
We can reproduce this issue by following
> enable CONFIG\_DEBUG\_ATOMIC\_SLEEP=y
> compile, and boot
> mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
> while true; do cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk\_summary > /dev/null; done &
> while true; do aplay xxx; done
This patch adds support to .prepare callback, and moves non-atomic
clocking operations to it. As .prepare is non-atomic, it is always
called before trigger\_start/trigger\_stop.

ASoC: tas6424: Save last fault register even when clear
commit d40e3e9e44db4b3c8777f3b515ba6097ba26e3b2 upstream.
When there is no fault bit set in a fault register we skip the fault
reporting section for that register. This also skips over saving that
registers value. We save the value so we will not double report an
error, but if an error clears then returns we will also not report it
as we did not save the all cleared register value. Fix this by saving
the fault register value in the all clear path.

NFC: Fix the number of pipes
commit e285d5bfb7e9785d289663baef252dd315e171f8 upstream.
According to ETSI TS 102 622 specification chapter 4.4 pipe identifier
is 7 bits long which allows for 128 unique pipe IDs. Because
NFC\_HCI\_MAX\_PIPES is used as the number of pipes supported and not
as the max pipe ID, its value should be 128 instead of 127.
nfc\_hci\_recv\_from\_llc extracts pipe ID from packet header using
NFC\_HCI\_FRAGMENT(0x7F) mask which allows for pipe ID value of 127.
Same happens when NCI\_HCP\_MSG\_GET\_PIPE() is being used. With
pipes array having only 127 elements and pipe ID of 127 the OOB memory
access will result.

NFC: Fix possible memory corruption when handling SHDLC I-Frame commands
commit 674d9de02aa7d521ebdf66c3958758bdd9c64e11 upstream.
When handling SHDLC I-Frame commands "pipe" field used for indexing
into an array should be checked before usage. If left unchecked it
might access memory outside of the array of size NFC\_HCI\_MAX\_PIPES(127).
Malformed NFC HCI frames could be injected by a malicious NFC device
communicating with the device being attacked (remote attack vector),
or even by an attacker with physical access to the I2C bus such that
they could influence the data transfers on that bus (local attack vector).
skb->data is controlled by the attacker and has only been sanitized in
the most trivial ways (CRC check), therefore we can consider the
create\_info struct and all of its members to tainted. 'create\_info->pipe'
with max value of 255 (uint8) is used to take an offset of the
hdev->pipes array of 127 elements which can lead to OOB write.

net: mvpp2: let phylink manage the carrier state
[ Upstream commit 41948ccb4a856dddacfbd4d789d4fa8663fe41bb ]
Net drivers using phylink shouldn't mess with the link carrier
themselves and should let phylink manage it. The mvpp2 driver wasn't
following this best practice as the mac\_config() function made calls to
change the link carrier state. This led to wrongly reported carrier link
state which then triggered other issues. This patch fixes this
behaviour.
But the PPv2 driver relied on this misbehaviour in two cases: for fixed
links and when not using phylink (ACPI mode). The later was fixed by
adding an explicit call to link\_up(), which when the ACPI mode will use
phylink should be removed.
The fixed link case was relying on the mac\_config() function to set the
link up, as we found an issue in phylink\_start() which assumes the
carrier is off. If not, the link\_up() function is never called. To fix
this, a call to netif\_carrier\_off() is added just before phylink\_start()
so that we do not introduce a regression in the driver.

[ Upstream commit 30bfd93062814d6767e452a8f5ddcd97f7e38c7e ]
DST\_NOCOUNT in dst\_entry::flags tracks whether the entry counts
toward route cache size (net->ipv6.sysctl.ip6\_rt\_max\_size).
If the flag is NOT set, dst\_ops::pcpuc\_entries counter is incremented
in dist\_init() and decremented in dst\_destroy().
This flag is tied to allocation/deallocation of dst\_entry and
should not be copied from another dst/route. Otherwise it can happen
that dst\_ops::pcpuc\_entries counter grows until no new routes can
be allocated because the counter reached ip6\_rt\_max\_size due to
DST\_NOCOUNT not set and thus no counter decrements on gc-ed routes.

ipv6: use rt6\_info members when dst is set in rt6\_fill\_node
[ Upstream commit 22d0bd82cc7cec7d9ed4bd5913f3ab65643364be ]
In inet6\_rtm\_getroute, since Commit 93531c674315 ("net/ipv6: separate
handling of FIB entries from dst based routes"), it has used rt->from
to dump route info instead of rt.
However for some route like cache, some of its information like flags
or gateway is not the same as that of the 'from' one. It caused 'ip
route get' to dump the wrong route information.
In Jianlin's testing, the output information even lost the expiration
time for a pmtu route cache due to the wrong fib6\_flags.
So change to use rt6\_info members for dst addr, src addr, flags and
gateway when it tries to dump a route entry without fibmatch set.
v1->v2:
- not use rt6i\_prefsrc.
- also fix the gw dump issue.

bnxt\_en: Fix VF mac address regression.
[ Upstream commit 28ea334bd1657f3c43485b4a8592672fc6835fac ]
The recent commit to always forward the VF MAC address to the PF for
approval may not work if the PF driver or the firmware is older. This
will cause the VF driver to fail during probe:
bnxt\_en 0000:00:03.0 (unnamed net\_device) (uninitialized): hwrm req\_type 0xf seq id 0x5 error 0xffff
bnxt\_en 0000:00:03.0 (unnamed net\_device) (uninitialized): VF MAC address 00:00:17:02:05:d0 not approved by the PF
bnxt\_en 0000:00:03.0: Unable to initialize mac address.
bnxt\_en: probe of 0000:00:03.0 failed with error -99
We fix it by treating the error as fatal only if the VF MAC address is
locally generated by the VF.

tls: fix currently broken MSG\_PEEK behavior

In kTLS MSG\_PEEK behavior is currently failing, strace example:

[pid 2430] socket(AF\_INET, SOCK\_STREAM, IPPROTO\_IP) = 4

[pid 2430] recvfrom(5, "test\_read\_peektest\_read\_peektest"..., 64, MSG\_PEEK, NULL, NULL) = 64
As can be seen from strace, there are two TLS records sent,
i) 'test\_read\_peek' and ii) '\_mult\_recs\0' where we end up
peeking 'test\_read\_peektest\_read\_peektest'. This is clearly
wrong, and what happens is that given peek cannot call into
tls\_sw\_advance\_skb() to unpause strparser and proceed with
the next skb, we end up looping over the current one, copying
the 'test\_read\_peek' over and over into the user provided
buffer.
Here, we can only peek into the currently held skb (current,
full TLS record) as otherwise we would end up having to hold
all the original skb(s) (depending on the peek depth) in a
separate queue when unpausing strparser to process next
records, minimally intrusive is to return only up to the
current record's size (which likely was what c46234ebb4d1
("tls: RX path for ktls") originally intended as well). Thus,
after patch we properly peek the first record:

socket: fix struct ifreq size in compat ioctl
[ Upstream commit 1cebf8f143c21eb422cd0f4e27ab2ae366eb4d04 ]
As reported by Reobert O'Callahan, since Viro's commit to kill
dev\_ifsioc() we attempt to copy too much data in compat mode,
which may lead to EFAULT when the 32-bit version of struct ifreq
sits at/near the end of a page boundary, and the next page isn't
mapped.
Fix this by passing the approprate compat/non-compat size to copy
and using that, as before the dev\_ifsioc() removal. This works
because only the embedded "struct ifmap" has different size, and
this is only used in SIOCGIFMAP/SIOCSIFMAP which has a different
handler. All other parts of the union are naturally compatible.
This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=199469.

hv\_netvsc: fix schedule in RCU context
[ Upstream commit 018349d70f28a78d5343b3660cb66e1667005f8a ]
When netvsc device is removed it can call reschedule in RCU context.
This happens because canceling the subchannel setup work could (in theory)
cause a reschedule when manipulating the timer.
To reproduce, run with lockdep enabled kernel and unbind
a network device from hv\_netvsc (via sysfs).

udp6: add missing checks on edumux packet processing
[ Upstream commit eb63f2964dbe36f26deac77d3016791675821ded ]
Currently the UDPv6 early demux rx code path lacks some mandatory
checks, already implemented into the normal RX code path - namely
the checksum conversion and no\_check6\_rx check.
Similar to the previous commit, we move the common processing to
an UDPv6 specific helper and call it from both edemux code path
and normal code path. In respect to the UDPv4, we need to add an
explicit check for non zero csum according to no\_check6\_rx value.

neighbour: confirm neigh entries when ARP packet is received
[ Upstream commit f0e0d04413fcce9bc76388839099aee93cd0d33b ]
Update 'confirmed' timestamp when ARP packet is received. It shouldn't
affect locktime logic and anyway entry can be confirmed by any higher-layer
protocol. Thus it makes sense to confirm it when ARP packet is received.

Introduce union tls\_crypto\_context, and replace the two identical

udp4: fix IP\_CMSG\_CHECKSUM for connected sockets
[ Upstream commit 2b5a921740a55c00223a797d075b9c77c42cb171 ]
commit 2abb7cdc0dc8 ("udp: Add support for doing checksum
unnecessary conversion") left out the early demux path for
connected sockets. As a result IP\_CMSG\_CHECKSUM gives wrong
values for such socket when GRO is not enabled/available.
This change addresses the issue by moving the csum conversion to a
common helper and using such helper in both the default and the
early demux rx path.

qmi\_wwan: set DTR for modems in forced USB2 mode
[ Upstream commit 922005c7f50e7f4b2a6dbc182e9c575b4f92396b ]
Recent firmware revisions have added the ability to force
these modems to USB2 mode, hiding their SuperSpeed
capabilities from the host. The driver has been using the
SuperSpeed capability, as shown by the bcdUSB field of the
device descriptor, to detect the need to enable the DTR
quirk. This method fails when the modems are forced to
USB2 mode by the modem firmware.
Fix by unconditionally enabling the DTR quirk for the
affected device IDs.

pppoe: fix reception of frames with no mac header
[ Upstream commit 8540827ebac6b654ab2f69c8fbce9e4fbd6304a0 ]
pppoe\_rcv() needs to look back at the Ethernet header in order to
lookup the PPPoE session. Therefore we need to ensure that the mac
header is big enough to contain an Ethernet header. Otherwise
eth\_hdr(skb)->h\_source might access invalid data.

net: hp100: fix always-true check for link up state
[ Upstream commit a7f38002fb69b44f8fc622ecb838665d0b8666af ]
The operation ~(p100\_inb(VG\_LAN\_CFG\_1) & HP100\_LINK\_UP) returns a value
that is always non-zero and hence the wait for the link to drop always
terminates prematurely. Fix this by using a logical not operator instead
of a bitwise complement. This issue has been in the driver since
pre-2.6.12-rc2.

gso\_segment: Reset skb->mac\_len after modifying network header
[ Upstream commit c56cae23c6b167acc68043c683c4573b80cbcc2c ]
When splitting a GSO segment that consists of encapsulated packets, the
skb->mac\_len of the segments can end up being set wrong, causing packet
drops in particular when using act\_mirred and ifb interfaces in
combination with a qdisc that splits GSO packets.
This happens because at the time skb\_segment() is called, network\_header
will point to the inner header, throwing off the calculation in
skb\_reset\_mac\_len(). The network\_header is subsequently adjust by the
outer IP gso\_segment handlers, but they don't set the mac\_len.
Fix this by adding skb\_reset\_mac\_len() calls to both the IPv4 and IPv6
gso\_segment handlers, after they modify the network\_header.
Many thanks to Eric Dumazet for his help in identifying the cause of
the bug.
