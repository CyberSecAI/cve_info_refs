Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-20230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the `read_bytes_internal` function within the `pspp` (version 1.2.0) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  The `fread` function within `read_bytes_internal` attempts to read more data into a buffer than it is allocated to hold leading to memory corruption. The overflow occurs when parsing a specially crafted `.sav` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash, which can result in a denial of service.  The program terminates due to the memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted `.sav` file using the `pspp-dump-sav` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to provide a malicious `.sav` file to a user who would then process this file with the vulnerable `pspp-dump-sav` utility. This implies that the attacker can either socially engineer the user to process the file or can inject the file within a trusted environment.
