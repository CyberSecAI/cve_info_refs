The provided content is related to CVE-2018-20757.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when handling extended user fields. Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-supplied input for "Container name" and "Attribute name" fields, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the user profile fields, which will be stored in the application's database. When the profile information is rendered in a user's browser, the injected script is executed, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially allowing them to:
  - Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking
  - Redirect users to phishing sites
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user
  - Deface website content
  - Install malware on the victim's machine

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have access to modify or add user profile data. This could occur through an admin interface, a vulnerable user profile creation form, or some similar user interface.
- The malicious payload is injected into the "Container name" and "Attribute name" fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify or create extended user fields. This likely implies that they have at least some access to the application, perhaps as an authenticated user or administrator.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML and JavaScript code into the fields.
