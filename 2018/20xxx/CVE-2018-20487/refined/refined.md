Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-20487

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `firewall3` service, commonly used in OpenWRT-based firmwares (including Inteno's IOPSYS devices), does not properly validate the paths of included scripts specified in firewall rules. This allows an authenticated attacker to specify arbitrary paths to scripts located anywhere on the filesystem, including USB drives, which will then be executed by `firewall3`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Lack of Path Validation:** `firewall3` does not check if the specified paths for included scripts are valid or safe.
2.  **Insufficient ACLs**: Any authenticated user can add firewall rules via UCI, including those that specify script paths.
3.  **Execution as Root:** `firewall3` runs as the root user, allowing any included script to be executed with root privileges.
4.  **Direct System Call:** `firewall3` uses the `system()` call directly to execute the scripts without sanitization. While `stat()` is called to check the existence of a path, this check can be easily bypassed by providing a path to an existing file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code as root on the target device. This can lead to complete control over the device.
-   **System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can install backdoors, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Firewall Rule Modification:** By crafting a malicious JSON RPC request to add a firewall include rule with a path to a malicious script.
-   **UCI Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the UCI (Unified Configuration Interface) via the `uci add` and `uci commit` commands.
-   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate with the device's API in order to add firewall rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access the device's API and send UCI commands.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious API requests.
-   **File System Access:** The attacker needs a way to place their malicious script on the target device's filesystem, this can be done using a USB drive or by manipulating other configuration files.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted JSON-RPC call to the device's `uci` interface, which is used to manage the device's firewall.
-   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) involves adding a firewall rule that includes a script located on a USB drive. This script sets up a reverse shell, granting the attacker root access.
-   The vulnerability is present because the `firewall3` service directly executes the script specified in the include rule.
-   The blog post also mentions that while using `$(cmd)` or `;cmd` directly in the path parameter was attempted, this was not possible due to the `stat()` call that ensures the validity of the provided path.
-   The fix created by the vendor restricts ACLs to block any attempts to edit or add firewall rules with a path to scripts.
