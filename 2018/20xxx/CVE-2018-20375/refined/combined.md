```

Dear all,

```
While fuzzing tcc, an out of bounds write was found in the sym\_pop
function.
```

```
Attached are a file producing a crash when compiled and the output of
the clang address sanitizer and valgrind.
```

```
The asan report only shows an out of bounds read, valgrind also shows
the out of bounds write.
```

There are multiple inputs leading to the same crash,
they are included in the attached file as comments.

To reproduce, compile the attached input file with tcc

    tcc sym_pop-oob_read.c

```
The latest git version of tcc (commit
c4787e3626904fc542bd640cc368a9d306347008) was tested.
```
