- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write occurs in the `sym_pop` function of TinyCC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution if exploited further.
- **Attack vectors:** Compiling a specially crafted C file using `tcc`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to compile a malicious C file with the vulnerable version of tcc.
