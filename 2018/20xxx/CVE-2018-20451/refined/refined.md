Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2018-20451.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `process_file` function at `reader.c:203`. This occurs due to an out-of-bounds read while processing a file, which indicates that the code is attempting to read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The overflow corrupts heap memory, leading to crashes. The backtrace and ASan output show that a memory corruption error occurs during a `malloc()` call after the overflow.
- Program termination: The program aborts due to the memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Input file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted input file using the `doc2txt` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious input file that will trigger the heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `process_file` function of the `libdoc` library.
- The attacker must be able to execute the `doc2txt` tool with the crafted input file.

**Additional details:**
- The provided ASan debug information clearly pinpoints the exact location of the vulnerability (`reader.c:203`).
- The provided `gdb` backtrace also shows the call stack leading to the crash due to the memory corruption.
- The crash occurs during a `malloc()` call, triggered by corrupted heap metadata due to the overflow.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file is provided, which demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The issue was reported by Zhao Liang from Huawei Weiran Labs.
