Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-20026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints. The CODESYS routing protocol does not properly restrict communication channels, allowing the source of communication packets to be spoofed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly restrict communication channels, enabling the source of communication packets to be disguised or spoofed. This allows attackers to send malicious packets that appear to originate from a legitimate source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to disguise the source of malicious communication packets.
- This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a network position where they can send packets to the vulnerable device.
- Low skill level is required to exploit.
