The provided content is related to CVE-2018-12112.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `md_build_attribute` function of the `md4c` library. This occurs when processing a specially crafted markdown file. The `raw_size` parameter is calculated incorrectly, leading to an attempt to allocate a very large amount of memory, causing a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow due to incorrect size calculation in `md_build_attribute` function.
- Integer overflow when calculating the size of the attribute, which results in a very large `raw_size` value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to a segmentation fault.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the heap overflow is carefully crafted, though not directly mentioned in this report.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a malicious markdown file using `md2html`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing markdown text that contains a large link or attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted markdown file to the vulnerable `md4c` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The `raw_size` value of 4294966501 causes the overflow.
- The issue occurs at `md4c/md4c.c:1462` when checking for the null terminator in the attribute text.
- A PoC file is provided in the github issue report: [poc](https://github.com/Edward-L/fuzzing-pocs/blob/master/md4c/heap_overflow_in_md_build_attribute_md4c_c_1462.poc)
