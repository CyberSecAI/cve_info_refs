Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as an **out-of-bounds write**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core issue is that the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This is a common type of memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to **arbitrary code execution**. This means an attacker can potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine, gaining control of their system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted file. This implies that the attack vector involves getting a victim to open or process a malicious file using the vulnerable software. The specific file type is not mentioned in the summary but is likely related to image processing based on the context of the surrounding CVEs that are in the same category, and the article focuses on fuzzing image parsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious file that can trigger the out-of-bounds write.
*   The attacker needs to deliver this file to a target user and entice them to open it with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found through fuzzing, a method of automated vulnerability discovery.
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   The specific vulnerable code exists in the `JP2KLib.dll` library, which is responsible for parsing JPEG2000 image format.
*   The document provides a deep dive into how the researchers built a harness to test the `JP2KLib.dll` library.
*   The document provides a great deal of context for the CVE in the surrounding vulnerabilities found at the same time.

This information aligns with the general description of out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities and provides additional context regarding the specific software and library where this vulnerability exists.
