{
  "CVE-2018-12385": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. The `TransportSecurityInfo` class in the Mozilla codebase incorrectly deserializes cached data, leading to a use-after-free condition due to a raw pointer cast instead of querying for the interface.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect deserialization",
       "Improper type casting",
      "Improper handling of cached data",
      "Lack of proper interface checking"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo`. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, or a denial-of-service condition, especially when combined with another vulnerability which could allow an attacker to write malicious data to the local cache.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local Cache Manipulation",
	  "Profile Downgrading",
       "Malicious MAR file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need a secondary vulnerability to write malicious data into the local cache. Alternatively, malware installed locally on the system could also trigger the vulnerability. For the non-exploitable startup crash, the attacker just needs a profile from a more recent version of the browser."
