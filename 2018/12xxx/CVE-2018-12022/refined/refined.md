Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-12022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper polymorphic deserialization of types from the Jodd-db library within the `jackson-databind` library. This means that when Jackson attempts to deserialize data into Java objects, it doesn't correctly handle the types from the `jodd-db` library, leading to potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Polymorphic Deserialization:** The core weakness is the incorrect handling of polymorphic deserialization, specifically when dealing with types from the `jodd-db` library. This allows an attacker to potentially supply malicious data that will be interpreted and acted on in an unsafe manner.
*   **Serialization Gadget:** The `jodd-db` library contains classes that can act as "serialization gadgets," which can be exploited during deserialization to perform unintended actions such as remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If successfully exploited, this vulnerability can lead to RCE. By providing a specially crafted JSON payload that includes a malicious type from the `jodd-db` library, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although less prominent, the initial vulnerability description refers to content exfiltration (remote access by sending contents over ftp) and possible further attacks
*   **Data Modification or Denial of Service (DoS):** These are mentioned as a potential result of an exploit in general.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JSON Payload:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious JSON payload that contains a type from the `jodd-db` library that, when deserialized, triggers the vulnerable behavior.
*   **Default Typing:** The exploit typically requires the use of Jackson's default typing feature, which automatically includes type information during serialization and deserialization. This allows Jackson to instantiate arbitrary classes if not handled properly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Untrusted JSON Input:** The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary or crafted JSON data to a system that uses the vulnerable `jackson-databind` library.
*   **Target System with `jodd-db`:** The target system must have the `jodd-db` library on its classpath.
*   **Default Typing Enabled:** The target system must use `jackson-databind` with default typing enabled, or other similar polymorphic handling features.
*   **(Potentially) Network Access:** If exfiltration is the primary attack goal, network access to an untrusted system for command execution or access to an FTP server might be required.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   **Fix:** Patches for this vulnerability involve adding the vulnerable `jodd-db` classes to a blacklist to prevent their instantiation during deserialization. 
*   **Affected Products:** Various Red Hat products, including JBoss EAP, JBoss BRMS, Red Hat Process Automation Manager, Red Hat Fuse and OpenShift, are identified as affected and requiring updates, confirming widespread impact.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The upstream fix involves blacklisting the vulnerable class: `jodd.db.connection.DataSourceConnectionProvider`.
*   **Mitigation:** It is recommended to avoid using default typing in Jackson and to be explicit about which types are allowed for polymorphic deserialization. Avoid using java.lang.Object as the nominal type.
