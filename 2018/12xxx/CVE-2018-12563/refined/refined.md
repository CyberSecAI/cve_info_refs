- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lava-server-gunicorn` was using `urllib.request.urlopen`, which accepts any URL scheme, including `file://`. This allowed a user to force the server to download any file from the filesystem if it's readable by the `lavaserver` and is valid YAML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Arbitrary file read:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to read any file accessible to the `lavaserver` process.
    - **Insecure URL handling:** The use of `urllib.request.urlopen` without proper restrictions on URL schemes allowed for the file:// scheme to be used.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker provides a specially crafted URL using the `file://` scheme in the "include" section of a YAML configuration to be processed by `lava-server-gunicorn`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit jobs with custom YAML configurations to the vulnerable `lava-server-gunicorn`.
    - The attacker must have knowledge of a path on the server filesystem that is readable by the `lavaserver` user and contains valid YAML data.

The fix replaces `urllib.request.urlopen` with `requests.get`, which does not allow `file://` URLs, preventing the arbitrary file read vulnerability.
