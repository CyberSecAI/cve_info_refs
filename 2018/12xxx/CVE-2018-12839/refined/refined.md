Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12839:

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Acrobat and Reader
*   **Source:** Adobe Security Bulletin APSB18-30 and Checkpoint Research

**Summary of Vulnerability Details (from Checkpoint Research):**

The Checkpoint Research article, "50 CVEs in 50 Days: Fuzzing Adobe Reader," details how they discovered numerous vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-12839, in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro by using the WinAFL fuzzer. The article specifically discusses the process of reverse-engineering JP2KLib.dll (a JPEG2000 parser) and writing a harness to effectively target and fuzz the library. The OOB read vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vector:**

The attack vector involves exploiting a malformed JPEG2000 file processed by Adobe Acrobat or Reader. By crafting a specific input that triggers the out-of-bounds read, an attacker could potentially leak information.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Checkpoint Research team found 53 critical bugs in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro using their fuzzing strategy.
*   They also provided improvements to the WinAFL fuzzer, contributing patches for new features and bug fixes.
*   The research highlights the effectiveness of fuzzing in discovering vulnerabilities in complex software like Adobe Reader.
*   The Adobe Security Bulletin APSB18-30 confirms the vulnerability and provides update recommendations.
