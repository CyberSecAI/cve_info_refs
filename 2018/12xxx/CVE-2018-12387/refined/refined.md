{
  "CVE-2018-12387": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability where the JavaScript JIT compiler inlines Array.prototype.push with multiple arguments that results in the stack pointer being off by 8 bytes after a bailout. This leaks a memory address to the calling function which can be used as part of an exploit inside the sandboxed content process.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JavaScript JIT compiler incorrectly restores the call stack when inlining Array.prototype.push with multiple arguments, specifically when used with fun.call.  The stack pointer is left offset after a bailout, resulting in a memory leak.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect stack management",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Information leak which can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution within the sandboxed content process.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web page that triggers the vulnerability via JavaScript"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to entice the user to open a malicious webpage"
  }
