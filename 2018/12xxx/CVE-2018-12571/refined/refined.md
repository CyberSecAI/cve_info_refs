Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-12571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to how Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010 handles the `orig_url` parameter in the `InitParams.aspx` page. It allows remote attackers to provide a comma-separated list of URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate the URLs provided in the `orig_url` parameter.
- It triggers outbound DNS queries for arbitrary hosts specified in the `orig_url`.
- The vulnerability allows for an attacker to cause an amplification of traffic via the external DNS lookups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Traffic amplification:** By providing a list of URLs, an attacker can force the vulnerable system to perform multiple DNS lookups, potentially causing a traffic amplification effect.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The vulnerability can possibly be exploited to perform SSRF attacks by making the server make connections to internal/external resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `orig_url` parameter of the `InitParams.aspx` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010 server.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload in the `orig_url` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft, but it was determined that it did not meet the criteria for a security update and won't be patched.
- The provided proof of concept URL is:
