Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12872:

**Summary:**

*   CVE-2018-12872 is an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability affecting Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to **information disclosure**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the JP2KLib.dll library, which is used for parsing JPEG2000 images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software reads data beyond the intended buffer, leading to potential information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image. This could be embedded in a PDF file or other supported formats.
*   The attack vector is through a file format vulnerability when the application parses a malicious JPEG2000 image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to create or obtain a malicious JPEG2000 file that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   The attacker would need to get a user to open a PDF or other document containing the malicious image using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Checkpoint Research article describes how they used fuzzing to find over 50 vulnerabilities, including this one, by targeting specific parsers within Adobe Reader. They specifically targeted JP2KLib.dll, the JPEG2000 parser.
*   The Checkpoint research also details the process of reverse engineering and building a harness to fuzz the JPEG2000 parser.
*   The vulnerability is listed as "Important" severity in the Adobe Security Bulletin, due to the "Information Disclosure" impact.

This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities discovered by Check Point researchers through fuzzing Adobe Reader. The root cause is a parsing error in a binary format which can be exploited by crafting a specific file.
