# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602#c0)• 6 years ago |
|  | |

There are multiple TOCOU bugs in extension the scheduler of extension content scripts that allow extensions to run content scripts in principals that it should not have access to.
TOCTOU bug 1:
When an extension is just installed, or when a content process starts up,
injectExtensionScripts is called to run content scripts in existing pages.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/extension-process-script.js#202-221>
It first checks matchesWindow and then runs scripts in three batches, document\_start, document\_end and document\_idle. There is no guarantee that the inner window has not changed.
TOCTOU bug 2:
When a new document is loaded, ExtensionPolicyService::CheckContentScripts checks whether a script should run via script->Matches(aDocInfo), and then loads a script via loadContentScript:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionPolicyService.cpp#338-354>
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/extension-process-script.js#499-503>
The problem is that aDocInfo has a fixed value, while the document is not guaranteed to have a constant value.
TOCTOU bug 3:
When a dynamic content script is executed (via "Extension:Execute" message), there is no check that the extension is still valid (i.e. not disabled or reloaded). Consequently, it is possible for a dynamic content script to execute after having uninstalled an add-on.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionContent.jsm#865-876>
In short:
- TOCTOU bug 1 and 2 allows extensions to escalate privileges.
- TOCTOU 3 allows extensions to run code after an extension is disabled (any of these bug do).
Bug 1 was introduced in Firefox 57 by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ce17d1d232f1>
Bug 2 was introduced in Firefox 55 by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/32a3b7c39207>
ESR 52 is not affected (tested with 52.9), ESR 60 and current release branches are affected.

STR:
1. Load attached extension at about:debugging.
2. Visit example.com
3. A dialog appears. If the dialog is not automatically closed after the navigation completes, close the dialog.
4. Wait until the new navigation (addons.mozilla.org) has finished.
Expected:
= No additional dialogs.
Actual:
- Dialog with: "Managed to run script at <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/>
If you don't see the actual result, try navigating back to example.com (and refresh the page).

The first paragraph of the bug looks unintelligible. It should read:
> There are multiple time of check to time to use (TOCTOU) bugs in the scheduler of extension content scripts that allow an extension to run content scripts in principals that it should not have access to.Summary: TOCTOU enables extensions to run content scripts anywhere → Extensions can run content scripts anywhere when the document navigates during content script execution

I'm going to address the third bug as part of [bug 1346941](/show_bug.cgi?id=1346941 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - tabs.executeScript() 'frameId' and 'allFrames' are mutually exclusive"), because it has no significant security impact\* and the relevant code needs to be refactored anyway.
\* The third part of the bug is a race condition that allows extensions to run content scripts after an extension has shut down, but only in pages where extensions already had the permission to do so. Extensions already have this capability (they can simply inject a script in a web page).

This has been fixed on trunk by [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++"):
- "TOCTOU bug 1" fixed by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a7848dcb339e>
- "TOCTOU bug 2" fixed by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/eef3785a6b44>
(this second fix still leaves open one (non-security?) bug though: The second loop uses aDocInfo.GetWindow() again even though the inner window might have changed.).

Verified fixed in Firefox 63, buildID 20180827220123 .
I want to uplift a fix to Beta and ESR because the bug is easy to exploit and allows extensions to escalate privileges (and even run code on AMO).
The changes from [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++") are however too large for uplifting, so try a minimal fix such as [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Extensions can run content scripts anywhere when the document navigates during content script execution").

r=mixedpuppy at <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D3772> , but this r+ is somehow not mirrored here.
[ESR Uplift Approval Request]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: Privilege escalation in extensions; extensions can run code on any website.
User impact if declined: Extensions with minimal permissions can run JavaScript code on any website, even privileged websites such as addons.mozilla.org .
Fix Landed on Version: 63
Risk to taking this patch: Low
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): The cpp changes from the patch have already landed in 63 in [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++"). The JS-specific part has not, but its correctness was verified using the automated test in 63.

If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

## Security

### Red Hat Product Security

Red Hat believes that everyone, everywhere, is entitled to quality information needed to mitigate security and privacy risks, as well as the access to do so. We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-27

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.3

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

* [Bug 1495011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011)

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

##### References

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
low
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

* Firefox 63

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

#### [#CVE-2018-12398: CSP bypass through stylesheet injection in resource URIs](#CVE-2018-12398)

Reporter
cgvwzq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using the reflected URL in some special resource URIs, such as `chrome:`, it is possible to inject stylesheets and bypass Content Security Policy (CSP).

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
Björn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance, and portability.

* Mozilla: Crash with nested event loops (CVE-2018-12392)
* Mozilla: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript (CVE-2018-12393)
* Mozilla: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting (CVE-2018-12395)
* Mozilla: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts (CVE-2018-12396)
* Mozilla: WebExtension local file permission check bypass (CVE-2018-12397)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Attached file
[file-perm-nowarning.xpi](attachment.cgi?id=9005272)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9005272&action=edit)

When an extension requests the "file:///\*" permission, it gets access to local files, but there are no permission warnings (unlike "file://\*/\*", which has the "Access your data for all websites" warning).
1. Visit about:config and set xpinstall.signatures.required to false (requires Nightly or unbranded build).
2. Install the attached xpi file.
3. Visit a local file or directory in the browser.
Expected:
- At step 2, a warning should be displayed about the fact that extensions can access local files.
- At step 3, the local file should have a pink background (=extension ran script in the file).
(alternatively, depending on the resolution of [bug 1487353](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487353 "RESOLVED FIXED - Extensions can run content scripts in local files and read any other local file"), the local file should not be pink, and the warning at step 2 is not relevant)
Actual:
- At step 2, no warnings are displayed.

Screenshot taken at step 2 in Firefox Nightly (63). I also confirmed this bug in stable (61).
Compare this with the screenshot from [bug 1487353](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487353 "RESOLVED FIXED - Extensions can run content scripts in local files and read any other local file"), where the permission warning was actually displayed: <https://bug1487353.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=9005150>

"Unparseable host permission file:///\*" appears in the global console when the installation doorhanger is shown. Reminds me of [bug 1426363](/show_bug.cgi?id=1426363 "VERIFIED FIXED - Host permissions with scheme wildcard (*://...) are not shown in permissions doorhangers") ...

I scanned AMO and found:
- 164 extensions use "file:///" in permissions, optional\_permissions or content\_scripts[\*].matches.
- 7 extensions don't have "<all\_urls>", "[https://\*/](https://*/)\*", "[http://\*/](http://*/)\*" or "\*://\*/\*" in permissions or content\_scripts[\*].matches.
Fixing this bug would result in an additional "Access your data for all websites" warning for new installations of these 7 add-ons that are listed on AMO (AMO file IDs: 854766 866049 876007 872569 909653 940036 975288 ).

All branches are affected.
This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings.
Extensions cannot navigate to file:-URLs themselves, so in order to exploit this, a user needs to:
- Install an extension that exploits this vulnerability.
- Open a local file in the browser.
The impact can be improved even more when combined with [bug 1487353](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487353 "RESOLVED FIXED - Extensions can run content scripts in local files and read any other local file").
I'd therefore rate this as follows:

Andrew, in <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D4707#156518> you said:

Do you still believe that it's true, given [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"file:///*\" extension permission has no warning") ?

Should this patch be uplifted to Beta and ESR? I believe so given the low risk of the patch and the impact (see [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"file:///*\" extension permission has no warning")), but I'd like a confirmation given [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"file:///*\" extension permission has no warning").Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

0001-Bug-1487478-Move-MatchPattern-normalization-into-cla.patch
Automated tests are not checked in yet, but I added extensive test coverage in the patch at [bug 1484263](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484263 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clean up mozillaAddons permission parsing logic in _parseManifest").
The exact scenario that triggered this bug has not been added yet; I can either delay that other patch or add a test case later as a part of this bug.
