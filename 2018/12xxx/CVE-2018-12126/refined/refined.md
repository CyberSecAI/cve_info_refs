Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2018-12126 lies in the microarchitectural design of modern Intel microprocessors. Specifically, the way these processors handle write operations to CPU caches using separate Store Address (STA) and Store Data (STD) sub-operations which use a shared 'processor store buffer' and may allow speculative forwarding of stale data which can be leaked via side-channel analysis. The store buffer entries are divided between hyper-threads and under specific conditions, e.g. power-state change can reallocate partially-updated entries to another thread leading to data exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS):** The vulnerability is a result of the design where the processor may speculatively forward entries from the store buffer using stale data, allowing attackers to potentially leak data from the processor's store buffer by manipulating memory access via a side-channel attack.
*   **Data Leakage through Side-Channel Analysis:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to infer data by measuring the response time of load operations that speculatively use stale values in the processor store buffer. The shared processor store buffer can contain private data leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage this flaw to read sensitive data from the processor's store buffer, potentially exposing confidential information residing in the CPU cache.
*   **Privilege Escalation (in some contexts):** In some cases, this information leakage could lead to privilege escalation if the leaked data contains secrets or credentials.
*   **Denial of Service (in some cases):** While not the main impact for this CVE, some of the resources mention the possibility of a Denial of Service if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attack requires local access to the targeted system, implying the attacker needs to be able to execute code on the vulnerable machine.
*   **Side-channel Timing Analysis:** The exploit relies on the attacker's ability to perform precise timing analysis of load operations to determine which data is being accessed in the processor store buffer, which is not persistent on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the targeted system, which could be a virtual machine, application or the operating system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute specifically crafted code designed to leak the required data via the side channel.
*   **Timing Analysis Skills:** The attacker needs technical skill in analyzing the timing variations to expose the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description)**

*   **Mitigations:** The provided content outlines mitigations such as updating the processor microcode and disabling Hyper-Threading on systems with different trust domains. In the absence of updated microcode, MDS mitigation can be enabled via  `sysctl hw.mds_disable=1` in FreeBSD (11.3, 12.1 or later).
*   **Impact of Mitigations:** Disabling Hyper-Threading or enabling MDS mitigations can result in a performance impact.
*   **Affected Products:** As mentioned in the provided advisories, a wide range of Intel products including servers, virtual machines, desktops and embedded systems can be affected.
