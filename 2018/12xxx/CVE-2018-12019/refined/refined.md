### Root cause of vulnerability
The signature verification routine in Enigmail incorrectly interprets User IDs as status/control messages and does not correctly track the status of multiple signatures.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Improper verification of cryptographic signatures.
- The software interprets User IDs as status/control messages, leading to confusion in signature verification logic.
- Incorrect handling of multiple signatures, which could lead to spoofing.

### Impact of exploitation
Remote attackers can spoof arbitrary email signatures via public keys containing crafted primary user ids.

### Attack vectors
- Crafted primary user IDs within public keys.
- An attacker crafts a malicious email and forges the signature to appear as if it is from a trusted sender

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious public key containing crafted primary user ids.
- The attacker requires a basic understanding of email structure, OpenPGP, and how Enigmail processes signatures.
- No special position or access to the victim's system is required.
