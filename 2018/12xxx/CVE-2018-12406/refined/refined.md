Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12406

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of multiple memory safety bugs present in Firefox 63, which were identified by Mozilla developers and community members.  These bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, indicating a risk of arbitrary code execution upon successful exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory safety bugs leading to memory corruption.
  - The specific nature of each memory safety bug is not detailed in this document, but they are described as causing memory corruption and a risk of arbitrary code execution.
  - The provided bug list links to a list of resolved bugs, which might contain specifics, but are not included in this document.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution. Exploitation could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the user's system.
  - Denial of service (DoS) is also a possible impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The bugs can be triggered by opening a specially crafted or malicious website.
- The exact method of triggering is not described here but relates to memory safety issues, indicating a level of complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious website using Firefox 63, or potentially earlier versions if they are affected by these memory safety issues.
- The attacker requires the ability to craft an exploit that leverages the memory corruption to achieve code execution.

**Additional Details**

*   The provided bugzilla entry for Bug 1507702 (related to CVE-2018-18510, a separate issue) clarifies that the `about:crashcontent` and `about:crashparent` debugging pages can be triggered by web content. The vulnerability for CVE-2018-18510 was a denial of service, which is different from the arbitrary code execution vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12406. Bug 1507702 was fixed in Firefox 64 by restricting access to the crash URLs from web content.

*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3844-1) references CVE-2018-12406 as part of a list of vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 64. It states that an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code if a user was tricked into visiting a malicious website.

**Summary**

CVE-2018-12406 is a critical vulnerability due to multiple memory safety bugs in Firefox 63 that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could exploit these bugs by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were included in Firefox 64.
