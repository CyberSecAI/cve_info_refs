# USN-3844-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

11 December 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass same-origin

restritions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12405](/security/CVE-2018-12405), [CVE-2018-12406](/security/CVE-2018-12406),

[CVE-2018-12407](/security/CVE-2018-12407), [CVE-2018-17466](/security/CVE-2018-17466), [CVE-2018-18492](/security/CVE-2018-18492), [CVE-2018-18493](/security/CVE-2018-18493),

[CVE-2018-18494](/security/CVE-2018-18494), [CVE-2018-18498](/security/CVE-2018-18498))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to open privileged pages, or bypass other

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-18495](/security/CVE-2018-18495), [CVE-2018-18497](/security/CVE-2018-18497))

The firefox special URL "about:crashcontent" will trigger a crash of the current tab for testing purposes.
It is possible to trigger that URL from within a webpage, e.g. via an <img> tag. This also extends to being able to crash a browser from within an iframe, which I believe is particularly problematic as iframes are often used to embed content that a site not necessarily trusts.
(For a practical example look at <https://twitter.com/xsamaster/status/1063347833271713792> - a tweet that embeds a "video" that will crash the browser tab.)
I believe a special debugging feature URL like about:crashcontent should never be accessible from a webpage, it should only be possible to activate it if the user actually types in that URL.

Wow, thank you for reporting this. It gets even worse, you can crash the entire browser with data:text/html,<link rel="icon" href="about:crashparent"/>, so that means any web content can trivially trigger it.
Combined with other issues (e.g. gaming frecency to become a top site) this can be catastrophic.
Snorp, we should not have about:crashparent in the first place. I remember a proposal for having an about:restart page being denied in an email discussion based on the effort we would have to go through to avoid loopholes that cause web content to load it. Even if we fix this issue IMO the risk is too high to keep it.
I'm less sure about about:crashcontent, though my vote would be for removing it as well.
Considering that this is a tweet already, we might need to act fast before someone discovers about:crashparent...

I'm deleting the tweet + the loaded code for now. (I didn't think a lot about creating this, this is a test account from me, I doubt anyone knows about it publicly.)
I'd also like to voice my opinion that I absolutely think this is a useful feature and should \*not\* be removed. I wish I knew about it, then I could've found #1507142 sooner. However I think it might be an idea to put it behind a flag that comes with a warning that this should only be used for debugging.

At a minimum, this should have been nightly/testing-only, maybe mobile-only if that's what it's for, and it should have been tested thoroughly to make sure web content couldn't trip it in any way. I'm not sure if just removing URI\_SAFE\_FOR\_UNTRUSTED\_CONTENT is enough here, given the way the implementation is done (ie in NewChannel, rather than when the content of the URI actually loads).Flags: needinfo?(ehsan)

I agree that web content shouldn't be able to trigger this, but I disagree about this being e.g. mobile-only. this feature is required to test automation across different platforms.
If possible, we should make it such that it cannot be loaded as a resource and not redirected to. But I don't know if that is easily doable.

If we need it just for testing automation, can we make it only available when MOZ\_AUTOMATION / Cu.isInAutomation is true?Flags: needinfo?(choller)

Fundamentally this is also a replacement for the "Crash me now" extension that stopped working when we dropped support for non-web extensions. Being able to test our crash reporting pipeline is pretty important. If we disable these URLs then we should figure out a path to support something like that extension again. rhelmer had a prototype web extension + experiment but we had a hard time getting people on board with shipping it: <https://github.com/rhelmer/webext-experiment-crashme/>

Yes, I believe going for this and/or a set of prefs is the right approach. Johann also proposed this. In Fuzzing, I don't think we have Cu.isInAutomation set, but we do have a fuzzing pref and FUZZING builds. So it is certainly possible to tie this to some pref/env variables.Flags: needinfo?(choller)

Well, we can probably/hopefully enforce that the channel is a toplevel document load as well... belt and suspenders and all that.

Ugh, what a mess. I would prefer a solution that doesn't require prefs, if doable. GeckoView consumers don't have a direct way of setting prefs and they also want to be able to test crash reporting since there is some downstream stuff that they need to implement.
My preference is to restrict this to toplevel, user-entered loads if possible. It looks like we should be able to ensure it's a toplevel load by checking `nsILoadInfo::loadingDocument` in `nsAboutRedirector::NewChannel`, but I'm not sure about the user-entered part. I thought we had some flags for that, but I guess they're not present in nsILoadInfo? The comments in nsAboutModule.idl indicate you need MAKE\_LINKABLE to allow links from content, so maybe checking for toplevel is enough?Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

Unlikely we'll fix this in 63 at this point, but we should definitely do something for 64+.

Can those consumers not set the right env vars to trip Cu.isInAutomation? Otherwise, could geckoview expose an API that consumers can call to toggle this functionality on/off? (ni for this)

You can check for triggering principal == system principal, I guess, but I'm not aware of us having anything that \*actually\* means user-entered.

I don't think that alone is enough, given that this exploit uses <iframe> or <video> or <img> sourcing. From just checking a data:text/html,<img src=about:crashcontent>, apparently we first create the channel and then do security checks on that channel (from inside AsyncOpen). In which case, the implementation of the crash may need to move out of NewChannel so the crash only happens \*after\* the security checks instead of \*before\*.

I don't see that anyone has mentioned it yet but for the record--these are safe crashes that are not exploitable. This is simply a DoS vector.

We could, but it's a PITA. It's just that much more work that every app needs to duplicate. If it comes to this, fine, but avoiding would be preferable.

The patch + test seems to be working for these cases, but I could be missing something there. I would definitely appreciate an expert opinion.

Right, so currently whenever we create a new Channel the NewChannel() implementation, for this case in particular [1] is run before we open the channel. In other words, no security have been performed at that point. I think it makes sense to move that code [1] somewhere else. A common point would be the ContentSecurityManager after all the security checks have performed, somewhere at the end of DoContentSecurityChecks().
Alternatively, probably better, we could move it to the right ::asyncOpen2() implementation and put it there after the security checks have been performed. I think about channels call nsBaseChannel::AsyncOpen2() [2].
Additionally, as Gijs suggested, I think it makes sense to not ship that code in release. We should use |#ifdef debug| or something similar.

Oh, one last note that might be of importance. Do we want to allow that crash to be triggered by web content? E.g. for testing purposes? The right way to figure that out is by inspecting the TriggeringPrincipal within the LoadInfo. Calling |triggeringPrincipal->GetIsCodebasePrincipal()| would reveal that information if needed.

I just checked this in nightly and I don't think this is fully fixed.
The <img src="about:crashcontent"> no longer works, but the example from [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1507702#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"about:crashcontent\" and \"about:crashparent\" can be triggered from web content") - <link rel="icon" href="about:crashparent"/> - still crashes nightly.

Thanks for pointing this out. We should deal with this in a separate bug. I filed [bug 1511903](/show_bug.cgi?id=1511903 "VERIFIED FIXED - about:crashparent as a favicon still crashes nightly").

Accessing "about:crashcontent" in the latest Firefox Nightly and Firefox beta displays "Gah. Your tab just crashed." with the options to "Close Tab" or "Restore This tab" without closing Firefox.
But accessing "about:crashparent" crashes Firefox and close Firefox.
I'm not sure if this is the desired behavior here. Could you please clarify this to me?Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

Accessing these URIs via the location bar should do as you described. This patch prevents web content from loading them (as resources, etc).Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

I don't know what the qualifications are to wind up in that advisory, but this was only a denial of service, there's no security impact.

> This wasn't mentioned in the security advisory for Firefox 64:

That's a better question addressed to security@ mail, not buried in this bug which the people writing advisories obviously somehow missed (which is probably why it didn't have an advisory in the first place). RC2 of a release ([comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1507702#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"about:crashcontent\" and \"about:crashparent\" can be triggered from web content")) is typically after we've done the advisories and no one let us know.

New about: pages, especially web-accessible ones, really ought to have had a security review.
