Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the Android FTP Server application does not disable the clipboard functionality for input fields that handle sensitive data, such as the "User password" field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Clipboard Data Exposure:** The application allows users to copy sensitive data (passwords) entered in the application to the clipboard.
- **Lack of Clipboard Protection:** The application does not implement any measures to prevent other applications from accessing the clipboard data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** A malicious application on the same device can access the clipboard and steal the sensitive information, such as FTP server user passwords, that were copied. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the FTP server and the user's files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application installed on the same Android device as the FTP server app can access the shared clipboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the same Android device as the vulnerable FTP server app.
- The user of the FTP server app must have copied sensitive information to the clipboard.

**Technical Details:**
The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using the `drozer` framework:

1.  The user sets a password within the FTP server app in the "User password" field.
2.  The user copies this password to the clipboard (by standard Android functionality).
3.  The attacker uses the `drozer` module `post.capture.clipboard` to read the copied password from the clipboard.

The description mentions that the clipboard is shared among apps on the device, which is how an attacker's app could access this information.
