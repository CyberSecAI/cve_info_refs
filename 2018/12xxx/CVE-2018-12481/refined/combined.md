## About this app

*arrow\_forward*Read/write any folder, including sdcard, in your android device with this ftp server. You can backup your photos to your PC, copy music and movies to your device, etc.

If you still do not have a ftp client I recommend FileZilla client (you can download it on http://filezilla-project.org/) but you can also use file explorer on windows.

Free version does not allow landscape screen.

Features:

Use any network interface in your device including: WIFI, Ethernet, Mobile network, USB...
Anonymous user (can be disabled).
One Ftp user (can be disabled). Name and password can be changed.
Home directory can be root directory,
Read only mode.
Passive and active modes.
Show hidden files.
Custom home folder.
Option to run server as a foreground service.
Energy save mode.
Languages supported: English, Spanish, Romanian, French, Italian, Hungarian, German, Chinese, Portuguese, Korean, Russian and Catalan.
Intents:
 com.theolivetree.ftpserver.StartFtpServer
 com.theolivetree.ftpserver.StopFtpServer

TODO:

Run server as root user (only rooted devices).
TLS/SSL support for secure connections.

How to connect with Ftp server using USB cable:

This can useful when you have USB cable and not network available.
1) On your phone go to Settings->Applications->Development and set option "USB debugging".
2) Connect your phone to your PC using USB cable.
3) Start adb server. On your PC run command "adb start-server".
 adb is a program that you can find on android sdk. Usually you will find it on android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.
4) Forward needed ports from your PC to your phone. On your PC run command "adb forward tcp:2221 tcp:2221"
 You will need to repeat this step for all ftp server and passive ports configured in your phone. It will be easier if you use a small range of passive ports.
 With this, any connection in your pc to 127.0.0.1:2221 will be forwarded to your phone in port 2221.
5) Run Ftp server in your phone, open settings and in "Network interfaces" select "Loopback (127.0.0.1)" or "All"
6) Start ftp server.
7) In your PC connect your ftp client to ftp://127.0.0.1:2221 (port might be different, it depends on your Ftp Server configuration).

Connections in this mode need to be always started by PC so only passive mode is available when using USB connection.

Permissions needed:

INTERNET
ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE
ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE

Network permission to enable server to open network communication with ftp clients.

WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE

Enables ftp server write received files from ftp clients on sdcard.

WAKE\_LOCK

Keeps phone wake only while server is running. If phone is not wake connections to ftp server can fail.

September 26, 2018It works well and instantly. I can now access, copy and delete my phone files and folders on the phone SDCard wireless, using any FTP client. Most easy use the windows 8 or higher on board file explorer, or and FTP client you like more on your PC or Mac or Linux. Negative: I can not so quickly switch between phone internal storage and external storage. For this I have to configure the FTP Server again any time when I want to switch.31 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EGemoI2NTXmTsBVtJqk8jxF9rh8ApRWfsIMQSt2uE4OcpQqbFu7f7NbTK05lx80nuSijCz7sc3a277R67g=s32-rw)A Google user*more\_vert*

April 12, 2019Works perfectly and instantly, no disconnecting, no annoying error messages. Now I can look at my phone in Total Commander just like it's a drive in the computer (only slower of course :) - but the app does yield the wi-fi maximum of 50 mbit). Update1: After the initial perfect operation however, it eventually started to glitch and even disconnect. Update2: My bad, it was my Android, did the very same thing with a completely different app (http server). Rebooting the phone solved the issue.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
