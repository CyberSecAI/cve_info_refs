Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs due to a flaw in how the software processes specific data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer or data structure, causing a read past the boundary and potentially causing information disclosure or leading to other vulnerabilities being exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive information from memory. This leaked information can potentially be used in further attacks or gaining knowledge about the target system.
*   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the direct impact listed is information disclosure, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector is not detailed, but based on the research, the vulnerability is triggered when processing malformed JPEG2000 data, typically embedded in a PDF. An attacker would need to craft a malicious JPEG2000 image file (likely within a PDF) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to get a user to open a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
*   No special privileges are needed to exploit this, as the vulnerability occurs in user-level code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered as part of a fuzzing campaign, where the researchers used WinAFL to test Adobe Reader and found 53 bugs. This indicates that the vulnerability could be triggered by a wide variety of inputs that produce unexpected behavior in the parsing of the JPEG2000 data.
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat and Reader on both Windows and macOS.
*   The fix for this issue is to update to the patched versions of the software.
*   The vulnerability was found in the `JP2KLib.dll` library, which is used for handling JPEG2000 images in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   The research focused on developing a harness to target specific parsers in Adobe products, which is a technique that could be applied to other applications.

The provided content gives more detail on the research methodology used to discover the vulnerability, as well as the process of reverse engineering and writing harnesses for fuzzing Adobe Reader using WinAFL. The CVE description itself is quite sparse, but the linked content provides more insight into the nature of the vulnerability and how it was found.
