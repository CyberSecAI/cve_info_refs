Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12799

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an **untrusted pointer dereference**. This means the software is attempting to access a memory location using a pointer that may not be valid or may point to an attacker-controlled area.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Untrusted pointer dereference:** This is the core vulnerability, where the program uses a pointer without proper validation, potentially leading to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to **arbitrary code execution**. This means an attacker can run malicious code on the victim's system with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is not explicitly detailed in this document but, given the context of Adobe Acrobat and Reader, it's likely that the vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted PDF document that exploits the untrusted pointer dereference during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim. This could be done through various means such as email, malicious websites, or other file-sharing methods.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to craft the malicious PDF to exploit the untrusted pointer dereference.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader for both Windows and macOS.
*   Adobe has issued updates to address the vulnerability. It's recommended that users upgrade to the latest versions as outlined in the advisory.
*   This vulnerability is categorized as "Critical" due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Abdul Aziz Hariri of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
