Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12912

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `EmptyTable` function in `admin\controllers\database.php` which directly uses a user-supplied `$tablename` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Because the `$tablename` parameter is directly inserted into the SQL DELETE query, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to various impacts like data exfiltration, data modification, or even complete database compromise.
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided proof of concept shows that an attacker can use `updatexml` to extract the database version. This can be leveraged to gather more sensitive database information.
- **Data Deletion:**  While the intended function is to empty tables, the injected SQL could lead to deletion of data from tables other than the intended one, if not used for information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/admin/index.php/database/operate` endpoint with the `dbaction` parameter set to `emptytable` and the `tablename` parameter containing the malicious SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Privilege:** The exploit requires administrator-level access to the HongCMS system, because access to the admin panel is needed to perform this action. The provided POC mentions "Administrator Privilege".
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application to send the malicious HTTP request.
