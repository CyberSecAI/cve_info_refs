Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-12766:

**Summary:**

*   CVE-2018-12766 is an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability found in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to **information disclosure**.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the application's memory. This could potentially expose user data or internal program details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves the processing of a specially crafted file, presumably a PDF or a related image format (JPEG2000 as indicated in the Checkpoint research).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious PDF.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, a method of automated software testing that involves providing malformed inputs to an application to identify crashes and potential vulnerabilities.
*   The Check Point Research document details the process of fuzzing Adobe Reader using WinAFL, including how they created a harness for the JP2KLib.dll library which is responsible for JPEG2000 image parsing. This shows that the vulnerability could be present in the way JPEG2000 images are processed.
* The Check Point Research document mentions the vulnerability was found by Netanel Ben Simon and Yoav Alon from Check Point Software Technologies.
