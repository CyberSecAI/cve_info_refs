- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection vulnerability in portfolioCMS
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `preview` parameter within `portfolio.php` file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted GET request to `admin/portfolio.php` with a malicious payload in the `preview` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and has knowledge of SQL syntax. The attacker needs to be able to access the admin/portfolio.php file.
