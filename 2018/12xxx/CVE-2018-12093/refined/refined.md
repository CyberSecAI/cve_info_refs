Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-12093:

**Summary:**

The provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in the `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` function within the `tinyexr` library. This was reported by a user named ChijinZ, who used clang and leak sanitizer to discover the issue.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` function, specifically at `tinyexr.h:11101:16`, allocates memory using `strdup`. However, this memory is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak due to the use of `strdup` without a corresponding `free`. This occurs within the `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` function when parsing the EXR header from memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Repeatedly processing crafted EXR files with the vulnerable code could lead to memory exhaustion, potentially causing denial of service or other unexpected behavior of applications using the library.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted EXR file to the `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` function, either directly or indirectly through another function that utilizes it, such as `ParseEXRHeaderFromFile`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable code with a crafted EXR file and trigger parsing of the header.

**Technical Details:**

- The issue was detected using clang and leak sanitizer, pinpointing the `strdup` allocation within `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` as the source of the leak. The leak was specifically identified as a "direct leak" of 30 bytes.
- The call stack provided in the issue report confirms the leak originates from `strdup` inside `ParseEXRHeaderFromMemory` called by `ParseEXRHeaderFromFile`.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue report includes a commit ID (`6fd0c1f7575b9119f287fbe5577b2eff41c71bd5`) that may indicate where the vulnerable code was introduced.
- A test case file (`tinyexr_6fd0c1f/memory_leak`) provided by the reporter is available to reproduce the memory leak.

This issue provides more details than the typical CVE description, including the exact function and code location involved, the nature of the memory leak (direct leak via strdup), the tools used to detect the leak and the impact.
