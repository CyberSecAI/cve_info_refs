The provided content is related to CVE-2018-12471.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML External Entities (XXE) within the RegistrationSharing module of the Subscription Management Tool (SMT). The `_getXMLFromPostData` subroutine parses XML data from POST requests and uses the Perl LibXML library, which by default allows external entities to be loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The code parses XML from POST data without disabling external entity processing, leading to XXE vulnerability.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Due to reflection point that echos back the entire XML document when no table name is specified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server by injecting specially crafted XML payloads with external entity references.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a DoS by sending a malicious XML payload, exploiting the processing of external entities.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** It is mentioned that it is possible to achieve SSRF as part of this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted XML payload within a POST request to the `shareregistration` command of the SMT web service. Specifically to `http://<smt_url>/center/regsvc?command=shareregistration`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the SMT server's web service.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
