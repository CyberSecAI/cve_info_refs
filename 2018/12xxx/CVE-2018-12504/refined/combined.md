## Heap Buffer overflow in LoadEXRImageFromMemory (**CVE-2018-12503**)

I build tinyexr with clang and address sanitizer. When testcase (see: <https://github.com/ChijinZ/security_advisories/blob/master/tinyexr_b53a457/heap-buffer-overflow>) is input into test\_tinyexr (command: ./test\_tinyexr testcase), a heap-buffer-overflow has triggered.

[![@ChijinZ](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32416157?u=bcc631450b392a2c58d257235f63be928dea6968&v=4&size=48)](/ChijinZ)[ChijinZ](https://github.com/ChijinZ)opened [on Jun 16, 2018](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/issues/82#issue-332980898)

When testcase (see: <https://github.com/ChijinZ/security_advisories/blob/master/tinyexr_b53a457/assert_10195>) is input into test\_tinyexr (command: ./test\_tinyexr testcase), a assert-failure problem is triggered in tinyexr.h:10195.

```
test_tinyexr: ./tinyexr.h:10195: void tinyexr::ComputeChannelLayout(std::vector<size_t> *, int *, size_t *, int, const EXRChannelInfo *): Assertion `0' failed.
Aborted
