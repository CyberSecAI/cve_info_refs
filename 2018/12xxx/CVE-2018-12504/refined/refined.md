Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-12504:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by an assertion failure within the `ComputeChannelLayout` function in `tinyexr.h` at line 10195.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code contains an assertion that can be triggered by crafted input. When the assertion fails, the program aborts. This indicates a logic error in handling specific EXR channel layouts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). When a malicious or malformed EXR file triggers the assertion, the application crashes. This could disrupt normal operations of programs utilizing the tinyexr library.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted EXR file that, when loaded, leads to the assertion failure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted EXR file to an application using the vulnerable version of `tinyexr`. This could be via a file upload, network file access, or any other method where the application processes an attacker-controlled EXR file. The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the system. They just need to provide the crafted input.
