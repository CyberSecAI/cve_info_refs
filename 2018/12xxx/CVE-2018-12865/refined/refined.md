Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds write** issue. Specifically, it arises during the parsing of JPEG2000 images within the `JP2KLib.dll` library used by Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The core weakness is that the software attempts to write data outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This can overwrite memory that is used for other purposes, leading to crashes and potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this out-of-bounds write vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker can take control of the affected system, potentially installing malware, stealing data, or performing other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF files:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious PDF documents that contain specially crafted JPEG2000 images. When Adobe Reader or Acrobat attempts to parse these images, the vulnerability is triggered.
*   **File Format Parsing:** The vulnerability specifically resides in the JPEG2000 parsing logic within the `JP2KLib.dll` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious PDF Documents:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify PDF files to include the malicious JPEG2000 content that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to open the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Reader or Acrobat.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, a technique used to find bugs by feeding software with malformed or unexpected input.
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader for both Windows and MacOS platforms.
* This vulnerability was part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found by Check Point Research, which identified over 50 vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader within a 50-day period.
*  Adobe assigned a "Critical" severity rating to this vulnerability due to the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
* The vulnerability was patched in later versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
