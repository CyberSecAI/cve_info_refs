Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12864:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The identified weakness is an out-of-bounds write. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted file, likely a PDF, that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by Adobe Acrobat or Reader. The vulnerability is within the handling of the JPEG2000 image format, specifically in the `JP2KLib.dll`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious file that exploits the out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The user would need to open this file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
* The attacker would require the ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided text also describes the methodology used to discover the vulnerability, which involved fuzzing (automated testing with mutated inputs) the `JP2KLib.dll` library. This suggests the vulnerability is related to parsing the JPEG2000 format.
*   The vulnerability is one of a number of vulnerabilities found using the described fuzzing techniques. The document lists multiple CVEs relating to similar vulnerabilities.
