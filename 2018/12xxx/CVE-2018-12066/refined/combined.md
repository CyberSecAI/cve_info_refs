### Filter: make bgpmask literals real constructors

```

The bgpmask literals can include expressions. This is OK but they have
to be interpreted as soon as the code is run, not in the time the code
is used as value.

This led to strange behavior like rewriting bgpmasks when they shan't
be rewritten:

	function mask_generator(int as)
	{
		return [= * as * =];
	}

	function another()
	bgpmask m1;
	bgpmask m2;
	{
		m1 = mask_generator(10);
		m2 = mask_generator(20);
		if (m1 == m2) {
			print("strange"); # this would happen
		}
	}

Moreover, sending this to CLI would cause stack overflow and knock down the
whole BIRD, as soon as there is at least one route to execute the given
filter on.

	show route filter bgpmask mmm; bgppath ppp; { ppp = +empty+; mmm = [= (ppp ~ mmm) =]; print(mmm); accept; }

The magic match operator (~) inside the bgpmask literal would try to
resolve mmm, which points to the same bgpmask so it would resolve
itself, call the magic match operator and vice versa.

After this patch, the bgpmask literal will get resolved as soon as it's
assigned to mmm and it also will return a type error as bool is not
convertible to ASN in BIRD.

Subject: Security vulnerability: Stack overflow in BGP mask expressions
Date: Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:37:04 +0200
```
Source: bird
Version: 1.6.3-2
Severity: critical
Tags: security

According to the upstream website[1] and changelog[2], bird release 1.6.4
includes an "important security bugfix".

The changelog mentions "Filter: Fixed stack overflow in BGP mask
expressions". A quick scan through the git history revealed a few
commits that mention overflow and use after free fixes:

e8bc64e308586b6502090da2775af84cd760ed0d
	Filter: make bgpmask literals real constructors
30c734fc73648e4c43af4f45e68ac2de3d7ddea1
	Static: Fix bug in static route filter expressions

Probably the best is to ask upstream about security relevant commits and
consider to either backport them to stretch-backports. Another option
would be to upload 1.6.4 to stretch-security as 1.6.4-0+deb9u1.

Hi

It is an security bugfix, but perhaps not so critical, it can be
exploited in very specific circumstances and probably only as a DoS,
not as a privilege escalation.

This is the relevant commit. It would not cleanly apply to 1.6.3, but i
can prepare patch for 1.6.3. But i don't know Debian processes, i.e.
what should be done to make security release.

This is not security related, but it is important bugfix and trivial to be
sure it does not cause further problems, so could be probably added too.
I could probably find some more similar bugfixes.

Packing 1.6.4 to stretch-security is probably not a good idea, there are
too many changes and new features.

I'm not familiar with bird, so we could use help insight to assess the
scope of the issue:

Could you please elaborate what these circumstances are? Like, who's
able to trigger a crash, does it affect only specific setups/conditions?

Cheers,

The crash could be triggered from bird CLI tool (birdc), which is usually
accessible only to administrator. But the birdc has 'restricted' mode
(when called with -r option) when the CLI is restricted to 'safe'
commands, just for inspecting BIRD state, but the crash could be
triggered even in the restricted mode. But even the restricted mode is
accessible only to administrator.

But if administrator would allow nonprivileged users to run birdc in
restricted mode (say using 'sudo' rules) assuming than it is safe, then
such assumption is broken by the bug.

# The BIRD Internet Routing Daemon

**The BIRD** project aims to develop a fully functional dynamic IP routing daemon
primarily targeted on (but not limited to) Linux, FreeBSD and other UNIX-like systems and distributed
under the [GNU General
Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html).

10.1.2025 - New release 3.0.1 and 2.16.1! Bugfixing releases

What do we support:

* Both IPv4 and IPv6
* Multiple routing tables
* BGP
* RIP
* OSPF
* BFD
* Babel
* Static routes
* IPv6 Router Advertisements
* Inter-table protocol
* Command-line interface (using the `birdc' client; to get
  some help, just press `?')
* Powerful language for route filtering
* Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD ports

**BIRD** was developed as a school project at [Faculty
of Math and Physics](http://www.mff.cuni.cz/), [Charles University](http://www.cuni.cz/) Prague.
Currently it is developed and supported by [CZ.NIC Labs](http://labs.nic.cz).
Current **BIRD** team members are:

* [Ondřej Filip](http://feela.network.cz/) (OSPF, BSD port, releases, packaging)
* [Martin Mareš](http://mj.ucw.cz/) (overall architecture, core, dumps, BGP)
* [Ondřej Zajíček](http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~zajio1am/) (New BGP features, OSPFv3, BFD)
* [Maria Matějka](http://mq.ucw.cz/) (MPLS, filters, multithreading)

Former **BIRD** team members were
[Libor Forst](http://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~forst/) and
[Pavel Machek](http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/).
