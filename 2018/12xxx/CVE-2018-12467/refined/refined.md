Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks in the `InitializeDevelPackage` attribute within the openSUSE Build Service (OBS). Specifically, when a submit action was performed involving project links, the system incorrectly checked permissions on the linked package instead of the actual source package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Check:** The core issue was that the code, when processing a submit action, was following project links and checking permissions on the package in the linked project rather than the source project.
*   **Bypass of Access Control:** This could potentially allow a user without permissions on the source project to initiate actions (like creating a development branch) that they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Potential for Artificial Requests:** The initial code didn't require the existence of source package in source project and potentially broke artificial requests (e.g., where the submit action that should create the package is not preceded by the action that checks permissions)
*   **Insufficient Fix:** This bug report notes that it was a follow-up to a previous fix for a related vulnerability (CVE-2018-7689), suggesting that the initial fix was incomplete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Package Modification:** An attacker could potentially manipulate packages by bypassing intended access controls. They could potentially create branches in a project they would otherwise not have the right to modify.
*   **Possible Data Integrity Issues:** Depending on the specific actions performed after permission bypass, this could lead to unintended alterations of the software build processes and the resulting software artifacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Submit Actions:** An attacker would need to create a malicious "submit" action within OBS.
*   **Project Links:** The attacker would need to use a project with a project link involved in the source project.
*   **Specific OBS Configurations:** The vulnerability is specific to the way project links and the `InitializeDevelPackage` attribute are handled in OBS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **OBS User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account in the OBS system.
*   **Understanding of OBS API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the OBS API to construct a malicious submit action.
*  **Knowledge of Project Links:** The attacker needs to be aware of how project links are configured to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved explicitly checking the source package in the source project without following project links.
*   The commit message notes that, at the time, the old code hadn't been successfully exploited, making the patch more of a proactive measure to avoid a potential future headache.
*   The patch also includes a secondary fix to avoid a different potential issue by ignoring a project link in the `BsRequestAction.check_action_permission!`
*   The patch has been integrated into OBS:Server:2.9 and was released.
*   A patch "0001-frontend-Recheck-permissions-in-the-InitializeDevelP.patch" was created to address the vulnerability.
