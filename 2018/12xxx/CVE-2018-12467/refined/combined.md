| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1100217#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-07-05 11:46:40 UTC  ``` via security@  Hi,  it turns out that the fix for [bsc#1094819](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1094819) ("(CVE-2018-7689) VUL-0: CVE-2018-7689: obs: InitializeDevelPackage attribute exploit (obs-api)") is insufficient. For the details, have a look at the attached api_InitializeDevelPackage_attribute_exploit_v2.txt file.  The attached 0001-frontend-Recheck-permissions-in-the-InitializeDevelP.patch fixes the exploit (aka "fixing my own dogfood"...). The other attached patch is unrelated to the concrete exploit, but potentially avoids a future headache.  I also CCed security@suse.de  Sorry for the inconveniance...

I guess it makes sense to wait until then. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1100217#c7)  Björn Geuken   2018-07-25 12:14:13 UTC  ``` Packages, and appliances, got now released.  In case anyone wonders why this took so long... The package builds for SLE12 failed about 5 times due to various flickering tests. Some additional time was spent on testing the build packages and waiting for the package release t finish.  Sorry for that. ``` |  |

```
This makes sure that we check the permissions of the correct package. For
instance, assume that the project "Staging" is a link project where the
link points to the "Base" project. Also, assume that there exists a
"Base/foo" package, but there exists no explicit "Staging/foo" package.
Moreover, assume we check the permissions for the following "submit"
action:

<action type="submit">
  <source project="Staging" package="foo"/>
  <target project="an_arbitrary_project" package="foo"/>
</action>

In this case, the old code checks if request acceptor can modify the
"Base/foo" package (since it follows the project link). This is wrong
because the "Staging/foo" package would be turned into a branch during
accept.
The new code checks the correct package because it does not follow the
project link and requires that the source package exists in the source
project. Requiring the existence of the source package potentially
breaks artificial requests (for instance, a request where the "submit"
action from above is preceded by a "submit" action that creates a
"Staging/foo" package).

Note: so far I was unable to exploit the old code - so this is just
to avoid a potential future headache.
