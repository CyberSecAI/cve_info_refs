Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to paste URLs into the job submission page of the `lava-server` application. This feature allowed users to provide a URL that the server would then fetch and interpret as a job definition file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated Input:** The server was fetching content from arbitrary URLs without properly validating that the content was a legitimate job definition.
- **File Read Vulnerability:** By providing a URL to a local file, an attacker could force the `lava-server-gunicorn` to read any file on the server that is both readable by the `lavaserver` user and consists of valid YAML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing credentials, configuration data, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Forgery:** An attacker could submit a crafted HTTP request, providing a URL to a local file on the server.
- **URL Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of a URL provided in the job submission page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the job submission page:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `lava-server` web interface and its job submission functionality.
- **Knowledge of the server's file system:** To exploit this vulnerability effectively, the attacker would need knowledge of the file system structure on the target server in order to target specific files.
- **Ability to submit a job definition:** The attacker needs to have the privileges to submit a job definition through the web interface.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**
- The provided content indicates that this issue was found using a tool called "bandit".
- The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the ability to paste URLs in the submit page, effectively disabling the vulnerable feature.
- The vulnerability was present in `lava-server` versions prior to `2016.12-3` for Debian stretch and `2014.09.1-1+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie".
- The fix was applied by removing code related to URL handling from JavaScript files (`job-submit.js`) , HTML templates (`job_submit.html`), and Python view files (`views.py`). The related URL endpoint was also removed from `urls.py`.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply states that a user can read arbitrary files.
