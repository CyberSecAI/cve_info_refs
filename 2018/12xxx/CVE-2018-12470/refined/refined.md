Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12470:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `_createInsertSQLfromXML` subroutine within the `RegistrationSharing` module of the Subscription Management Tool (SMT).
*   The subroutine constructs SQL INSERT statements based on XML data received from POST requests. Specifically, it takes the `table` attribute from the XML and uses it to build the SQL statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `tableName` attribute within the XML data is not sanitized before being used in the SQL query. While attribute *values* are quoted, the *tableName* attribute is not. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `table` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can manipulate the SQL queries executed against the SMT database.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can insert entries into the `JobQueue` table, which is used by client machines to pull and execute jobs from the SMT server. The attacker can insert a job of the "execute" type, and include arbitrary commands to be executed on the client machines.
*   **Compromise of Client Machines:** This allows for code execution on *all* client machines by creating multiple malicious entries in the `JobQueue` table, potentially leading to backdoors, shell access, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker sends a specially crafted XML payload via an HTTP POST request to the `/regsvc` endpoint of the SMT server.
*   **XML Payload:** The malicious XML payload contains a modified `table` attribute within the `<tableData>` tag, injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SMT server to send the malicious HTTP POST requests.
*   **Understanding of SMT API:** The attacker needs some understanding of the SMT `/regsvc` API to format the POST request and XML payload correctly.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided details do not specify a need for authentication.

**Technical Details**

* Vulnerable code located at `<https://github.com/SUSE/smt/blob/SMT12/www/perl-lib/SMT/RegistrationSharing.pm#L298>`
* XML Payload Example for SQL Injection:
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <registrationData>
        <tableData table='Clients (GUID) VALUES("random_value_because_why_not");--'>
            <entry columnName="HOSTNAME" value="smt-client"/>
        </tableData>
    </registrationData>
```
* XML Payload example for RCE
```xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <registrationData>
        <tableData table='JobQueue'>
            <entry columnName="GUID_ID" value="16"/>
            <entry columnName="NAME" value="Code Execution"/>
            <entry columnName="DESCRIPTION" value="Code Execution"/>
            <entry columnName="TYPE" value="4"/>
            <entry columnName="ARGUMENTS" value='&lt;arguments command="touch /tmp/x">&lt;options>&lt;command>touch /tmp/x&lt;/command>&lt;/options>&lt;/arguments>'/>
        </tableData>
    </registrationData>
```
