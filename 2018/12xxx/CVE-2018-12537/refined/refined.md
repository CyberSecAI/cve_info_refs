  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2018-12537",
    "description": "Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Fuse",
      "Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `putHeader` method in Vert.x, used to set HTTP response headers, doesn't filter carriage return and line feed characters from the header value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences",
      "HTTP Header Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP response headers, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning attacks. This allows manipulation of values of the set HTTP headers and to add arbitrary new headers. In particular, issuing a redirection and manipulation of cookies set by the server is possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access through crafted HTTP requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request with CRLF sequences in header values. The attacker would need the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server.",

    ],
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in Eclipse Vert.x versions 3.0.0 to 3.5.1. It arises from improper handling of carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters when setting header values. A remote attacker can exploit this by injecting CRLF sequences within the header values, effectively adding new headers or modifying existing ones. Red Hat Fuse 7.2 and Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes are affected. The fix is in Vert.x 3.5.2."
