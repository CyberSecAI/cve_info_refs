"MOZ\_CRASH(Should never get here!)" is the reason.

Expected results:
No crash. Also I will mark as sensitive since I am seeing the words "MEMORY\_CORRUPTION\_LARGE\_80000003\_memory\_corruption!KERNEL32" in my windbg, though I'm not sure if it is. Also, about:home is linkable from web content, so if this was exploitable its even more dangerous as it requires no user interaction.

Crashes the whole browser for me -- boom down in IndexedDB [bp-90668379-16a2-4fbf-8e83-32b7e0180419](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/90668379-16a2-4fbf-8e83-32b7e0180419)
Could not reproduce in 58, 59 or 60 with a fresh profile which is kind of odd. Maybe I didn't have enough stored in IndexedDB for it to need to check the per-site quota? Haven't yet tried a fresh profile in nightly.
Doesn't seem exploitable in the malware sense, just a DoS -- but a bad one because it kills the parent process and not just the tab.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csectype-dos](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-dos&resolution=---),

I can verify current Nightly hits the assertion here [1] in debug build. If I comment [1], then it will crash in [2], which looks like the place [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1422456#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - about:home crashes whole browser (possible memory corruption)") mentioned. (Somehow I couldn't see the crash report)

I checked the origin [1] from GetInfoFromPrincipal() if typing "about:home?1:q". I expected that origin should be "about:home", but, actually, I got "about:home?1:q".
It seems that about protocol doesn't strip the ref and query which isn't expected by QuotaManager. So that if typing "about:home?1" or "about:home#2", I will get "about+home+1", and "about+home+2" in my profile.
I reckon in this bug we should do things below:
1. Make origin parser not be so strict. At least, it shouldn't let FF crash [2] if the format of handling protocol isn't as expected. We may still want to capture issues on Nightly via crashing it. But, as for Release and Beta, just return false should be fine.
2. Strip '?xxx' or '#xxx' for about protocol in GetInfoFromPrincipal() or returning false earlier [3] if mSchemeType is eNone in OriginParser.

According to the nsIPrincipal's interface [1] and the MDN documents for origin [2] (also the reference documents inside it), I expected the origin which getting from the Principal object shouldn't contain '?'. However, "about:home" seems to be an internal implementation for Gecko, so I'm not really sure should I fix internally in dom/quota/ActorsParent.cpp or somewhere else when the principal object for "about:xxx" is created.
baku, do you have any suggestion about that?

origin\_about.patch
We must get tests for this.
As of now, easiest might be some browser test which loads about:robots?foo and its contentDocument.nodePrincipal.URI.spec should be then about:robots. Need to test also # url with both # and ?.
I'd like to review this with the test.
Can the crash be somehow triggered by web page?

At the time of the report, yes. But ever since about:home has become unlinkable from web, so as of now, no.

Tom, so the URL fix has landed, but are we sure that there can't be any origin directories like about+home+1 ?
Maybe such directories could have been created, in that case we need to extend origin parser to support it.Flags: needinfo?(shes050117)

I open [bug 1491637](/show_bug.cgi?id=1491637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Origin Parser crashes while parsing \"about\+home\+[0-9]+\+*\"") for discussing and investigating that if they were created, we might want to support them in that bug.Flags: needinfo?(shes050117)

Is this worth backporting to Beta? If so, go ahead and do the request, it grafts cleanly.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-26

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 63

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 63

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

##### References

* [Bug 1495011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011)

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

##### References

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
Björn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

Steps to reproduce:
1- Open the Firefox
2- Go this website : <https://mixed-favicon.badssl.com/>
Actual results:
Although a web page icon loads as http, it may appear secure.
proof of concept:
proof.mov
Expected results:
Please look at the <https://mixed-favicon.badssl.com's> source code. You can see favicon icon as https. But if you open favicon file, it' redirecting to http page. This means : favicon file loading as http. This means : web page is not secure. But Firefox show web page as secure

Yes, it's preferable to create another bug for Firefox for iOS. Bugzilla has a separate component for this. Thanks!

I expect this will have been fixed by Mossop's changes to favicon loading. We may want to mark this bug fixed and set the relevant affected/fixed versions.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend)

My changes didn't land until 63 though and this claimed to have been resolved in 61. Do we have a test in tree for this case? It's possible my change may have affected this.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend) → needinfo?(jhofmann)

Hello,
this problem can be reproduced in 61.0.2. If you want to demonstrate you can see "proof.mov" in attachments. But this problem can not be reproduced in the "nightly" version. I can not reproduced in the nightly version. Also, this problem is reproducible for firefox iOS(13.1). I created a new report for iOS . You can see [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1484916](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484916 "NEW - Firefox for iOS does not show an indicator for \"passive\" mixed-content") .

To clarify, this is fixed in Nightly (63) and broken in 61 and 62, so that sounds a lot like your patch fixed it.
I don't think we have a test for it yet, since that test would have been broken until your change. It would be a good idea to write one.

Unfortunately no-one involved in this conversation is an iOS engineer. I'm afraid you just need to wait till someone from the iOS side of things looks into your report.

The bounty committee makes these decisions, not Dave (or me), and you can't request consideration like this - you should follow the guidance on <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/client-bug-bounty/> .
That said, this is rated sec-low and is therefore not eligible for a bounty - only sec-critical, sec-high and sometimes sec-moderate severity bugs are eligible for a bounty.Flags: needinfo?(dtownsend)

# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

SameSite cookies, bypass mixed content warnings, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-12388](/security/CVE-2018-12388), [CVE-2018-12390](/security/CVE-2018-12390), [CVE-2018-12392](/security/CVE-2018-12392), [CVE-2018-12393](/security/CVE-2018-12393),

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
