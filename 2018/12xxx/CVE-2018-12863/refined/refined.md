Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-12863:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists within Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or exploitable conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user.

**Attack vectors:** This vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted file is processed by the vulnerable application (Adobe Acrobat or Reader). The specific file format or parsing routine that leads to the use-after-free condition is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but it was discovered via fuzzing the JP2K library (JPEG2000)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious file and trick a user into opening it using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader. This would likely involve social engineering to deliver the file to the target user.
