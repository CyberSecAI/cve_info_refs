- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insecure directory permissions in the Intel OpenVINO Toolkit for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect directory permissions allow an authenticated user to potentially execute code by leveraging default directory permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to local privilege escalation. An attacker can execute code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed and running. The attacker also needs to trigger a user interaction.
