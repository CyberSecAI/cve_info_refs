> Dear all,
> The following memory corruption issues in ntfs.ko (such as use-after-frees, stack- \
> and heap-out-of-bounds accesses and BUG_ON / BUG assertion fails) were found by a \
> modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have \
> attached the causing NTFS filesystem image, the dmesg reports, KASAN reports and \
> the source code of a simple mounting tool to reproduce those issues \
> (ntfs_inject.c).
> A local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to mount filesystems \
> (or a system components which auto mounts filesystems) could trigger a kernel oops, \
> a kernel panic (depending on panic_on_oops) or exploit those bugs to raise \
> privileges.
> We can verify this issues for Linux 4.15.0-15.16 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from \
> "pull-lp-source linux").

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1597831#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-03 16:56:01 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ntfs_read_locked_inode in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel. This allows attackers to trigger a use-after-free read and possibly cause a denial of service via a crafted ntfs filesystem.  References:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1763403](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1763403) 	  <https://marc.info/?l=linux-ntfs-dev&m=152413769810234&w=2>  <https://marc.info/?t=152407734400002&r=1&w=2> (a whole thread)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1597831#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-03 16:57:26 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1597832](show_bug.cgi?id=1597832 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2018-12929 kernel: use-after-free in ntfs_read_locked_inode in the ntfs.ko [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1597831#c6)  Vladis Dronov    2018-07-12 11:17:48 UTC  ``` Notes:  The NTFS filesystem is shipped only with Red Hat MRG-2 product.  While the flaw reproducer works when run as a privileged user (the "root"), this requires a mount of a certain filesystem image. An unprivileged attacker cannot do this even from a user+mount namespace:  $ unshare -U -r -m # mount -t ntfs fs.img mnt/ mount: mnt/: mount failed: Operation not permitted.  The article <https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/> (thanks, Jonathan!) discusses unprivileged user mounts and hostile filesystem images:   > ... for the most part, the mount() system call is denied to processes running > within user namespaces, even if they are privileged in their namespaces.  It also states that unprivileged filesystem mounts are not allowed as of now in the Linux kernel and probably won't be allowed in a future. Until that such flaws are considered as not exploitable:  > There were no proposals for solutions to the hostile-filesystem problem. > But, in the absence of some sort of assurance that they can be made safe, > unprivileged filesystem mounts are unlikely to gain acceptance; even if the > feature gets into the kernel, distributions would be likely to disable it.  On the other hand, there is a potential possibility that still an attacker can trick a regular user to mount a malicious filesystem image, like trick him to insert an usb-flash-drive with a forged filesystem to a desktop system which will auto-mount it. In case this results only in a system crash (a DoS due to, for example, a NULL pointer dereference) the flaw impact is low but it still exists. In case of a flaw which results in a privilege escalation the flaw's impact is higher.  So the Red Hat would still consider bugs which require mounting a filesystem image to exploit as security flaws, though with Low severity.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1597831#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-26 07:45:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2019:0641 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0641](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0641)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1597831#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:05:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1597837#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-03 17:01:12 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ntfs_end_buffer_async_read in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel. This allows attackers to trigger a stack-based out-of-bounds write and cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ntfs filesystem. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.

While the flaw reproducer works when run as a privileged user (the "root"), this requires a mount of a certain filesystem image. An unprivileged attacker cannot do this even from a user+mount namespace:  $ unshare -U -r -m # mount -t ntfs fs.img mnt/ mount: mnt/: mount failed: Operation not permitted.  The article <https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/> (thanks, Jonathan!) discusses unprivileged user mounts and hostile filesystem images:   > ... for the most part, the mount() system call is denied to processes running > within user namespaces, even if they are privileged in their namespaces.  It also states that unprivileged filesystem mounts are not allowed as of now in the Linux kernel and probably won't be allowed in a future. Until that such flaws are considered as not exploitable:  > There were no proposals for solutions to the hostile-filesystem problem. > But, in the absence of some sort of assurance that they can be made safe, > unprivileged filesystem mounts are unlikely to gain acceptance; even if the > feature gets into the kernel, distributions would be likely to disable it.  On the other hand, there is a potential possibility that still an attacker can trick a regular user to mount a malicious filesystem image, like trick him to insert an usb-flash-drive with a forged filesystem to a desktop system which will auto-mount it. In case this results only in a system crash (a DoS due to, for example, a NULL pointer dereference) the flaw impact is low but it still exists. In case of a flaw which results in a privilege escalation the flaw's impact is higher.  So the Red Hat would still consider bugs which require mounting a filesystem image to exploit as security flaws, though with Low severity.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1597837#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-03-26 07:45:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2019:0641 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0641](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0641)   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Dear all,

The following memory corruption issues in ntfs.ko (such as use-after-frees, stack- and heap-out-of-bounds accesses and BUG\_ON / BUG assertion fails) were found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the causing NTFS filesystem image, the dmesg reports, KASAN reports and the source code of a simple mounting tool to reproduce those issues (ntfs\_inject.c).

A local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to mount filesystems (or a system components which auto mounts filesystems) could trigger a kernel oops, a kernel panic (depending on panic\_on\_oops) or exploit those bugs to raise privileges.

We can verify this issues for Linux 4.15.0-15.16 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source linux").
