## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

bypass same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-28

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird ESR 60.3

Announced
October 31, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.3

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
low
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_13\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.75 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://test.shhnjk.com/hls/webvideo.html>
2. Wait for video to stop playing and observe the alert saying "super bad"
Actual results:
Cross-origin audio data leaks. Audio tag on the right side will play stolen sound.
Expected results:
HTTP Live Stream is supported in Firefox for Android. And the M3U8 file allows audio data to be fetched from other origin. But Firefox only checks the url and misses the following redirect in <https://test.shhnjk.com/hls/same.m3u8>
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio",NAME="English stereo",LANGUAGE="en",AUTOSELECT=YES,URI="<https://test.shhnjk.com/location.php?url=https://vuln.shhnjk.com/audio.m3u8>"
Where audio file is redirected and provided from "<https://vuln.shhnjk.com/audio.m3u8>". We can abuse this missed check to steal the audio samples using Web Audio API and read the audio data across-origin.

:drno, :padenot, seems :jya is on PTO so pinging you about this - feel free to redirect to someone else who knows our Fennec AV stack better.
Jun: thanks for the report. I'm assuming, based on you filing this against Firefox for Android, that this doesn't affect desktop (presumably because we're using platform support for m3u8 on Android, but don't do that elsewhere )?Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)Flags: needinfo?(padenot)Flags: needinfo?(drno)

I don't think Firefox supports HLS (.m3u8 files) in Desktop. If that's supported in any other platform, then it might be affected.Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)

Nick, you've reviewed some of this before. It looks like the right people are gone.
I can't repro on Nightly, but I can repro on release. On Nightly, the page does not seem to work, and Nightly eventually crashes [0].
Firefox Desktop does not support m3u8 playback so we're good there.
We think that we're handling cross-origin issues at [1]. Looks like we're doing some principal checking there but it's not about the resource, it's the URL of the manifest, so the CORS check passes.
[2] is probably where the problem lies: you can configure to bail out when a cross-protocol redirect occurs, but nothing about principals.
The root of the problem is that we're letting something that is not Gecko perform an HTTP connection to a URL that can be controlled by content, and that's VERY BAD. This bit of Java does not know anything about CORS, and is upstream code (that we appear to have patched). One solution is to plumb down a principal CORS to DefaultHttpDataSource.java and teach it about CORS, but maybe there is something better we can do.
I'm pretty sure I can trivially turn this into an arbitrary cross-origin resource access (text/image/whatever) with a variant of [3].
cc-ing network people because this is a bit bigger in scope that I would have anticipated.

Yowza. I have no idea about any of the details of exoplayer2 -- I really was involved only to get the build system plumbing arranged. I'm not really surprised that Fennec's integration of that component caused issues in this manner:a mismatch of expectations between the browser and the consumed library. Score another one for really owning our network stack, even in our component libraries. My understanding is that this is \_not\_ an issue with exoplayer2, i.e., that this is an issue only because of the same-origin policy that the browser needs to enforce, which arbitrary exoplayer2 consumers don't care about.
I think the best thing I can do is expand the discussion to include snorp, who can a) vet my understanding of whether this needs to be upstreamed to exoplayer2, b) comment on whether this is relevant to GeckoView and/or future Android browsers, and c) redirect further to actually fix the underlying issue, or make the decision to disable exoplayer2/HLS in Firefox for Android.Flags: needinfo?(nalexander) → needinfo?(snorp)

If we can't change exoplayer2 do we know enough in the Gecko layers to simply taint all HLS video, even same-origin ones? If most sites that use it are just playing the content (and it's not supported on Desktop anyway) maybe that's good enough?
Do we use exoplayer2 for other things? If so then the lack of CORS support is going to bite lots of other places.Keywords: [csectype-sop](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-sop&resolution=---),

exoplayer2 follows redirects I have seen that. Gecko does not know about these redirects. If gecko would know that a cross-origin redirect is made it could make proper decisions and avoid this problem. My question was is there a way the exoplayer2 tells gecko that it follow a redirect?

Yes, attaching a patch that does that if that's what we want. The patch is very simple.

It's only used to playback streams in HTMLMediaElement on Android (no other parts of Gecko make use of it). However it's plausible that some content is trying to do something more complex with those HTMLMediaElement (captureStream, Web Audio, canvas, etc.).
We could teach exoplayer2 about CORS, it does not seem too complicated from a quick look. We could also find a way to find the URL from which the media is currently being fetched from (after all redirects, etc.) and use Gecko facilities to determine the CORS status. I haven't seen an API call to do so (but haven't looked very hard), but it does not seem too crazy to add.
We could also wrap Gecko channnnels in a Java interface and inject it into exoplayer2. It's a bit weird to have something making http(s) requests randomly in Java code, in the middle of the media decoder of a browser engine.

Not in the current state of the code it looks like unfortunately.

Dragana's suggestion here sounds like the best path forward to me, if technically feasible: Hooking up exoplayer2 redirects with Gecko internal redirects (e.g. by then calling nsContentSecuriyManager::AsyncOnChannelRedirect()) would automagically perform the right security checks.
Is it possible to get callbacks into Gecko whenever exoplayer2 follows a redirect?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Not using current APIs offered by exoplayer2 for now. It's doable though.

I think this path is the best technically and produces the best outcome, but the cost is high and Fennec is in deep maintenance mode. I would follow this approach only if the exoplayer2 stack will be used for GeckoView. I do see that the thirdparty source is in geckoview/src/thirdparty/exoplayer2, so that seems positive. Even if we do try to "do the right thing", I think we should reconsider the correct path for HLS support in GeckoView. Is the best place to work...
- our own stack (expensive to build on Android, but the best outcome?)
- upstream exoplayer2 (a chance to update to newer exoplayer2 and solve this problem at the right level)
- our vendored exoplayer2 (little chance of breaking other things)
I'd like snorp to weigh in before we spend too much time trying to pursue the "correct" fix for exoplayer2.

IIRC, this wasn't feasible due to patent issues, but I also remember ajones telling me this gets better at some point. 2019?

I don't have a strong opinion on either of those options. Depending on the patent situation, we may not need to use exoplayer much longer. It's also not clear if HLS will remain relevant.Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

AFAIK, almost any streams on android is an HLS one... so it's still very relevant on mobile...

The change treats all HLS stream as cross-origin, even for same-origin resources.

I understand the need to be discrete here on the vulnerability, but I'm concerned that the method as it is now will have its reasoning disappear into oblivion in a short amount of time.

For posterity's sake, I talked to padenot and asked him if this bug could move forward.
I didn't clearly explain that he needs separate(!) sec-approval on the patch, that I'm not entitled to grant.
I should have made clear during the conversation.
On a more uplifting note, padenot also tells me that there are other, unrelated bugs that actually stop the exploit from working.

Per discussion on IRC, we're going to take this on ESR after all to benefit the Tor folks (who ship an Android browser from that branch).

[crash.html (minimised testcase)](attachment.cgi?id=9010609)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9010609&action=edit)

The following testcase crashes the lates ASAN build of Firefox 64.0a1 (BuildID=20180919100043). It looks like we have to win a race to trigger the issue, so it might require a few reloads/restarts.
<script>
function spin() {
var x=new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST","<https://mozilla.org>",false);
try{x.send("X");}catch(e){}
}
function start() {
reloadurl = location.href;
o707=window.document;
o715=new WebSocket("ws://0.0.0.0");
o731=o707.createElement('template');
o707.onfocus=fun1;
o715.onerror=fun0;
spin();
}
function fun0() {
o707.writeln("x");
}
function fun1() {
x=o731.content;
o707.execCommand('subscript',false,null);
o707.open();
window.top.setTimeout("window.top.location.href='"+reloadurl+"'",400);;
}
</script>
<body onload="start()"></body>

Jason, can you see if there could be something that needs fixing in XHR/Web Sockets here?Component: DOM: Core & HTML → DOM: NetworkingFlags: needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs)Priority: -- → P1

I think this is unlikely to be related to XHR. The reason XHR is on the stack is that that's one of the ways that web content can trigger a nested event loop (which is presumably part of the issue here). We need somebody familiar with XPConnect / dom bindings to investigate.Flags: needinfo?(jduell.mcbugs) → needinfo?(overholt)

Nothing to do with XPConnect or dom bindings either ;)
This is about document.open and replacing inner window and such.

[crash.html (modified to crash easier)](attachment.cgi?id=9012373)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9012373&action=edit)

This seems to crash pretty reliably even on debug build (non-asan), at least when loaded from a local file.

Maybe name this aUnsuppressEventHandling (reversing the values of course)?

I actually wanted to use aForDocumentOpen since I expect that other might need it too.
And it is, IMO, easier to understand why such special case is happening.

dont\_unsupress\_during\_document\_open.diff
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch does pin point to the issue, and actually, constructing at least a crash should be somewhat easy.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Commit message could be something like
-m "[Bug 1492823](/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823 "VERIFIED FIXED - js::AssertSameCompartment failure in nsHTMLDocument::Open"), ensure user input suppression works correctly even after document.open, r=peterv"
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
see above. (I think this has been an issue at least since [bug 946641](/show_bug.cgi?id=946641 "RESOLVED FIXED - Drop delayed events associated with a document when it's closed"), FF28)
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Looks like esr60 might need a separate patch, since [bug 1451913](/show_bug.cgi?id=1451913 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in nsPIDOMWindowInner::UpdateWebSocketCount") is the one which added handleDocumentOpen variable.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I'd say rather unlikely to cause regressions. One needs to have document.open running inside sync xhr or so.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 63

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 63

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

##### References

* [Bug 1495011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011)

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

##### References

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

##### References

* [Bug 1487478](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478)

#### [#CVE-2018-12398: CSP bypass through stylesheet injection in resource URIs](#CVE-2018-12398)

Reporter
cgvwzq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using the reflected URL in some special resource URIs, such as `chrome:`, it is possible to inject stylesheets and bypass Content Security Policy (CSP).

##### References

* [Bug 1460538](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1460538)
* [Bug 1488061](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488061)

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
Björn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

* [Bug 1469916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916)

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

##### References

* [Bug 1490276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1490276)

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1448305](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1448305)

#### [#CVE-2018-12401: DOS attack through special resource URI parsing](#CVE-2018-12401)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1422456](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422456)

#### [#CVE-2018-12403: Mixed content warning is not displayed when HTTPS page loads a favicon over HTTP](#CVE-2018-12403)

Reporter
Yiğit Can Yilmaz
Impact
low
##### Description

If a site is loaded over a HTTPS connection but loads a favicon resource over HTTP, the mixed content warning is not displayed to users.

##### References

* [Bug 1484753](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1484753)

#### [#CVE-2018-12388: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 63](#CVE-2018-12388)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Dana Keeler, Ronald Crane, Marcia Knous, Tyson Smith, Daniel Veditz, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

SameSite cookies, bypass mixed content warnings, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-12388](/security/CVE-2018-12388), [CVE-2018-12390](/security/CVE-2018-12390), [CVE-2018-12392](/security/CVE-2018-12392), [CVE-2018-12393](/security/CVE-2018-12393),

[CVE-2018-12398](/security/CVE-2018-12398), [CVE-2018-12399](/security/CVE-2018-12399), [CVE-2018-12401](/security/CVE-2018-12401), [CVE-2018-12402](/security/CVE-2018-12402),

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-27

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.3

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

##### References

* [Bug 1495011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011)

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

##### References

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

##### References

* [Bug 1487478](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478)

#### [#CVE-2018-12389: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3](#CVE-2018-12389)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
low
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
