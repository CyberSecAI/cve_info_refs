Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12866:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided documents directly reference CVE-2018-12866 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB18-30.
*   The Checkpoint research document also lists it as one of the CVEs discovered during their fuzzing efforts.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds read**.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This means the software is attempting to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact of successful exploitation of this vulnerability is **information disclosure**. By reading data from arbitrary memory locations an attacker could potentially leak sensitive information, such as memory addresses, or other data in memory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the processing of a crafted file (likely a PDF or a file containing JPEG2000 data due to the focus on `JP2KLib.dll`). The Checkpoint document focuses on the JPEG2000 parsing within Adobe Reader.
*   The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted file to the vulnerable software that triggers the out-of-bounds read.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file to the victim, which then needs to be opened with the vulnerable Adobe Reader or Acrobat software.
*   The attacker would need some knowledge to craft a file in a way that would trigger this out-of-bounds read in the affected software.

**Summary of relevant details**

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Out-of-bounds read
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted file (likely a PDF or file with JPEG2000 content)
*  **Affected Software:** Adobe Acrobat and Reader (multiple versions).
*   **Root Cause:** Attempt to read data outside the bounds of allocated memory.

The Checkpoint document provides additional context, detailing their methodology for discovering the vulnerability via fuzzing, focusing on the JPEG2000 parser (`JP2KLib.dll`). They created a harness to more easily fuzz the library and triggered the vulnerability with crafted input. This information helps to understand how the vulnerability was found and potentially what part of the code is affected.
