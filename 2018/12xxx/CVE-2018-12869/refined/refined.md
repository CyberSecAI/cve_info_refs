Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-12869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds read** issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to **information disclosure**.
*   This means an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as **Important**, indicating that it could have a considerable impact if exploited.
*   An out-of-bounds read is often a prerequisite for other, more severe exploits, as it can be leveraged to bypass security measures, obtain sensitive data or gain insight into the program's memory layout.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, specifically within the processing of the JP2K (JPEG2000) image format.
*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious JP2K image that, when processed by vulnerable versions of Adobe Acrobat or Reader, triggers the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   The attacker would likely need to entice a user to open a malicious PDF file, potentially through phishing or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a crafted malicious JP2K file.
*   They would need to deliver the malicious PDF file to a user running a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
*   No specific access or elevated privileges are required beyond the ability to deliver a file to the user and have them open it within the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes**

*   The Checkpoint Research article provides additional context and insights into the methodology used to discover this vulnerability. It details how they used fuzzing techniques with WinAFL to find bugs in the JP2KLib.dll.
*   The Adobe Security Bulletin APSB18-30 lists CVE-2018-12869 alongside many other vulnerabilities discovered, including out-of-bounds writes, heap overflows, use-after-frees, and type confusions, showing the wide range of issues found by the researchers.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Netanel Ben-Simon and Yoav Alon from Check Point Software Technologies as part of a larger research effort to find vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader.
