- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `keywords` parameter of the `/admin/modules/master_file/rda_cmc.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Stealing cookies of logged-in administrators.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Downloading malware onto user machines.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `keywords` parameter.
    - The attacker injects the payload (e.g., `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` or `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`) into the search box in the Master File module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application and inject the malicious payload into the `keywords` parameter.
    - The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link that contains the payload.
