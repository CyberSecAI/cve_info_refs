Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way Asterisk handles incoming HTTP requests over TCP/TLS connections, specifically within the `iostreams` module. When Asterisk receives an HTTP request, it attempts to read and discard the request body content before sending a response (especially error responses). If the client closes the connection prematurely or sends a `Content-Length` header that doesn't match the actual data sent, the reading process gets stuck in an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite loop:** The core issue is the uncontrolled looping behavior during the reading of request body when the connection is closed unexpectedly or the `Content-Length` is invalid.
- **Lack of proper error handling:** The iostreams module did not have adequate error checking to handle situations when the client disconnects or sends invalid data. This lack of error handling is the direct cause of the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the infinite loop, causing a specific thread on the Asterisk server to consume 100% CPU, effectively rendering the system unresponsive and unusable. This constitutes a critical denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Premature Client Disconnect:** An attacker can simply initiate a TCP/TLS connection to the Asterisk server, send a partial or invalid request, and then abruptly close the connection.
- **Crafted HTTP Message:** An attacker can send an HTTP request with a misleading `Content-Length` header that doesn't correspond to the actual body data, which triggers the vulnerable loop.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP/TLS connection to the Asterisk server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand basic HTTP requests and the `Content-Length` header. They can use tools like `openssl s_client` to craft the malicious request.
- **No authentication required:** The advisory mentions the vulnerability is exploitable through remote authenticated sessions. However, it is possible to trigger the vulnerability even without authentication since the issue is in how Asterisk parses the incoming request.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to Asterisk versions 15.x before the fix in version 15.4.1.
- The issue was found to be present in the `iostreams` module when TLS is used.
- Patches were released to fix the issue which implemented more robust error handling.
