Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user. Specifically, it is possible to add an admin user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can add a new administrator account to the BEESCMS application without the legitimate administrator's knowledge or consent. This grants the attacker full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is performed through a malicious webpage containing a form that submits a crafted request to the vulnerable application. When a logged-in administrator visits the malicious page, the browser automatically includes the session cookies, leading the server to process the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that includes the crafted form.
   - The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious webpage.
   - The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the creation of a new administrator user with username "test1" and password "test1".
- The vulnerability exists in the admin_admin.php file in the BEESCMS application.
