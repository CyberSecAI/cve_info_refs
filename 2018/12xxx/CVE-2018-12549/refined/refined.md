  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2018-12549": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "Root cause": "The OpenJ9 JIT compiler incorrectly omitted a null check on the receiver object of an Unsafe call when accelerating it.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Missing null check on the receiver object of an Unsafe call"
        ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system by exploiting this vulnerability.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "By calling an unsafe function without a null check, allowing for arbitrary memory operations."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to execute code within a Java application that uses the vulnerable IBM JDK and can trigger the vulnerable code path (Unsafe call). They must have a way to provide inputs to trigger this code path, as well."
