Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect handling of the `mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized` flag in the `LoadInfo` object when service workers perform redirects. This flag is intended to indicate that the tainting of a response has been synthesized by a service worker, allowing it to override the default tainting behavior. However, the flag was not being cleared properly after a service worker interception resulting in the tainting being pinned to the service workers original tainting for any subsequent redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a same-origin policy bypass. Because the `mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized` flag was not being cleared properly after a service worker interception, a malicious site could use a service worker to redirect requests to a cross-origin resource. This resulted in that resource being treated as if it was from the same origin as the malicious site and thus bypassing CORS.
*   **Incorrect Tainting:** The core issue is that the tainting of network responses is not being updated correctly after redirects that follow a service worker interception. The synthesized tainting is incorrectly persisted to subsequent redirects, overriding expected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Reading Cross-Origin Resources:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read cross-origin credentialed resources without proper CORS checks. This could enable access to sensitive data from other websites by the malicious website with the vulnerable service worker.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By bypassing the same-origin policy, sensitive information can be exposed to malicious websites. This is because the malicious website can make a request to a cross-origin resource and due to the vulnerability the browser would treat the response as if it was same-origin allowing the malicious site to read its content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Service Worker:** The attacker needs to register a service worker on their controlled domain to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker manipulates the service worker to generate a redirect to a resource on a different origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to register a service worker:** The attacker must be able to register a service worker on their domain.
*   **Control over the service worker logic:** The attacker needs to control the behavior of the registered service worker to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fix involved not automatically copying the `mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized` flag, but instead manually copying the flag value only for those special service worker redirects.
*   The provided bug report includes WPT (Web Platform Tests) test cases that demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is considered **high** severity.
*   The issue was introduced in bug 1222008.
*   This vulnerability affects Firefox versions before the fix in version 61.
