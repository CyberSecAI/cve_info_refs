| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# USN-3705-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

5 July 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, read uninitialized

memory, bypass same-origin restrictions, bypass CORS restrictions,

bypass CSRF protections, obtain sensitive information, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5156](/security/CVE-2018-5156), [CVE-2018-5186](/security/CVE-2018-5186), [CVE-2018-5187](/security/CVE-2018-5187),

[CVE-2018-5188](/security/CVE-2018-5188), [CVE-2018-12358](/security/CVE-2018-12358), [CVE-2018-12359](/security/CVE-2018-12359), [CVE-2018-12360](/security/CVE-2018-12360),

[CVE-2018-12361](/security/CVE-2018-12361), [CVE-2018-12362](/security/CVE-2018-12362), [CVE-2018-12363](/security/CVE-2018-12363), [CVE-2018-12364](/security/CVE-2018-12364),

[CVE-2018-12365](/security/CVE-2018-12365), [CVE-2018-12366](/security/CVE-2018-12366), [CVE-2018-12367](/security/CVE-2018-12367), [CVE-2018-12370](/security/CVE-2018-12370),

[CVE-2018-12371](/security/CVE-2018-12371))

A security issue was discovered with WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to obtain full browser permissions.

([CVE-2018-12369](/security/CVE-2018-12369))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20100101
Steps to reproduce:
gfx::SwizzleCopy (gfx/2d/Swizzle.cpp) is unsafe:
static void
SwizzleCopy(const uint8\_t\* aSrc, int32\_t aSrcGap,
uint8\_t\* aDst, int32\_t aDstGap,
IntSize aSize, int32\_t aBPP)
{
if (aSrc != aDst) {
int32\_t rowLength = aBPP \* aSize.width; // (1)
for (int32\_t height = aSize.height; height > 0; height--) {
memcpy(aDst, aSrc, rowLength); // (0)
aSrc += rowLength + aSrcGap; // (2)
aDst += rowLength + aDstGap; // (3)
}
}
}
At (1), rowLength can overflow and become a very large negative value. For example, if aSize.width = 0x20000000, it will overflow to -2147483648 at 4 BPP. Then, the overflowed value is used at (2) and (3) to calculate pointers, that may either underflow the currently owned memory, or even wrap around aSrc/aDst on x86 arch. Then, the call to memcpy() at (0) with wrongly calculated pointers and count can cause an out of bound access.
In addition, both aSrcGap and aDstGap are calculated in the same unsafe manner in the caller:
bool
SwizzleData(const uint8\_t\* aSrc, int32\_t aSrcStride, SurfaceFormat aSrcFormat,
uint8\_t\* aDst, int32\_t aDstStride, SurfaceFormat aDstFormat,
const IntSize& aSize)
{
if (aSize.IsEmpty()) {
return true;
}
IntSize size = CollapseSize(aSize, aSrcStride, aDstStride); // (4)
// Find gap from end of row to the start of the next row.
int32\_t srcGap = aSrcStride - BytesPerPixel(aSrcFormat) \* aSize.width; // (5)
int32\_t dstGap = aDstStride - BytesPerPixel(aDstFormat) \* aSize.width; // (6)
MOZ\_ASSERT(srcGap >= 0 && dstGap >= 0); // (7)
[...]
if (aSrcFormat == aDstFormat) {
// If the formats match, just do a generic copy.
SwizzleCopy(aSrc, srcGap, aDst, dstGap, size, BytesPerPixel(aSrcFormat));
return true;
}
[...]
}
At (5) and (6), srcGap and dstGap can overflow in exactly the same way as described above. The possibly overflowed values are then passed to SwizzleCopy and used to calculate pointer values.
Here an example of the crash on Firefox 59.0.2 which happens when aDst underflows and wraps around:
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/19b58581-7c59-4227-95c3-9d0b30180422>
And the crashes which happen when aDst or aSrc point to unowned memory:
aSrc: <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/aa3f07a1-6ed3-4aad-ae17-ed1170180424>
aDst: <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/905535d1-49f9-4657-8e3a-8b73d0180427>
The input graphics region which causes incorrect calculations is sanitized in a few places before the call to SwizzleCopy, but it is not sanitized properly. For example, at (4) the call to CollapseSize (/gfx/2d/Swizzle.cpp) does check that aSize.width \* aSize.height is within safe bounds of int32, but the check only happens if specific conditions are met. Also, it does not account for the BPP multiplier which is used at (1), (5), (6):
static inline IntSize
CollapseSize(const IntSize& aSize, int32\_t aSrcStride, int32\_t aDstStride)
{
if (aSrcStride == aDstStride &&
aSrcStride == 4 \* aSize.width) {
CheckedInt32 area = CheckedInt32(aSize.width) \* CheckedInt32(aSize.height);
if (area.isValid()) {
return IntSize(area.value(), 1);
}
}
return aSize;
}
One more check at (7) is a correct assert, however it's compiled out in release builds. A few more checks happen inside the CopyRect (gfx/2d/DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp) caller of SwizzleData, that again they do not account for the BytesPerPixel multiplier.
It would be optimal to insert early checks, for every acquired graphics region, that both values of width \* bpp and height \* bpp do not overflow int32, ideally with a margin. Because the value of BytesPerPixel is relatively small, such a check would automatically rule out majority of other possible overflows.

No, I decided not to invest the time into creating PoCs, since the crash stats provide a very strong proof of bug, and also indicate what exactly went wrong with this code.
Btw, here is a fresh one from 60.0.1: <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/21f0097d-a74f-4510-a530-7949c0180522>
> What difference are you seeing in those last two that lets you know one was
> aSrc and the other aDst?
The difference is in the type of access violation. In the first crash, the type of exception is EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION\_READ and the crashing site is "memcpy(aDst, aSrc, rowLength)" within a loop. Therefore, it crashed while trying to read aSrc.
Next, consider the crash address: 0x2d198000 - it's page aligned. Typically when you have an out of bounds read, it will read successfully (iterating over unowned but valid memory) until it hits the end of the heap chunk. Then it will crash while trying to read unallocated memory, at a page-aligned address. Heap chunks are always page-aligned. Thus, an address like this is a strong indication of an iterative OOB read.
For the second crash, the type of crash is EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION\_WRITE and the crashing site is the same "memcpy(aDst, aSrc, rowLength)". Therefore it crashed while trying to write to aDst. That could happen due to a number of reasons, for ex. aDst miscalculated, or rowLength was too long for the allocated buffer which is pointed to by aDst. However the third crash which I have referenced (<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/19b58581-7c59-4227-95c3-9d0b30180422>) provides a strong indication of the former (aDst pointer miscalculation), since it's crashed with a bogus address 0xffffffffbda8fffc. This address is in kernel mode, and should never be referenced by a userland program. It can most likely be referenced due to a pointer arithmetic wrap-around.
Thus I have concluded that the primary probable reason of crashes is due to pointer miscalculation.
The root cause of such miscalculation may originate from one of the multiple issues with the code which calls "SwizzleCopy", as well as in SwizzleCopy itself. These issues I have reported in the original bug report.Flags: needinfo?(r)

This hardens some code in DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp to calculate buffer sizes in a safe way and also hardens the swizzle stride gap code such that overflows will be handled up front (and return early with an error) so that later swizzle code doesn't need to worry about safety.Assignee: nobody â†’ lsalzmanStatus: NEW â†’ ASSIGNED

cleanup of swizzle stride calculations
[Security approval request comment]
> How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
> Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The patch description doesn't point at the problem, per se, but with knowledge of where the swizzle and data surface helpers are used, one might be able to guess how to create surfaces that would cause the overflow here.
> Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
This affects 54+ as I introduced the swizzle API in [bug 738343](/show_bug.cgi?id=738343 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use a central library for pixel format conversion and alpha-(un)premultiplication"). ESR 52 should be safe/unaffected.
> How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
This just causes the swizzle routines to bail when an overflow is detected at runtime. It shouldn't be very risky.

* [Bug 1462891](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462891)

#### [#CVE-2018-12368: No warning when opening executable SettingContent-ms files](#CVE-2018-12368)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467852#c0)â€¢ 7 years ago |
|  | |

In [bug 1222008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222008 "RESOLVED FIXED - propagate final URL from .respondWith() Response back to intercepted channel as a fake redirect") we added a flag that specifies that the tainting on a particular LoadInfo has been synthesized by a service worker. This allows the service worker to override the tainting that would have been otherwise set for the response.
For example, if a page does `fetch(crossOriginURL)`, we start tainting the response immediately when we see the cross-origin URL. The intercepting service worker, though, can do `e.respondWith(fetch(sameOriginURL))` which overrides the tainting back to a same-origin "basic" response. The flag added in [bug 1222008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222008 "RESOLVED FIXED - propagate final URL from .respondWith() Response back to intercepted channel as a fake redirect") makes sure our security code doesn't then come along and force the tainting back to something else.
The problem, though, is we are currently copying the flag when a redirected channel's LoadInfo is created:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c621276fbdd9591f52009042d959b9e19b66d49f/netwerk/base/LoadInfo.cpp#399>
I believe this means probably means its possible to bypass same-origin policy and read no-cors opaque responses by doing something like:
1. evil.com registers a service worker
2. evil.com makes some request that will be intercepted by the SW
3. The SW responds with a redirect status code and Location header pointing at a private resource on good.com. This sets the synthesized flag.
4. The redirect is initiated and re-enters the SW, but the SW does not call respondWith(). (This incorrectly preserves the synthesized flag from 4.)
5. The normal network response retrieves good.com's resource, but is returned as a basic response because the synthesized flag from 4 is still set.
I'll see if I can write a test that demonstrates this.

Align LoadInfo::mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized handling with other service worker fields. r=valentin
This patch fixes a severe security issue in service worker interception code.
As described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467852#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - same-origin bypass using service worker and redirects due to incorrect redirected synthesized taint handling"), we have some code in the LoadInfo which tracks the tainting level of a response. For example, normally when a no-cors request crosses an origin it becomes opaque tainted forever more. Service workers, however, have the ability to response with a response with a different tainting which should override. For example, the service worker could intercept that cross-origin no-cors request and instead synthesize a basic same-origin response.
This is all well and good, but we have an added flag which pins the tainting at that service worker specified value. We need this because we trigger an extra redirect in order to communicate the Response.url that the service worker synthesized. Without that flag to pin the tainting value our security code ends up changing it again on this redirect.
The bug is when the service worker synthesizes a basic same-origin response that has a 30x status code. In these cases we follow the redirect after the service worker interception. Now that new redirect channel should be allowed to be tainted again. Unfortunately we never clear the flag that pins the tainting value after service worker interception. So any real redirect after a service worker interception are pinned at the service workers original tainting. This means an evil site can arrange to read cross-origin no-cors credentials requests (very bad).
This patch fixes by doing a few things:
1. Don't automatically copy the mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized flag in the LoadInfo copy constructor. Instead initialize to false.
2. Make the e10s and non-e10s channel implementation manually copy the flag value across to the new channel only for those special service worker redirects.
3. Expose SynthesizeServiceWorkerTainting() on nsILoadInfo in order to better support step (2).
This fixes the WPT tests posted in this bug.

This bug allows a sites with a service worker to read cross-origin credentialed no-cors resources. This seems bad enough that it might be worth a chemspill.

Align LoadInfo::mServiceWorkerTaintingSynthesized handling with other service worker fields. r=valentin
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch is clearly about the tainting of responses returned from service workers and how we handle that in regards to redirects. I don't think it makes the issue of incorrectly freezing the tainting obvious, but someone could probably figure that out if the inspected the code.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I have a WPT test written, but I will land it separately later. The comments do not discuss the issue of keeping the tainting freezing too long.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Beta and release channel. ESR has the code, but service workers are disabled.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
This was introduced in [bug 1222008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222008 "RESOLVED FIXED - propagate final URL from .respondWith() Response back to intercepted channel as a fake redirect").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I believe this should backport cleanly, but I have not tried that yet.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
We have pretty good test coverage for this feature, although it did miss the issue in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467852#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - same-origin bypass using service worker and redirects due to incorrect redirected synthesized taint handling"). I believe the risk of regressions is low, but it is a complex interaction between service workers, networking, and redirects. Its possible that a regression could occur.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [Bug 1222008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222008 "RESOLVED FIXED - propagate final URL from .respondWith() Response back to intercepted channel as a fake redirect")
[User impact if declined]: A site with a service worker can read cross-origin credentialed resources without CORS. So evil.com can read a credentialed bank.com page, etc.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: I have a WPT test written that triggers this, but I will land it separately.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: No, due to security issue it has not landed yet.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: Moderate
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The code change is relatively small, but the interaction between networking, service workers, and redirects is complex. There is some risk there is another corner case that we missed and also don't have a test for.
[String changes made/needed]: None

Release management can overrule me but I see no discussion of chemspilling over this.
If this is a public 0day or we think this is so serious that we \*must\* release it early, we can reconsider landing it on release.
