Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12179:

**Verification:**

The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com_6eac413d_20250126_050008.html`  directly mentions CVE-2018-12179 within the bug report summary and blocks field, confirming its relevance to the CVE. The content from `lists.fedoraproject.org_1516d755_20250125_011528.html` also lists CVE-2018-12179 as part of the security update for `edk2`.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is described in relation to the issue where a VM turns on but displays a black screen with high CPU usage (`bugzilla.redhat.com_580a500a_20250126_050007.html`). This is due to two main problems when using arbitrary memory sizes with UEFI firmware (edk2/OVMF) and QEMU:
   *   **PCIEXBAR Placement Disagreement:** There is a disagreement between QEMU and OVMF in the placement of PCIEXBAR.
   *   **MTRR Configuration:** Incorrect Memory Type Range Register (MTRR) configuration, specifically when using small RAM sizes with many bits clear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The primary vulnerability lies in the way memory is allocated and configured when using specific memory sizes, specifically 2560MB and other non-standard sizes, in a QEMU/KVM virtual machine with UEFI firmware.  This triggers problems in the initialization process.
- The content suggests there are two flaws: improper configuration in system firmware that leads to privilege escalation ([bug 1694072](show_bug.cgi?id=1694072), described as "CLOSED NOTABUG")

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the VM fails to boot and gets stuck at a black screen with high CPU usage but minimal memory usage. The system is unusable.
- The related bug report ([bug 1694072](show_bug.cgi?id=1694072)) suggests that improper configuration can lead to privilege escalation; this is marked as NOTABUG.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the configuration of the virtual machine. An attacker who has the ability to configure the memory settings of a VM could trigger the vulnerability by using specific memory sizes, causing a denial of service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have control over the VM's memory configuration to set a problematic memory size. This could involve an administrator configuring the VM or an attacker who has compromised the virtualization management layer.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue is considered "unfixable" at the edk2 level, due to the inherent conflicts between how QEMU and OVMF handle memory allocation for certain configurations.
- The recommended workaround is to use known "safe" memory sizes (e.g., 512 MB, 768 MB, 1024 MB, 1536 MB, 2048 MB, 3072 MB, 4096 MB) to avoid the problem.
- The fix included in `edk2-20190501stable-2.fc30` involves rebasing edk2 to the `stable201905` release. This release includes fixes for the PCIEXBAR and MTRR configuration issues. It also includes a license change to BSD-2-Clause-Patent.
- Although the memory size issue was classified as "unfixable," the fix in the new `edk2` release addresses the issue by mitigating PCIEXBAR placement and fixing the MTRR configuration, effectively resolving the boot failure issue for the specific memory sizes.
- The update also includes fixes for other CVEs including CVE-2018-12182, CVE-2018-12183, and CVE-2019-0161 ([bug 1694085](show_bug.cgi?id=1694085))

In summary, CVE-2018-12179 highlights a configuration vulnerability in virtualized environments with UEFI firmware related to memory allocation, which can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by choosing specific memory sizes during the configuration of a VM. While the original reports indicated an "unfixable" issue, the fix was addressed through a new `edk2` release.
