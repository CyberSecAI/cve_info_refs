- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A timing side-channel leak occurs due to the use of fast modular arithmetic, which introduces branches that leak information regarding secret values during the generation of DSA and ECDSA signatures.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Timing side-channel leak
- **Impact of exploitation**: The timing side-channel leak can expose sensitive information regarding secret values used in DSA and ECDSA signatures.
- **Attack vectors**: By analyzing timing variations, an attacker can potentially deduce secret values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to measure the timing of the signature generation process.
