{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The device exposes an API endpoint that returns sensitive device information without requiring authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated information disclosure",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain sensitive device information, including the device's serial number, vendor, product name, hardware ID, and firmware version. This information could be used to aid in further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with network access to the device can send an unauthenticated POST request to the `/api/external/7.0/system.System.get_infos` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device."
