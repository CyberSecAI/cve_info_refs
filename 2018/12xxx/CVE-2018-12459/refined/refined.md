Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12459:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an inconsistent `bits_per_raw_sample` value within the `ff_mpeg4_decode_picture_header` function in `libavcodec/mpeg4videodec.c`. This inconsistency arises when the `bits_per_raw_sample` is not properly reset after a previous instance, leading to a conflict with the current state of the decoder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is an improper handling of the `bits_per_raw_sample` variable, where its value might carry over from a previous decoding context when it shouldn't. This leads to an inconsistent state that can trigger an assertion failure during the decoding process. Specifically, the code fails to clear the `bits_per_raw_sample` when not switching to a studio profile and if the `bits_per_raw_sample` is not equal to 8.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial of service (DoS). When a specially crafted AVI file is processed, it can trigger an assertion violation within the decoding process, causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted AVI file. An attacker can prepare a malicious AVI file designed to trigger the inconsistent state in the `bits_per_raw_sample`, thereby crashing the decoding process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a crafted AVI file. User interaction is required in order to open the crafted file, however the attacker is not required to have any special privileges.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing with AFLSmart.
- The provided commit `2fc108f` addresses this by resetting the `bits_per_raw_sample` to 0 in the described scenario.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5, which indicates a high impact on availability, but no impact on confidentiality or integrity.
