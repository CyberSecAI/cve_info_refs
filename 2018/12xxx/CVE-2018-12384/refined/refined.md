Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a change in how `ServerHello.random` is generated in Network Security Services (NSS) when handling SSLv2-compatible `ClientHello` messages.
- Specifically, the generation of the `ServerHello.random` value was moved to the `ssl3_HandleClientHello()` function as part of the initial TLS 1.3 implementation. This change inadvertently removed a call to `ssl3_GetNewRandom()` when processing SSLv2-compatible `ClientHello` messages.
- As a result, when the server receives an SSLv2-compatible `ClientHello`, it doesn't generate a new random value and instead sends an all-zero value for `ServerHello.random`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Server-Side Randomness:** The primary vulnerability is that the server doesn't generate fresh entropy when processing SSLv2-compatible ClientHello messages, leading to a `ServerHello.random` that's always zero.
- **Malleability of ClientHello:** This lack of server-generated randomness allows for the malleability of the `ClientHello`. While the Finished message prevents complete tampering, it exposes the server to downgrade attacks.
- **Key Synchronization Issues:** Duplicate `ClientHello.random` values combined with the server's zeroed `ServerHello.random` result in identical key exchange signatures, pre-master secrets, and Finished values.
- **Downgrade Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to force a server to use the weakest configuration it is willing to operate, potentially leading to a downgrade to less secure protocol versions or cipher suites.
- **Replay Attacks:** The attacker can replay the `ClientHello` and subsequent messages to the server, which can lead to very bad failure modes if stream ciphers are used.
- **SLOTH variant attack**: If the client supports a weak hash and the server reuses its DH share the server becomes a signing oracle because it doesn't contribute any randomness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Downgrade to Weak Configurations:** The most significant impact is the potential for an attacker to force a server to downgrade to a weaker security configuration, such as older SSL/TLS versions and weaker cipher suites, making the connection susceptible to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Replay Attacks:** An attacker can replay the client hello and subsequent messages, which can result in various failures. This is particularly bad for stream ciphers such as RC4 and GCM.
- **Key Synchronization Issues**: Because the server sends all zero randoms, keys are no longer unique between handshakes.
- **SLOTH attack variant**: If a client uses a weak hash and a server reuses it's DH share, the lack of server randomness turns the server into a signing oracle.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned as a MitM can intercept and modify the `ClientHello` message, forcing the server to generate a zeroed `ServerHello.random`.
- **Replay Attacks:** An attacker can replay previously captured `ClientHello` and server responses because the keys generated with the zeroed random value are not unique.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
- **MitM Position:** The attacker must be positioned to act as a MitM in order to modify the handshake messages.
- **SSLv2 ClientHello:** The attacker needs to be able to force a client to use SSLv2-compatible `ClientHello` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in an early commit for the TLS 1.3 implementation (bug 1057463).
- Firefox is not directly affected, as its use of NSS as a server is limited to DTLS and test code, and DTLS is not affected by this particular problem.
- The fix includes an option to disable the SSLv2-compatible ClientHello to prevent the vulnerability (the default setting for this option is disabled).
- The recommended fix for older branches that must keep SSLv2 support is to restore the generation of new random values when processing SSLv2-compatible ClientHello messages.
- The initial plan to obscure the fix to delay exploits was abandoned because it increased the maintenance overhead.
