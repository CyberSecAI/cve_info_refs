This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483128#c0)â€¢ 6 years ago |
|  | |

When we added the very first support for TLS 1.3 in [bug 1057463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1057463 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement TLS 1.3"), that moved the generation of the ServerHello.random to ssl3\_HandleClientHello():
<https://searchfox.org/nss/diff/e89d3055c719e257017518b56dff5cf4b7f6d480/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c#8109>
Unfortunately, that removed the call to ssl3\_GetNewRandom() on the server side when handling an SSLv2-compatible ClientHello. It was previously in ssl3\_SendServerHello(). Now, if an SSLv2-compatible ClientHello is received, the server doesn't generate a new random: it sends an all-zero value.
This results in full malleability of the ClientHello. The only restrictions are minor: an attacker can't negotiate TLS 1.3, an extended master secret, or to include the downgrade SCSV if it is reducing the version.
That means the server is exposed to almost arbitrary downgrade. An attacker can cause a server to use the weakest configuration it is willing to operate. However, this does not appear to result in a compromise of the pre-master secret, because an honest client is involved in generating either a DH share or the pre-master secret (for static RSA).
No fresh entropy from the server means that the server doesn't verify that the client is live. Duplicate ClientHello.random values result in identical key exchange signatures, pre-master secrets, and Finished values. The attacks in RFC 7627 are probably a subset of what is possible.
Unless I've missed something, this has no obvious mitigation other than fixing the code. Support for a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello cannot be disabled in configuration. And we don't have our TLS 1.3 downgrade measures in place, which would be effective here. As long as a server accepts TLS 1.2 or lower, it's vulnerable to attack.
I have a fix, and I can try to hide that fix under other work related to the release of RFC 8446, but this is hard to hide.
We might also want to check - as a client - for an all-zero ServerHello.random.
I believe that Firefox is not affected. Our only use of NSS as a server is in DTLS and test code. DTLS isn't affected by this problem.
We'll need a CVE on this one. And new releases for any NSS version in the last 3 years that we still intend to support.

[Bug 1483129 - TLS 1.3 RFC version, r?ekr](attachment.cgi?id=8999836)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8999836&action=edit)

This retains the ability to negotiate draft versions of DTLS 1.3, but uses the
final RFC version for TLS 1.3.
This also refactors the handling of the downgrade sentinel. As we've discovered
- to our dismay - some MitM boxes forward handshake messages when they
shouldn't. This could result in triggering the downgrade sentinel. I've done
two things here:
- The server always sets the sentinel. It reduces the assumed version if it
only supports a draft version though on the basis that the client might
expect the full version.
- The client has a new option SSL\_ENABLE\_HELLO\_DOWNGRADE\_CHECK which is disabled
by default. The client will reject a handshake that appears to be a downgrade
only when this is explicitly enabled. The client will allow an apparent
downgrade to TLS 1.2 if it is running a draft version of TLS 1.3.
The allowance for a draft version is now only effective for DTLS 1.3.
Tests for version downgrade have been updated and enabled. These were rotten in
a few ways, but nothing dramatic.

This is indeed bad.
That said, I think your analysis isn't \*quite\* right. Because of the Finished, the attacker cannot tamper with the CH and have the outcome be acceptable to either client or server; the client's Finished will not verify and then neither will the server's. And because the server just signs over the random values, tampering with the CH isn't detectable at the SKE stage either.
The best attack I know of is that the attacker can replay the CH and any subsequent messages to the server. If you are using a block cipher, it's just a replay attack, but if you are using a stream cipher (RC4 or GCM) then of course you get very bad failure modes.

Note that the attack in c2 only works if the client offers a SSLv2 CH, because if the client offers an SSLv3 CH, then you go down the right code path.

Added an extra test for the downgrade sentinel before enabling false
start.
I have associated this with [BUg 1483128](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483128 "RESOLVED FIXED - ServerHello.random is all zero when handling a v2-compatible ClientHello") to keep this hidden until we have a plan
for landing fixes.

Yeah, the key synchronization seems like it is still a problem, but Finished prevents the ClientHello from being malleable. No sane client enables false start in the conditions under which this would be a problem for that either.

Bob,
This likely affects RedHat more than it does us. It affects servers.
Can you let us know how you would like us to manage the fix? The patches I have here are sufficient, and they disguise the issue somewhat, but we could also just disable the SSLv2-compatible ClientHello.
We would prefer to land the TLS 1.3 version changes soon, but we want to make sure we take the time to get everything in place and can wait until everything is ready if necessary.
Thanks.Flags: needinfo?(rrelyea)

Thanks for identifying the issue.
I think martin can land his patches, but we shouldn't open this bug up until Red Hat security response can evaluate which releases we need to backport the issue.
We'll need to carry the fix in our older versions of RHEL (old versions of java still use this SSLv3 Hello). I think disabling SSLv2 hello in newer versions is fine (so having it disabled by default would be prefered).
By disable I prefer, "recognizing an SSL v2 hello and rejecting the connection".Flags: needinfo?(rrelyea)

Let's give the security response people some time, just in case we have trouble. In particular, we need to know which versions of NSS require fixes. And what sort of fix is appropriate for each.
That is, for those older versions of RHEL, are you looking to ship NSS 3.39 (i.e., the current version), or are you OK with continuing to ship older NSS releases? Ideally, the fix on NSS trunk is removal of the v2 hello support, though older branches could have a smaller correctness fix.
I don't want to add and maintain an option for this if at all possible.

I think landing the disclosed changes are fine. Daiki would like to pick up the fix for our existing NSS releases.

We likely won't freeze NSS at any level until we pass the point where we need to support firefox on those platforms (for most libraries, we just freeze support, but because we need to keep firefox on a supported version, we need to rebase whenever we pick up a new version of ESR). I don't know the time frame for when we can drop firefox support on those releases (RHEL 6 is the issue).
For RHEL 8, I think we just disable v2 Hello support (so it will never be in the OS). I think we can deprecate the support in RHEL 7 (hopefully). The issue with RHEL 6 is we ship components that send ssl v2 hello messages to connect with SSL3, so we can't just turn it off in RHEL 6.
Initially for RHEL 7, we need to put the random fix in, and then turn SSL v2 hello off in a normal RHEL 7 release cycle (not in an async security fix patch).
Upshot: for the foreseeable future we'll need to keep some form of ssl v2 hello support in. When we EOL firefox support on RHEL 6, then we can drop it altogether. For the rest of the code base it should be turned off.

OK, Daiki, if you are going to work on a fix for older branches, I will wait for that before landing any of these changes (which do not disable the v2 ClientHello) until that is ready.
It's unfortunate, but if we are going to start to phase this out in the way you describe here, then we'll need an option. Compile- or run-time makes little difference to the maintenance overheads, so I'll leave that to you.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Maybe easily. The exploit is a key synchronization problem as a result of missing code. The missing code is restored by this patch, but the title of the patch is unrelated. (It's a fairly attractive patch title, as far as they go, but prosaic enough.)
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D3581> is similarly unrelated, though it disables the affected feature. I will request sec-approval for that too.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? Every NSS release in the past 3 years!
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? This was an early commit for [bug 1057463](/show_bug.cgi?id=1057463 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement TLS 1.3").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? The patch in <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D3581> also fixes the problem by disabling the affected code. A smaller targeted patch is easy enough, though upgrading NSS is generally a better strategy. A targeted patch will highlight the problem.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? Not significantly. The affected code is otherwise well-tested. Testing for randomness is tricky, that's all.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? Not very. It disables the code entirely, as we might be expected to do anyway. There's a lot of code to explore to find it, and it's not the usual sort of problem (buffer overrun, UMR, UAF, etc...) That it is on a security sensitive bug number is a red flag, but finding the problem isn't trivial.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? Everything in the past 3 years.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? See [Comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483128#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - ServerHello.random is all zero when handling a v2-compatible ClientHello").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? Backporting this is relatively trivial. Backporting a targeted fix will paint a nice red target on the problem, but it is possible.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? This is trivial code.

Karthik, Benjamin, and I talked through this today.
Here's our initial analysis:
1. My analysis in c2 is mostly correct.
2. It probably \*is\* possible to get False Start with an SSLv2 CH (if you just don't supply any groups, I believe we assume you just support the ones we support). However, the server can't write at this point, and the client's Finished precedes the clients' data and that should cause a Finished failure
3. We don't believe that it's possible to take an SSLv3 CH and by modifying the record headers make it an acceptable SSLv2 CH. The reason is that the 2nd byte of the SSLv2CH is the version and must be 3, but that is the first byte of the 3-byte length in SSLv3 CH and nobody sends an SSLv3 CH that is 65K long.
4. If the client supports a weak hash, and the server reuses its DH share (as NSS does for ECDH) you are susceptible to a SLOTH variant because the server doesn't contribute any randomness and therefore can be used as a signing oracle if you can produce a hash collision.
Two more notes:
1. I'm not entirely sure why I moved this and I wonder if we could just move it back to the code to send the server hello. MT, can you check and see if we need it at any time before that?
2. I note that we do less sanity checking of the SSLv2 CH message than we could. In particular (a) we don't check the message type and (b) we don't check that the SID isn't a crazy length. We should probably do both of these.

Yeah, we won't issue a Firefox advisory (it should go in NSS release notes, maybe some other RedHat announcements), but as a mozilla.org project NSS falls under our CVE issuing role.

> 1. I'm not entirely sure why I moved this and I wonder if we could just move it back to the code to send the server hello. MT, can you check and see if we need it at any time before that?
Yes, we're OK. The variable isn't read until it's written out in ssl3\_SendServerHello. I will move the code back there.
The nice thing about moving it is that it hides the bug much better.
> 2. I note that we do less sanity checking of the SSLv2 CH message than we could. In particular (a) we don't check the message type and (b) we don't check that the SID isn't a crazy length. We should probably do both of these.
Yes, but I'm just disabling that code instead. We can fix those later.

Historically, there have been NSS release notes but we haven't issued NSS only advisories as Mozilla. When we have written advisories for NSS, it has been code that affected Firefox and we issued them within the Firefox advisories for the release of Firefox with which it shipped.

I haven't yet seen advice from RH/Huzaifa about their requested timing for fixing this in RHEL.
RH isn't ready yet. We don't have the backported patch yet. There has been no decision yet where to backport it.
At this time, you want to land a fix into NSS trunk, which gets consumed by NSS 3.39 and Firefox 63, only.
You're obscuring the fix. It's expected that it will take attackers a while until they understand the issue and how to exploit it.
Based on that, I think it's OK for Mozilla to go ahead and land the obscured fix into NSS trunk and FF 63, without waiting for RH.
Thanks for not yet talking about the issue in public. This will give us a few more weeks of time to prepare a rollout of backports of the fix.
I suspect that we missed the deadline for adding a fix to the ESR 60.3 release that will go out at the same time as FF 63.
We'll require backports for NSS 3.36.x, used by ESR 60. It could target ESR 60.4.
It depends on feedback from Huzaifa and RH's security team, if fixes for older branches are requested, too.Flags: needinfo?(kaie)

It's probably obvious, but just be clear, when backporting to 3.36.x and older, we'll need to keep support for v2 compatible CH.

This isn't going to work for 3.36, which is stuck way back on -23. I tried, but it's too much code to integrate. So I have a patch that will move the randomness back in. That's going to make this a little obvious, so I will leave it to the RH folks to sort out when they want it (noting again that we don't need the fix in Firefox, so ESR timing doesn't matter).

Regarding what Red Hat needs: I've recently verified that OpenSSL 1.1.1 still supports SSLv2 Hello so I'd be vary of removing it in RHEL-8 releases. It definitely has to stay in RHEL-7 and earlier. We will probably be able to remove it completely only with the removal of TLS 1.0, and deprecate it with deprecation of TLS 1.0.

We can't easily test that ClientHello.random and ServerHello.random are truly

The patch I just landed disables the SSLv2-compatible ClientHello by default. I think that's the right setting for new deployments. I'm happy to have it retained (modulo fixing the problems in [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483128#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - ServerHello.random is all zero when handling a v2-compatible ClientHello")) behind the option for some time; if RHEL-8 needs this on by default, though I would discourage doing that, then RH will need to maintain a patch for the default value.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
