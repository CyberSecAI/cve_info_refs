Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-12206:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper configuration of hardware access in Intel(R) QuickAssist Technology for Linux.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Incorrect hardware access configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
Local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An authenticated local user is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Intel(R) QuickAssist Technology for Linux.
*   The CVSS base score is 3.2, indicating a low severity.
*   The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** Exploitation requires specialized conditions.
    *  **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No privileges are required, but the advisory states that an authenticated user is needed. This discrepancy should be noted and may warrant further investigation.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:C (Scope: Changed):** The vulnerability can affect resources beyond the attacker's control.
    *   **C:N (Confidentiality Impact: None):** There is no impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity Impact: None):** There is no impact on integrity.
    *   **A:L (Availability Impact: Low):** There is a low impact on availability, which aligns with denial of service.
*   Intel recommends evaluating section 3.1.4 of the R4.3.0 IntelÂ® QuickAssist for Linux Release Notes for potential changes to VM deployment environments to mitigate the vulnerability.
