- Root cause of vulnerability: DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in the Whale browser installer.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the installer searches for DLLs.
- Attack vectors: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer searches for DLLs.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the ability to write to a location on the file system that is searched by the installer when loading DLL files.
