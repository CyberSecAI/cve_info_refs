|  |  |
|  | [Description] |
|  | An issue was discovered in Cloud Media Popcorn A-200 03-05-130708-21-POP-411-000 firmware. |
|  | It is configured to provide TELNET remote access (without a password) that |
|  | pops a shell as root. If an attacker can connect to port 23 on the device, he can |
|  | completely compromise it. |

|  | CVE-2018-12073 |
|  |  |
|  | > [Description] |
|  | > An issue was discovered on Eminent EM4544 9.10 devices. |
|  | > The device does not require the user's current password to set a new |
|  | > one within the web interface. Therefore, it is possible to exploit |
|  | > this issue (e.g., in combination with a successful XSS, or at an unattended workstation) to change the |
|  | > admin password to an attacker-chosen value without knowing the |
|  | > current password. |
|  | > |
|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > |
|  | > [VulnerabilityType Other] |
