# XSS for Markdown elements where [[\_TOC\_]] is enabled

**Via HackerOne**
<https://hackerone.com/reports/353713>

# Summary

In wiki, the filter for replacing a `[[_TOC_]]` with Table of Contents is enabled.

I'm pretty certain the issue is here:

```
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/lib/banzai/filter/table_of_contents_filter.rb#L69
```

```
result[:toc] << %Q{<li><a href="##{header_node.href}">#{header_node.text}</a>}
```

What's basically happens here is that `.text` has the value as a text-item, so `<` would not be as entities, but instead as the real `<`. So by creating the following content on a wiki-page:

```
[[_TOC_]]
# &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)&gt;
```

The TOC will be generated, but the escaped img-tag will be rendered, and the onerror-attribute will trigger, running the javascript provided:

{F298848}

### Mitigation

Make sure the content of the anchor is still escaped when moved to the TOC.

## Impact

This is a pretty bad issue, since this creates a stored XSS on every place the TOC filter is enabled, the Wiki being one.
