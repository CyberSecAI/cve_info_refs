  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Brickstream line of sensors exposes sensitive information via URLs",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, potentially including IP settings and data delivery configurations.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing specific URLs on the sensor's web interface (e.g., /basic.html#ipsettings and /basic.html#datadelivery)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device."
