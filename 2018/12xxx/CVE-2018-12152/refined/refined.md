Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12152:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a pointer corruption issue within the Unified Shader Compiler of Intel Graphics Drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to pointer corruption in the Unified Shader Compiler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary WebGL code due to the pointer corruption.
- This can lead to escalation of privileges and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.
- The Intel advisory mentions also "denial of service" but it's for different CVEs

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- Unauthenticated remote user: The Intel advisory indicates this vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote user via local access.
- WebGL code execution: Maliciously crafted WebGL code can trigger the pointer corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but must be able to achieve local access.
- The attack involves crafting malicious WebGL code to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is specific to Intel Graphics Drivers before versions 10.18.x.5056 (aka 15.33.x.5056), 10.18.x.5057 (aka 15.36.x.5057) and 20.19.x.5058 (aka 15.40.x.5058)
- The vulnerability was reported by Piotr Bania of Cisco TALOS.
- Apple also lists this CVE as a vulnerability in macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and macOS Mojave 10.14.6 with same description "Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved input validation." in the Graphics component.
