Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that favicons from websites visited in Firefox for Android's private browsing mode were being cached in the `cache/icons` folder, the same location used for regular browsing mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the failure to isolate cached favicons of private browsing sessions from the persistent disk cache. This breaks the expectation of privacy in private browsing mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact is the leakage of information regarding sites visited during private browsing sessions. An attacker with access to the device's filesystem could potentially determine which websites a user visited in private mode by examining the contents of the `cache/icons` folder. It also reveals the number of page loads because each unique page seems to save a new entry for the touch-icon.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local file system access on the Android device. An attacker would need to gain access to the device's file system in order to read the cache folder. This could be done by installing a malicious app or with other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the Android device's file system.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was specific to Firefox for Android and did not affect desktop versions.
- The fix involved preventing favicons from private tabs from being written to the disk cache. Instead, they are kept in the memory cache.
- The fix also addressed the fact that the "Add Page Shortcut" feature was not using the memory cache in private mode.
- The bug report also discusses a separate issue where the "Clear private data on exit" setting did not clear the icon cache, which was addressed in a separate bug report.
