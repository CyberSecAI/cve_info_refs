Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12848:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **out-of-bounds write** issue found within the `JP2KLib.dll`, a library used by Adobe Acrobat and Reader to parse JPEG2000 images. The specific vulnerable code is located within the `JP2KImageDecodeTileInterleaved` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The vulnerability allows writing data outside the bounds of allocated memory. The specific cause of this write is not detailed but likely involves a flaw in how the JPEG2000 data is handled during decoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine, leading to a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted JPEG2000 file ('.jp2' extension).
*   This could be achieved through a malicious PDF document embedding such a crafted '.jp2' image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious JPEG2000 file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the target, typically by embedding it in a PDF document and persuading the victim to open it with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
*   The attacker must understand the parsing process to create an input which causes the out of bounds write. This was achieved by the researchers by reverse engineering the JP2KLib.dll library and building a harness that allows fuzzing specific functions of the library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzing approach.
*   The researchers used WinAFL, a coverage-guided fuzzer for Windows, to discover the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found during a fuzzing campaign of the `JP2KLib.dll` library, which is used to parse JPEG2000 files.
*   The vulnerability is classified as **critical** by Adobe.
*   Check Point Research was involved in finding and reporting this vulnerability to Adobe.
*   The researchers also mentioned that the bug was found shortly after it was exploited in the wild, which highlights the importance of fuzzing and security research.
*   The provided document contains a detailed technical explanation of how the researchers performed the fuzzing and wrote the required harnesses.
