The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12478.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `obs-service-replace_using_package_version` service allows specifying arbitrary input files, instead of limiting the input to files within the package directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** The service can read files from anywhere on the filesystem, not just the package directory.
- **File Copying:** The service copies the specified arbitrary file into the package directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to copy sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/fstab`) into a package.
- **Private File Exposure:** By including sensitive files in a package, an attacker could potentially commit them to a public repository exposing them.
- **Attack Vector for Other Vulnerabilities:** An attacker could use this to copy malicious files or configuration into a package.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to specify a file path outside the intended package directory.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the service's parameters by modifying `<services>` block.
    - Specifically, the `<param name="file">` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to influence the service configuration, specifically the parameters of the `replace_using_package_version` service. This likely requires being able to modify the service definition that the affected package uses.
