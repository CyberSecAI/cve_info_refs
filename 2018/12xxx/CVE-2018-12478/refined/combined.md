| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-13 08:37:58 UTC  ``` This source service allows to specify arbitrary input files e.g.:  ``` <services> 	<service name="replace_using_package_version"> 		<param name="file">/etc/fstab</param> 		<param name="replacement">YYY</param> 		<param name="regex">XXX</param> 	</service> </services> ```  This will copy /etc/fstab into the package directory. It could be used to trick a user into committing private files to a package or otherwise construct attacks.  The service should only process files from the package directory. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-26 11:31:22 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2018-12478 for this issue ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c2)  Flavio Castelli   2018-09-27 10:15:53 UTC  ``` Why have I been assigned to this issue? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-27 10:32:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Flavio Castelli from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c2)) > Why have I been assigned to this issue?  It turns out there is no maintainer for this package and `osc maintainer -e obs-service-replace_using_package_version` shows you as bugowner, inherited from the Virtualization:containers project where this package lives in.  Can you find somebody to handle this? Otherwise adrian might have an idea who can deal with it. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c4)  Flavio Castelli   2018-10-02 12:57:34 UTC  ``` I have no idea about who wrote that. We definitely need Adrian to sort this out :) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2018-10-04 14:13:39 UTC  ``` the lets route it to him ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1108280#c7)  Malte Kraus   2019-08-01 13:30:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1143669](show_bug.cgi?id=1143669 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |
