This PR fixes XSS vulnerabilities in dashboard link components. This happens when you put html with XSS as a link title, like `<img src='' onerror=alert("XSS") />` in

Panel -> General -> Drilldown / detail link -> Title or

Dashboard -> Links -> Tooltip

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hello, good to see a PR. I found this vulnerability when I typed XSS in the Drilldown / detail link in the title field. After filling in the title field the dashboard field was automatically filled with the same value (XSS). When adding the detail link and hovering over the information icon, the XSS was also executed. |

Code looks good and it fixes XSS problems with link titles and tooltips.

Would be nice with some XSS tests for the link\_srv though.

I tried and added `javascript:alert('XSS')` to the url (for absolute url's) and clicking such a link executes the javascript. Don't know if we should create a separate issue for that or try to solve it in this. What do you think?
