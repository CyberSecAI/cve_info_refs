Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2018-12234:

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Product:** Adrenalin HRMS Software
*   **Affected Version:** 5.4.0
*   **Root Cause:** The application echoes user-supplied input containing JavaScript code back in the HTML response without proper output encoding.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code as a parameter value (`strAction`). The victim must be tricked into visiting the crafted URL.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the victim's browser, enabling them to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially hijacking the user's session and gaining complete access to their account.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website, which could contain browser exploits or phishing pages.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding of user-supplied input.
*   **Remediation:**
    *   HTML encode untrusted data before inserting it into HTML elements.
    *   HTML attribute encode untrusted data before inserting it into HTML attributes.
    *   JavaScript encode untrusted data before inserting it into JavaScript code, or place data in an HTML element and retrieve it at runtime.
    *   URL encode untrusted data before inserting it into a URL query string.
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
