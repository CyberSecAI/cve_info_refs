The provided content discusses two separate issues within the `ltb-project/self-service-password` repository, which are related to LDAP and user input validation.

**Issue #209: Check ldap_bind return code instead of relying on ldap_errno**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code was relying on `ldap_errno` to detect errors after calling `ldap_bind`. However, as noted in a PHP bug report (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76469), `ldap_errno` might not be set correctly after an error in `ldap_bind`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect error handling of `ldap_bind` could lead to application logic failing to detect errors during authentication. This could result in unexpected behavior when binding to LDAP and potentially bypass authentication.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Failure to detect a bind error could lead to authentication bypass if not handled correctly.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker could attempt to exploit the error by providing invalid credentials or causing an error condition that would make `ldap_bind` fail, but might not be detected by the application if it only checks `ldap_errno`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply data to the `ldap_bind` function via the application's user input interface.

**Issue #211: Force string conversion of input values**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application was not properly validating or sanitizing user input values before using them in LDAP operations. Passing non-string objects such as arrays or other PHP objects to LDAP functions, such as `ldap_bind` , could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation on user-provided data could lead to attacks where unexpected types are passed to LDAP functions.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Passing non-string data to LDAP functions might lead to errors, unexpected behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities if the LDAP functions do not handle these types properly or if this behavior can be exploited in some way.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker could provide malicious data (arrays, objects etc) via user input fields that are used in the LDAP functions.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply data to the application's user input interface.

**CVE Relevance:**

Based on the provided information, it's not possible to determine if either issue directly corresponds to CVE-2018-12421, as the CVE description is not provided. However, both issues do represent security vulnerabilities involving input validation and LDAP, and such issues could be assigned a CVE. More context is needed to verify if either of these specific issues relates to the specified CVE.

The two issues highlight the following important security considerations:

1.  **Error Handling:** Ensure proper error checking of return codes, especially when dealing with external APIs, as relying solely on error codes or variables may not be enough.
2.  **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Sanitize and validate user input to prevent unexpected data types from being passed to vulnerable functions. Force string conversion when the input is expected to be a string.

Given the information, neither of these issues directly describe CVE-2018-12421 as the content only describes the code fixes in place to avoid errors in ldap_bind and object injection and does not provide any information on the actual exploit, therefore, the response is: NOINFO
