## Description

[![@coudot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/883396?v=4&size=48)](/coudot)[coudot](https://github.com/coudot)opened [on Jun 13, 2018](https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password/issues/209#issue-332053474)

As it can be seen in the issue open on php.pnet, the ldap\_errno is not filled if there was an error when calling ldap\_bind: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76469>

We have a PR [#208](https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password/pull/208) that is workaround by checking that parameters are strings, but this does not prevent another ldap\_bind error.

We need to check ldap\_bind return code before looking at ldap\_errno.

To avoid attacks with input values (using arrays or another PHP object), we should force string conversion.
