Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Adrenalin 5.4 HRMS software.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically special characters like `<`, `>`, `/`, etc.
- This input is reflected back in the HTML response within JavaScript code without proper output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The vulnerability lies in how the application handles user input, directly reflecting it back without sanitization.
- Lack of output encoding: The application does not encode special characters, allowing them to be interpreted as executable code by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: Attackers can steal user session cookies and tokens, gaining complete access to their accounts.
- Redirection to malicious sites: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that may contain browser exploits or phishing pages.
- Malicious script execution: Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, which may lead to various malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `prntDDLCntrlName` parameter.
- The user must be tricked into clicking the malicious URL for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the crafted malicious link. This could be via social engineering or some other method.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `prntDDLCntrlName` within the `/ShiftEmployeeSearch.aspx` page.
- A proof of concept URL is provided that uses the parameter to inject javascript:
`/ShiftEmployeeSearch.aspx?popToken=emp&prntFrmName=FrmAdhocMapping&prntDDLCntrlName=hdnEmpSearch20237%22%3balert(1)%2f%2f154&HRShow=0&CntrlType=txt`
