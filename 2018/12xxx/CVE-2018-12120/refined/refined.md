Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-12120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Node.js debugger, when enabled with `node --debug` or `node debug`, listens on port 5858 on all network interfaces by default. This behavior exposes the debugger to remote connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unprotected Primary Channel (CWE-419): The debugger port was not restricted to localhost, making it accessible from any network interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Remote computers could attach to the debug port and evaluate arbitrary JavaScript code. This could lead to complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the machine running Node.js with the debugger enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach port 5858 of the machine running the vulnerable Node.js application.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron") are vulnerable.

**Fixed Versions:**
-  The debugger was removed in Node.js 8 and replaced with the inspector, so no versions from 8 and later are vulnerable. The default behavior of the debugger was changed to listen on localhost only in the fixed version of Node.js 6.
