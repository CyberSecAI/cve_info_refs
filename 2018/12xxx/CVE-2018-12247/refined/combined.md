## Description

[![@clayton-shopify](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11052374?v=4&size=48)](/clayton-shopify)[clayton-shopify](https://github.com/clayton-shopify)opened [on Jun 5, 2018](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/issues/4036#issue-329585034)

The following input demonstrates a crash:

```
h = {}
a = []
200.times do |n|
a[0] = n
h[a] = 0
puts h.to_a.clone
end
```

Note that I was only able to reproduce this issue when building mruby on a 32-bit Linux system. (I used Ubuntu 16.04 for testing.) I could not reproduce on 64-bit Linux or 64-bit macOS.
