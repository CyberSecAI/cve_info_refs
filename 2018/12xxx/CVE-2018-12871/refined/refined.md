Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successfully exploiting the out-of-bounds read vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This could potentially expose internal memory structures, or other data that could be used in subsequent attacks.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: While the specific vulnerability is categorized as an out-of-bounds read, the document also notes that a successful exploit of such vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, although it is not the primary impact of the specific CVE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted PDF file.
- The vulnerability is present in the JPEG2000 image parsing library (JP2KLib.dll) used by Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file to a victim who will open it with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader. This could involve:
    - Sending the malicious PDF via email.
    - Hosting the file on a malicious website.
    - Persuading the user to open a PDF in any other means.
- No special network position is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzing technique.
- The research paper details the process of setting up a fuzzer and developing a harness for the JP2KLib.dll library.
- The specific vulnerability was found in the JP2K parser, which is a complex binary format parser.
- The document lists this CVE, among other similar CVEs, as part of a batch of vulnerabilities found through fuzzing.
- The document also notes that while the research was conducted on older versions, the vulnerability may be present in more current builds, until patched by Adobe.

The document provides a great deal of context on the research methods used to uncover this vulnerability, as well as its general impact, but does not specifically describe the specific code execution path for the vulnerability.
