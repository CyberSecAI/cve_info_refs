Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the C++ name demangler, a part of the libiberty library, which is used by GNU binutils. Specifically, the `demangle_template` function in `cplus-dem.c` has a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple memory corruptions are present in the C++ name demangler
- Improper handling of specially crafted binaries
- Vulnerable code is within the `demangle_template` function of the `cplus-dem.c` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by causing a crash in `objdump` and/or other affected tools.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- By tricking a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted binary file (ELF, object, PE).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file that will be processed by a vulnerable version of binutils' objdump or other tools that use the vulnerable library.
- No special privileges needed for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a binutils issue, but later identified to be within the libiberty library, which is part of the GCC project.
- The fix was applied to the libiberty library in commit 266886.
- The issue was discovered using a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer.
- The vulnerability was triggered using the `objdump` tool with the `--dwarf-check -C -g -f -dwarf -x` options.
