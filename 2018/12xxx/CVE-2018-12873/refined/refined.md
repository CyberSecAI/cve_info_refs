The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-12873.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2018-12873 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This means the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure. Specifically, an attacker may be able to read sensitive information from memory that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted file (likely a PDF with a malicious JPEG2000 image), which triggers the vulnerable code in the JP2KLib.dll library. The research from checkpoint.com indicates that this vulnerability can be found using a fuzzer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to the victim. The attacker does not need to be in any special position. User interaction is required to open the malicious file within Adobe Reader.

**Additional Notes:**
The Checkpoint research paper provides an in-depth look at the process of fuzzing the JP2KLib.dll. This includes:
- Reverse engineering and creating a harness for the library.
- Methodology for setting up and running the fuzzer, including corpus creation and minimization.
- Information about other CVEs found during the process is included, as well as details on how the researchers contributed to the WinAFL fuzzer.

The Adobe security bulletin confirms that this is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, and it lists the affected versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
