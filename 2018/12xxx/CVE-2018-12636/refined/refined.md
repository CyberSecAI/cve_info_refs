    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the 'orderby' parameter in the 'itsec-logs' page.",

      "SQL Injection (SQLi)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands.",

        "By crafting a malicious GET request to the 'itsec-logs' page with a manipulated 'orderby' parameter."

    "affected_product": "WordPress Plugin iThemes Security (better-wp-security)",
    "affected_versions": "<= 7.0.2",
    "fixed_version": "7.0.3",
    "technical_details": "The `$sort_by_column` variable, derived from the `orderby` GET parameter, is not escaped before being used in a SQL query. Specifically:\n\n```php\nFile: better-wp-security/core/admin-pages/logs-list-table.php\nLine 271: if ( isset( $_GET[' orderby '], $_GET['order'] ) ) {\nLine 272: $sort_by_column = $_GET[' orderby '];\n\nFile: better-wp-security/core/lib/log-util.php\nLine 168: $query .= ' ORDER BY ' . implode( ', ', $sort_by_column ));\n```\n\nThis allows an attacker to inject SQL code through the `orderby` parameter."
