Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) used for generating session IDs in ntopng is not seeded at program startup. This results in predictable session IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deterministic Session IDs:** Due to the lack of proper seeding, the PRNG produces the same sequence of "random" numbers each time the application starts, making session IDs predictable.
- **Insufficient Randomness:** The reliance on the unseeded `rand()` function from the standard C library leads to low entropy and predictable output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can predict and hijack a user's session, effectively bypassing authentication.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** By hijacking a user's session, the attacker gains the privileges associated with that user.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker gains access to the information accessible to the hijacked user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any valid credentials to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable ntopng instance.
- **Operating System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the operating system and the standard C library used by the target system.
- **Target User's Username:** The attacker needs to know the username of the user they intend to impersonate.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit code (provided in `ntopng_cve_poc.py`) demonstrates how to iterate through possible values of the unseeded `rand()` function and compute session IDs using a hash function along with the target username to test if a session ID is valid
- The fix involves seeding the PRNG with the current time using `gettimeofday()` function
- The vulnerability is present in ntopng versions prior to 3.4.180617.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity.
