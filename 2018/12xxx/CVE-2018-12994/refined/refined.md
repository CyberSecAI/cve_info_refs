The provided content describes a vulnerability in OneFileCMS related to arbitrary file creation and code execution.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "New File" functionality allows a user to create a file with an arbitrary name. The created file can then be edited, and arbitrary PHP code can be inserted and saved into the newly created file, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file creation: The application does not validate the file name, allowing the creation of PHP files.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application allows arbitrary PHP code to be saved within the created files.
- Direct code execution: The application executes the saved PHP code upon access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable OneFileCMS instance.
- Full system compromise: Depending on the user privileges and server configuration, the attacker may be able to gain full control over the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: The vulnerability can be exploited through the web interface of OneFileCMS by authenticated users.
- Direct HTTP requests: Once the file is created and saved, it can be directly accessed by an HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials for OneFileCMS to create a new file and edit it.
- The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable OneFileCMS instance.
