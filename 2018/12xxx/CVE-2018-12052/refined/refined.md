Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12052

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection (SQLi) flaw found in the `get_sec.php` file of the "Schools Alert Management Script" by PHP Scripts Mall.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `q` parameter passed to the `get_sec.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to the database, allowing an attacker to read sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
    - Data modification or deletion, potentially corrupting the application's database.
    - In some cases, complete compromise of the server could be achieved if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a network request, specifically by crafting a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable `get_sec.php` script and a SQL injection payload in the `q` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction for successful exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrates the SQL injection using a crafted URL:
  `/get_sec.php?q=1'+/*!50000union*/+select+1,/*!50000concat*/(user(),0x7e7e,database(),0x7e7e,@@version)%23`
- This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve database information (username, database name, and database version), confirming the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVSS score is 9.8/10, indicating a critical severity.
- The vulnerability is present in the PHP-based web application.
- The "Schools Alert Management Script" is a commercial product, and the exploit is publicly available.
- The vendor is PHP Scripts Mall.
- The issue was reported by "xiaotian.wang From DBAppSecurity" and published on GitHub by "unh3x".
