# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Poor RichFaces

RichFaces is one of the most popular component libraries for JavaServer Faces (JSF). In the past, two vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-2165 and CVE-2015-0279) have been found that allow RCE in versions 3.x ≤ 3.3.3 and 4.x ≤ 4.5.3. Code White discovered two new vulnerabilities which bypass the implemented mitigations. Thereby, all RichFaces versions including the latest 3.3.4 and 4.5.17 are vulnerable to RCE.

## Introduction

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a framework for building user interfaces for web applications. While there are only two major JSF implementations (i. e., Apache MyFaces and Oracle Mojarra), there are several component libraries, which provide additional UI components and features. RichFaces is one of the most popular libraries among these component libraries and since it became part of JBoss (and thereby also part of Red Hat), it is also part of several JBoss/Red Hat products, for example JBoss EAP and JBoss Portal.[[1]](#footnote-1)

RichFaces has three major version branches: 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x. However, as 5.x has never left alpha state, it is rather irrelevant. In early 2016, the [developers of RichFaces announced the end-of-life of RichFaces in June 2016](https://developer.jboss.org/people/michpetrov/blog/2016/02/12/the-future-of-richfaces). The latest releases of the respective branches are 3.3.4 and 4.5.17.

## The Past

In the past, two significant vulnerabilities have been discovered by Takeshi Terada of MBSD, which both affect various RichFaces versions:

CVE-2013-2165: Arbitrary Java Deserialization in RichFaces 3.x ≤ 3.3.3 and 4.x ≤ 4.3.2
Deserialization of arbitrary Java serialized object streams in *org.ajax4jsf.resource.ResourceBuilderImpl* allows remote code execution.
CVE-2015-0279: Arbitrary EL Evaluation in RichFaces 4.x ≤ 4.5.3 ([RF-13977](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-13977))
Injection of arbitrary EL method expressions in *org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource* allows remote code execution.

Both vulnerabilities rely on the feature to generate images, video, sounds, and other resources on the fly based on data provided in the request. The provided data is either interpreted as a plain array of bytes or as a Java serialized object stream. In RichFaces 3.x, the data gets appended to the URL path preceded by either `/DATB/` (byte array) or `/DATA/` (Java serialized object stream); in RichFaces 4.x, the data is transmitted in a request parameter named `db` (byte array) or `do` (Java serialized object stream). In all cases, the binary data is compressed using DEFLATE and then encoded using a URL-safe Base64 encoding.

### CVE-2013-2165: Arbitrary Java Deserialization

This vulnerability is a straight forward Java deserialization vulnerability. When a RichFaces 3.x resource is requested, it eventually gets processed by [`ResourceBuilderImpl.getResourceDataForKey(String)`](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org.richfaces.framework/richfaces-impl/3.3.4.Final/org/ajax4jsf/resource/ResourceBuilderImpl.java#ResourceBuilderImpl.getResourceDataForKey%28java.lang.String%29). If the requested resource key begins with `/DATA/`, the remaining data gets decoded and decompressed (using [`ResourceBuilderImpl.decrypt(byte[])`](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org.richfaces.framework/richfaces-impl/3.3.4.Final/org/ajax4jsf/resource/ResourceBuilderImpl.java#ResourceBuilderImpl.decrypt%28byte%5B%5D%29), which actually, despite its name, does not incorporate encryption[[2]](#footnote-2)) and finally deserialized without any further validation.

In RichFaces 4.x, it is basically the same: the *org.richfaces.resource.DefaultCodecResourceRequestData* holds the request data passed via `db`/`do` and [`Util.decodeObjectData(String)`](https://github.com/richfaces4/core/blob/4.3.2.20130513-Final/impl/src/main/java/org/richfaces/util/Util.java#L232-L248) is used in the latter case. That method then decodes and decompresses the data in a similar way and finally deserializes it without any further validation.

This can be exploited with [*ysoserial*](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) using a suitable gadget.

The arbitrary Java deserialization was patched in RichFaces 3.3.4 and 4.3.3 by introducing look-ahead deserialization with a limited set of whitelisted classes.[[3]](#footnote-3) Due to several aftereffects, the list was extended occasionally.[[4]](#footnote-4)

### CVE-2015-0279: Arbitrary EL Evaluation

The RichFaces issue [RF-13977](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/RF-13977) corresponding to this vulnerability is public and actually quite detailed. It describes that the RichFaces Showcase application utilizes the *MediaOutputResource* dynamic resource builder. The data object passed in the `do` URL parameter holds the state object, which is used by [`MediaOutputResource.restoreState(FacesContext, Object)`](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/4.5.3.Final/components/a4j/src/main/java/org/richfaces/resource/MediaOutputResource.java#L86-L94) to restore its state. This includes the *contentProducer* field, which is expected to be a *MethodExpression* object. That *MethodExpression* later gets invoked by [`MediaOutputResource.encode(FacesContext)`](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/4.5.3.Final/components/a4j/src/main/java/org/richfaces/resource/MediaOutputResource.java#L60-L63) to pass execution to the referenced method to generate the resource's contents. In the mentioned example, the EL method expression `#{mediaBean.process}` references the [*process* method of a Java Bean named *mediaBean*](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/blob/4.5.3.Final/examples/showcase/src/main/java/org/richfaces/demo/mediaOutput/MediaBean.java#L457-L479).

Now the problem with that is that the EL expression can be changed, even just with basic Linux utilities. There is no protection in place that would prevent one from tampering with it. Depending on the EL implementation, this allows arbitrary code execution, as demonstrated by the reporter:

However, exploitation of this vulnerability is not always that easy. Especially if there is no existing sample of a valid `do` state object that can be tampered with. Because if one would want to create the state object, it would require the use of compatible libraries, otherwise the deserialization may fail. Moreover, the EL implementation does not allow arbitrary expressions with parameterized invocations in method expressions as this has only just been added in EL 2.2. EL exploitation is quite an interesting topic in itself.

The [patch for this issue introduced in RichFaces 4.5.4](https://github.com/richfaces/richfaces/commit/4c5ddae4d6ddcea591fa949762c1c79ac11cac99) was to check the expression of the *contentProducer* whether it contains a parenthesis. This would prevent the invocation of methods with parameters like `loadClass("java.lang.Runtime")`.

## The Present

The kind of the past vulnerabilities led to the assumption that there may be a way to bypass the mitigations. And after some research, two ways were found to gain remote code execution in a similar manner also affecting the latest RichFaces versions 3.3.4 and 4.5.17:

RF-14310: Arbitrary EL Evaluation in RichFaces 3.x ≤ 3.3.4
Injection of arbitrary EL expressions allows remote code execution via *org.richfaces.renderkit.html.Paint2DResource*.
RF-14309: Arbitrary EL Evaluation in RichFaces 4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17
Injection of arbitrary EL variable mapper allows to bypass mitigation of CVE-2015-0279 and thereby remote code execution.

Although the issues RF-14309 and RF-14310 were discovered in the order of their identifier, we'll explain them in the opposite order. Also note that the issues are not public but only visible to persons responsible to resolve security issues.

### RF-14310: Arbitrary EL Evaluation

This vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2015-0279/RF-13799. While the injection of arbitrary EL expressions was possible right from the beginning, there is always a need to get them triggered somehow. This similarity was found in the [org.richfaces.renderkit.html.Paint2DResource](http://www.grepcode.com/file/repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org.richfaces.ui/richfaces-ui/3.3.4.Final/org/richfaces/renderkit/html/Paint2DResource.java/) class. When a resource of that type gets requested, its `send(ResourceContext)` method gets called. The resource data transmitted in the request must be an *org.richfaces.renderkit.html.Paint2DResource$ImageData* object. This passes the whitelisting as *ImageData* extends *org.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource*, which actually was introduced in 3.3.4 to fix the Java deserialization vulnerability.

### RF-14309: Arbitrary EL Evaluation

As the patch to CVE-2015-0279 introduced in 4.5.4 disallowed the use of parenthesis in the EL method expression of the *contentProducer*, it seemed like a dead end. But if you are fimilar with EL internals, you would know that they can have custom function mappers and variable mappers, which are used by the *ELResolver* to resolve functions (i. e., *name* in `${prefix:name()}`) and variables (i. e., *var* in `${var.property}`) to *Method* and *ValueExpression* instances respectively. Fortunately, various *VariableMapper* implementations were added to the whitelist starting with 4.5.3.[[5]](#footnotemark-5)

So to exploit this, all that is needed is to use a variable in the *contentProducer* method expression like `${dummy.toString}` and add an appropriate *VariableMapper* to the method expression that maps `dummy` to a *ValueExpression* of your choice.

## The Future

RichFaces has reached its end-of-life in June 2016 and their [RichFaces End-Of-Life Questions & Answers](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/RichFacesEnd-Of-LifeQuestionsAnswers) is pretty clear on the time thereafter:

> **What will happen if a serious bug or security issue is discovered in the future?**
>
> There will be no patches after the end of support. In case of discovering a serious issue you will have to develop a patch yourself or switch to another framework.
>
> – [RichFaces End-Of-Life Questions & Answers](https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/RichFacesEnd-Of-LifeQuestionsAnswers)

So we can't expect official patches.

## The Bonus

While looking for ways to exploit the recent versions of RichFaces, there were two classes in the JSF API 2.0 and later, which seemed promising:

* [*javax.faces.component.ValueBindingValueExpressionAdapter*](http://www.grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax.faces/jsf-api/2.0/javax/faces/component/ValueBindingValueExpressionAdapter.java)
* [*javax.faces.component.ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter*](http://www.grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax.faces/jsf-api/2.0/javax/faces/component/ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter.java)

The interesting thing about these classes is that they have a `equals(Object)` method, which eventually calls `getType(ELContext)` on a EL value expression. For example, if [`equals(Object)` gets called on a *ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter* object](http://www.grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax.faces/jsf-api/2.0/javax/faces/component/ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter.java#ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter.equals%28java.lang.Object%29) with a *ValueExpression* object as `other`, `getType(ELContext)` of `other` gets called. And as the value expression has to be evaluated to determine its resulting type, this can be used as a Java deserialization primitive to execute EL value expressions on deserialization.

This is very similar to the *Myfaces1* and *Myfaces2* gadgets in *ysoserial*.[[6]](#footnotemark-6) However, while they require Apache MyFaces, this one is independent from the JSF implementation and only requires a matching EL implementation.

Unfortunately, this gadget does not work for RichFaces. The reason for that is that *ValueExpressionValueBindingAdapter* needs to have a valid value binding as `getType(ELContext)` gets called first. But *javax.faces.el.ValueBinding* is not whitelisted. And wrapping it in a *StateHolderSaver* does not work because the state object is of type *Object[]* and therefore the cast to *Serializable[]* in [`StateHolderSaver.restore(FacesContext)`](http://www.grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.jboss.spec.javax.faces/jboss-jsf-api_2.1_spec/2.0.9.Final/javax/faces/component/StateHolderSaver.java#StateHolderSaver.restore%28javax.faces.context.FacesContext%29) fails.[[7]](#footnotemark-7) This is probably a bug in RichFaces as *Serializable[]* is not whitelisted either although *StateHolderSaver* uses *Serializable[]* internally on *StateHolder* instances.

## Conclusion

It has been shown that all RichFaces versions 3.x and 4.x including the latest 3.3.4 and 4.5.17 are exploitable by one or multiple vulnerabilities:

* RichFaces 3
  + 3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.3: CVE-2013-2165
  + 3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4: RF-14310
* RichFaces 4
  + 4.0.0 ≤ 4.3.2: CVE-2013-2165
  + 4.0.0 ≤ 4.5.4: CVE-2015-0279
  + 4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17: RF-14309

As we can't expect official patches, one way to mitigate all these vulnerabilities is to block requests to the concerned URLs:

* Blocking requests of URLs with paths containing `/DATA/` should mitigate CVE-2013-2165 and RF-14310.
* Blocking requests of URLs with paths containing `org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource` (literally or URL encoded) should mitigate CVE-2015-0279 and RF-14309.

* [7](#footnotemark-7) This actually depends on the JSF API implementation and version. For example, *org.jboss.spec.javax.faces/jboss-jsf-api\_2.1\_spec* and *org.glassfish/javax.faces* do have this unfortunate behavior in all versions while *com.sun.faces/jsf-api* added it in version 2.1.0.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# RichFaces exploitation toolkit

---

*From*: Red Timmy Security <publications () redtimmy com>

*Date*: Fri, 13 Mar 2020 21:29:47 +0100

---

```

Hi,

```
The RichFaces library has been vulnerable to many Java deserialization
and EL injection vulnerabilities. This infamous library is included with
many JSF web applications for providing advanced UI elements beyond the
(very limited) set that is built-in with the framework. Therefore, many
websites using JSF are vulnerable to exploitation.
```

```
Until now, the vulnerabilities had to be exploited manually. Richsploit
is a toolkit that can exploit multiple versions of RichFaces:
```

RichFaces 3
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.3   CVE-2013-2165
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-12533
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4   CVE-2018-14667
RichFaces 4
4.0.0 ≤ 4.3.2   CVE-2013-2165
4.0.0 ≤ 4.5.4   CVE-2015-0279
4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17  CVE-2018-12532

```
For more information, please read our blog post at:
<https://www.redtimmy.com/java-hacking/richsploit-one-tool-to-exploit-all-versions-of-richfaces-ever-released/>
```

```
The tool can be downloaded from GitHub:
<https://github.com/redtimmy/Richsploit>
```

Regards,
Red Timmy Security
