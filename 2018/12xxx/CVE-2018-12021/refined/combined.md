Greetings Singularity containerizers!

This release contains fixes for a *high severity* security issue affecting Singularity 2.3.0 through 2.5.1 on kernels that support overlay file systems ([CVE-2018-12021](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4x32-h296-rg6j "CVE-2018-12021")). A malicious user with network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information on disk and bypass directory image restrictions like those preventing the root file system from being mounted into the container.

Singularity 2.5.2 should be installed immediately, and all previous versions of Singularity should be removed. The vulnerability addressed in this release affects kernels that support overlayfs. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, you should set `enable overlay = no` in `singularity.conf`.

In addition, this release contains a large number of bug fixes. Details follow:

## [Security related fixes](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-12021)

* Removed the option to use overlay images with `singularity mount`. This

  flaw could allow a malicious user accessing the host system to access

  sensitive information when coupled with persistent ext3 overlay.
* Fixed a race condition that might allow a malicious user to bypass directory

  image restrictions, like mounting the host root filesystem as a container

  image

## Bug fixes

* Fix an error in malloc allocation [#1620](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1620)
* Honor debug flag when pulling from docker hub [#1556](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1556)
* Fix a bug with passwd abort [#1580](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1580)
* Allow user to override singularity.conf "mount home = no" with --home option

  [#1496](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1496)
* Improve debugging output [#1535](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1535)
* Fix some bugs in bind mounting [#1525](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1525)
* Define PR\_(S|G)ET\_NO\_NEW\_PRIVS in user space so that these features will

  work with kernels that implement them (like Cray systems) [#1506](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1506)
* Create /dev/fd and standard streams symlinks in /dev when using minimal dev

  mount or when specifying -c/-C/--contain option [#1420](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1420)
* Fixed \* expansion during app runscript creation [#1486](https://github.com/apptainer/singularity/pull/1486)

Subject: Singularity 3.1.0: CVE-2019-11328: namespace privilege escalation
 and arbitrary file corruption

Hello,

following is a report about a major security issue found in Singularity
[1] major version 3.1.

Introduction
============

Singularity is a Linux namespace based container solution often used in
HPC (high performance computing) environments. In the course of a code
review conducted for inclusion of the new Singularity major version 3 in
SUSE enterprise products I found a major security issue.

The issue affects Singularity versions >= 3.1.0 and it has recently been
fixed in an update to version 3.2.0 [2]. The issue was introduced via
upstream commit b4dcb0e4d77baa1c7647a4a5705ea824bb4e0dca [3].

Issue Details
=============

Singularity 3 uses a setuid root program called `starter-suid` for
setting up Singularity containers. The issue is that containers run as
background instances get bad directory permissions in path
`/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. The permission of
these directories is set to "<user>:root" with mode 0550.  Since the
unprivileged user is the owner of the directory it may change the mode
to arbitrary values and therefore also the content of the directory to
arbitrary content.

A result of this is that symlinks can be placed in the `ns`
sub-directory that will be followed when joining the container instance
and thus allow unprivileged users to enter arbitrary mnt, pid, net,
cgroup, uts and ipc namespaces. Only user namespaces cannot be joined,
because the `starter-suid` binary refuses to use user namespaces when
running in the setuid context. (`starter-suid` also contains logic that
is only intended for use when the program doesn't carry a setuid root
bit).

Furthermore, because the `starter-suid` program trusts the content of
the JSON config file found in the instance directory, an attacker can
modify this content to change the behaviour of the `starter-suid`
program when joining a container. This way all desired namespaces can be
configured or even the `noNewPrivileges` field can be set to false,
allowing a user to join the container without the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`
bit set (see `prctl()`).

Even further, during creation of a background instance, the unprivileged
user can try to win a race condition and place a symlink in path
`/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>/<instance>.json`. The
`starter-suid` program will follow this symlink and create and truncate
an existing file in the target location. This allows to create or
overwrite arbitrary files in the system with root privileges. The
content written to the file is only partially attacker controlled,
because the beginning of the JSON has a fixed structure.

I couldn't work out a full local root exploit from these defects yet but
all of the findings are very close to getting root and if putting in
enough energy there's probably some way to achieve it. Being able to
enter arbitary other namespaces is similar in consequences as
CVE-2018-12021 was for Singularity major version 2.

The issue has been fixed by usptream by moving the instance
configuration file into the user's home directory, fixing the
permissions of the directory in /run and not trusting certain parameters
found in the instance's JSON configuration.

PoC
===

For completeness here is a couple of lines that show a PoC for joining
arbitrary ipc, pid and mnt namespaces based on Singularity release
3.1.1:

```
user $ singularity pull library://library/default/debian
[...]
user $ singularity instance start library://library/default/debian deb
# this is the normal way of entering the container, becoming a member of
# the regular container namespaces
user $ singularity shell instance://deb
  deb-user $ ls -l /proc/$$/ns

  lrwxrwxrwx 1 user users 0 Apr 15 15:41 uts -> uts:[4026531838]
  deb-user $ exit

# now manipulate the state directory

user $ ln -s /proc/1/ns/mnt
user $ ln -s /proc/1/ns/ipc
# oberserve the changed values for pid, mnt and ipc. Of course joining
# the root namespaces does not make much sense but it shows the
# principle of operation
user $ singularity shell instance://deb
  deb-user $ ls -l /proc/$$/ns
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 user users 0 15. Apr 15:43 cgroup -> 'cgroup:[4026531835]'

  lrwxrwxrwx 1 user users 0 15. Apr 15:43 uts -> 'uts:[4026531838]'
```

Timeline
========

2019-04-15: I reported the finding to security@...abs.io
2019-04-18: Sylabs confirmed the issue and discussed various patching
            approaches with me. The process described in [4] has been
            triggered.
2019-05-15: The agreed upon coordinated-release-date was reached and
            Sylabs published the fixed version.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
