Hash: SHA512

Package        : mosquitto
Version        : 1.3.4-2+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7655 CVE-2018-12550 CVE-2018-12551
                 CVE-2019-11779

```
Several issues have been found in mosquitto, a MQTT version 3.1/3.1.1
compatible message broker.
```

CVE-2017-7655

     A Null dereference vulnerability in the Mosquitto library could
     lead to crashes for those applications using the library.

CVE-2018-12550

     An ACL file with no statements was treated as having a default
     allow policy. The new behaviour of an empty ACL file is a default
     policy of access denied.
     (this is in compliance with all newer releases)

CVE-2018-12551

     Malformed authentication data in the password file could allow
     clients to circumvent authentication and get access to the broker.

CVE-2019-11779

     Fix for processing a crafted SUBSCRIBE packet containing a topic
     that consists of approximately 65400 or more '/' characters.
     (setting TOPIC_HIERARCHY_LIMIT to 200)

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.4-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=541870#c0)  Yan Jia [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-12-03 19:30:32 EST  ``` This may accur when developers want to revoke the permission of a client. If the client is the last one in the ACL config file, it will be granted all permissions. For example:  1. A developer runs mosquitto: mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf And the acl_file contains:     topic readwrite a/a This means that the clients can only access the topic "a/a"  2. To revoke the permission of clients, the developer adds a "#" at the first of that line.  3. However, the clients are granted all permissions, which is against the will of developers. Because the acl_file is empty. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=541870#c1)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-01-23 18:39:02 EST  ``` Could I have a CVE assigned for this please, I'll provide the CVSS and description later. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=541870#c2)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-01-30 10:52:02 EST  ``` Description:  If Mosquitto is configured to use an ACL file, and that ACL file is empty, or contains only comments or blank lines, then Mosquitto will treat this as though no ACL file has been defined and use a default allow policy. The new behaviour is to have an empty ACL file mean that all access is denied, which is not a useful configuration but is not unexpected.  Affects versions 1.0 to 1.5.5 inclusive.  CVSS v2: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator?vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:N/E:ND/RL:OF/RC:C>)  CVSS v3: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=541870#c3)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-02-05 10:29:06 EST  ``` <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/440.html> ``` |  |
