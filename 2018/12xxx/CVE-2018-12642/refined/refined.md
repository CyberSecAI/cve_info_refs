Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-12642:

**Verification:**

The commit message "deny access to tickets not owned by current user, thx to chbi" and the code changes in `customer_tickets.php` suggest this commit addresses an access control issue related to tickets. This aligns with the general description of CVE-2018-12642, which states it's related to "Insufficient access control in Froxlor before 0.9.39 allows a user to view and modify tickets they don't own."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper access control checks when accessing or modifying tickets.  Before this fix, users could potentially access and manipulate tickets not associated with their accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness was that the application did not verify if a user had the rights to access or modify specific tickets. This allowed users to perform actions on tickets that belonged to other users.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** It seems like the application was likely using a direct object reference approach, where a ticket ID was used directly in the URL or POST request to access or modify the specific ticket. This made it easier for attackers to try to manipulate ticket IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could access sensitive information contained within tickets not belonging to them.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** An attacker could modify ticket details, statuses, or replies on tickets they did not own. This could result in data corruption or denial of service.
*   **Potential for escalation:** In some cases, this type of access control issue can lead to more serious exploits, such as complete account takeover depending on other application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation of Ticket IDs:** An attacker could intercept HTTP requests, change the ticket ID in a request, and submit it, attempting to access or modify different tickets.
*   **Brute Forcing Ticket IDs:** An attacker could try to iterate over ticket IDs to discover tickets belonging to other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Logic:** The attacker would need knowledge of how ticket IDs are used and how requests are handled by the application.

**Technical Details from the Diff:**

The commit diff shows modifications in `customer_tickets.php`, specifically within the 'answer', 'close', and 'reopen' actions. The code changes are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks when creating a `ticket` object via `ticket::getInstanceOf()`. This suggests that the fix involves checking the user's permission and potentially throwing an exception if they lack access. The original code was directly creating ticket objects and setting/updating information using the ticket ID provided in the URL/form without validating if the currently logged in user is the owner of the ticket. This code now seems to be correctly creating the `ticket` object and checking if the user has the right to access that ticket, likely within the `ticket::getInstanceOf()` method. The changes in `lib/classes/ticket/class.ticket.php` where not fully present in the diff.

**Summary of Changes:**

The changes in `customer_tickets.php` address the access control problem by ensuring that the code validates if the currently authenticated user has the right to interact with the specific ticket they are trying to access. The specific changes in `class.ticket.php` are not fully visible in the provided diff, however, it is likely where the permission check for the current user is being made. This prevents users from accessing/modifying data they don't own.
