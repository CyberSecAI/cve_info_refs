Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-12463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the `/ssc/fm-ws/services` endpoint of Fortify Software Security Center (SSC). This occurs because the application's XML parser is weakly configured and processes external entities defined in the XML input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the improper handling of external entities in XML input. This allows an attacker to control the XML input and include references to external entities (defined via DTD).
- **Out-of-Band (OOB) XXE:** The vulnerability is an out-of-band XXE, meaning the attacker can retrieve information from the server out-of-band (e.g. via HTTP or FTP).
- **Insecure XML Parsing:** The application's XML parser is not properly configured to prevent the processing of external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by referencing them in the external entity definition.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can cause the server to make requests to internal or external systems by defining malicious URLs in the DTD, leading to potential information disclosure or further attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly detailed, XXE can potentially cause denial of service through resource exhaustion if the external entity attempts to retrieve very large files.
- **Port Scanning:** The attacker can use the vulnerable server to perform port scans against internal hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/ssc/fm-ws/services` endpoint.
- **Malicious XML Payload:** The attacker injects a malicious XML payload containing a crafted Document Type Definition (DTD) that defines an external entity. The external entity points to a resource the attacker controls. This allows the attacker to force the server to either transmit the content of local files, or make a request to an external system the attacker controls.
- **Various Protocols:** The provided exploits show usage of HTTP and FTP protocols to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Fortify SSC server.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users. No prior knowledge of valid credentials is required.
- **Ability to Craft XML:** The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious XML payload containing the external entity definition within a valid SOAP message.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was found in Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) versions 17.10, 17.20, and 18.10.
- The exploit can be used to obtain sensitive information from the server or to make the server connect to external systems.
- The vendor (Micro Focus, now OpenText) has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is referenced by CVE-2018-12463, EDB-ID 45027.
