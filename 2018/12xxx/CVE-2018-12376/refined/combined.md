Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary

Package        : firefox-esr
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-12376 CVE-2018-12377 CVE-2018-12378

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 52.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Firefox has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/60.0esr/releasenotes/>

In addition, the new Firefox packages require Rust to build. A
compatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is
not available for all architectures which previously supported the
purely C++-based Firefox packages. Thus, the new Firefox packages
don't support the armel, armhf, mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures
at this point.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 60.2.0esr-1~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

For the detailed security status of firefox-esr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firefox-esr>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86\_64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0
Build ID: 20180704192850
Steps to reproduce:
In my existing firefox 61.0.4 (Ubuntu), I added a master password to protect my passwords.
Next, I used dumpzilla (<https://github.com/Busindre/dumpzilla>) to extract the passwords from my closed firefox browser.
Actual results:
All my passwords got decrypted without asking for my master password.
I'm assuming protection happens on UI level but not on data level.
Expected results:
I would expect a master password to encrypt the json file using the master password so it can't be opened without knowledge of that master password.

Did you restart Firefox? How old is the user profile?
FWIW, <https://github.com/Busindre/dumpzilla/blob/master/dumpzilla.py#L415-L427> has decryption code that specifically requests a master password, so no, the master password is not just a UI level protection.
It's possible there were old files in the profile you tested with (we moved password storage to a JSON file from a sqlite one) that the tool was able to use to recover passwords. Can you check if the profile folder (go to about:support in Firefox, then click the button to open the folder next to "Profile folder") if it has a signons.sqlite file?
I guess the other possibility is that we don't immediately re-encrypt files, or that if you kept Firefox open, the new state wasn't yet flushed to disk to overwrite the old one - I'm not familiar enough with our pw manager implementation myself to know for sure. Maybe Matt can add detail about how that's supposed to work.Component: Untriaged → Password ManagerFlags: needinfo?(jurgen)Flags: needinfo?(MattN+bmo)Product: Firefox → Toolkit

Hi,
thanks for the feedback - glad to be wrong (I was surprised that I didn't find the files encrypted)
So after rebooting, the passwords and usernames are encrypted in the json file.

... and after opening my browser, I could extract my passwords again without entering my password to dumpzilla (I could even access it with another account using a different tty login).
When trying to recreate the bug with a new profile, it didn't work and it asked the master password as expected.
On my existing (incrementally upgraded for over multiple years) account, no master password is needed and I see my passwords in plain text.
I have not found the signons.sqlite file in my profile folder.Status: RESOLVED → UNCONFIRMEDResolution: INVALID → ---

Jurgen, thanks for the quick updates. I'm not sure I follow completely at this point. Can you confirm that you're seeing the following:
- on your regular profile, with Firefox running, dumpzilla gets the passwords without prompting you for a password (presumably at this point you've given Firefox your master password when it started?)
- on that same profile, once you close Firefox, dumpzilla can't get passwords (or maybe it can, but it can't anymore after a reboot? Please clarify. :-) )
- on a new profile, where you save a password "behind" a master password, dumpzilla can't get the passwords either when Firefox is running or when it isn't - at this point, when testing what happens when Firefox is running, have you given Firefox the master password for that new profile?
(Basically, my current hypothesis is that while Firefox is running \*and\* you've already given it your master password, the NSS library which dumpzilla relies on directly (exact paths are stored in the python file) knows the master password (presumably stores it in memory?) and can thus decrypt your passwords without asking you for the master password. But I can't quite tell from your description if that holds up or not.)Flags: needinfo?(jurgen)

So I have 2 users:
1. jurgen (my old ye faithful account that has been passed on since Ubuntu 12.04 and FF3 or so)
2. test (newly created for this test)
both are in the sudo'ers group.
This is after a fresh reboot.
Step 1: just work as jurgen (with master password). I have closed FF. On tty2 log in with test - sudo su. Now run dumpzilla on the profile under jurgen. I gain access to all passwords without entering master password.
Step 2: work as test (first login, so completely virgin account) - I created an account on Wikipedia and stored my username and password. Now I went to settings and added a master password. Log in to tty2 with jurgen - sudo su. Now run dumpzilla on the profile under test. Access to passwords failed.
I'd like to supply with screenshots or recording, but it's a bit hard. Don't know how to record TTY2.Flags: needinfo?(jurgen)

OK. I don't really know what's going on then, and it's a bit hard for me to try to reproduce - in part because you yourself can't reproduce on a clean profile and we don't know what's different about your main profile, and in part because the tool doesn't seem to work well on macOS. Mind you, the output is confusing anyway, because it says:
[ERROR] Error decoding passwords: libnss not found (/Applications/Firefox\ Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/libnss3.dylib)
(I altered the path to be correct because plain `libnss3.dylib` also didn't work, but this didn't make any difference)
and yet it also says:
===============================================================================================================
== Total Information
==============================================================================================================
Total Decode Passwords : 1
Total Passwords : 1
even though the output does not in fact contain my (fake) saved password. I assume:
User field: identifier
Password field: password
would normally contain the actual password and username, or something?
Hopefully MattN has more ideas.

> I have not found the signons.sqlite file in my profile folder.
Can you please double/triple check this? Note that basename of the files is different signons vs. logins. Make absolutely sure you're looking at the correct profile folder, the same one as dumpzilla is.
The issue may actually be about key3.db vs. key4.db… When did you setup a Master Password in your default profile? If you move key3.db out of the profile folder can dumpzilla still decrypt the logins?Flags: needinfo?(MattN+bmo) → needinfo?(jurgen)

When I move key3.db out of the profile, it indeed can't access the passwords anymore and asks for a master password.

OK, so I think the issue is that you setup a master password after the conversion to key4.db (looks like it was Firefox 58?) and we haven't yet cleaned up key3.db files. This bug could track that cleanup if that's the case.
David, does that make sense? My understanding is that having an old key\*.db without a master password would be enough to decrypt logins since we don't re-encrypt the saved data when a MP is enabled or disabled.Blocks: [783994](/show_bug.cgi?id=783994 "RESOLVED FIXED - switch Mozilla to use the cert9+key4 (aka sql) database file format")Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

Yes - if a user adds a master password after upgrading to 58, their logins will still be decryptable as long as key3.db exists. We can probably clean up those old files at this point (key3.db, cert8.db, and secmod.db).Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

NSS performs the migration internally. We could probably add code to NSS to delete the old DBs as part of migration, but that wouldn't help anyone who has already migrated.

OK. At what point in browser startup is the migration performed? We can add a migration step to nsBrowserGlue, but we don't normally use it for this type of thing, and if it races with the migration then the obvious result would be dataloss... :-(Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

It would be great if we had [bug 1455707](/show_bug.cgi?id=1455707 "RESOLVED FIXED - Warn when starting a profile that last ran with a newer build") implemented before we delete the old files. Usually we leave the old files around for a while to support downgrades.
I think we should do the following:
a) Delete key3.db (if it exists) when a master password is changed/enabled. That solves this bug and should be backported to ESR.
b) Delete all of the old files (key3.db, cert8.db, and secmod.db) for the next ESR (to support downgrades between ESR) in an upcoming release… I don't think we need to rush on this. Should we only do this for Firefox (e.g. migrateUI) or do we another another place to do this that won't incur a startup perf hit from file I/O every startup? Or does this need to be in PSM for all PSM consumers? We should at least notify downstream consumers about this issue I guess? This affects who should implement it.

I think it would be safest to only backport a fix to delete key3.db if a master password is changed/enabled. This won't help ESR users who already make a MP change after ESR60 got installed but since that is still very new we probably have time to fix this before may people are affected since less than 1% of users use a MP.

It happens when we call NSS\_Initialize [0] as part of initializing nsINSSComponent (nsNSSComponent [1]).
[0] <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6f86cc3479f80ace97f62634e2c82a483d1ede40/security/certverifier/NSSCertDBTrustDomain.cpp#1147>

For better or worse, currently it's synchronous, so if you first instantiate the service (and it successfully initializes NSS in read/write mode, which isn't guaranteed...) then you won't race.

This seems reasonable (although there's the issue of if a user switches back to an older ESR, things like saved passwords and imported certificates might not work).

I mean, we're already accessing all of these files synchronously at startup anyway right now (see [bug 1370516](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370516 "NEW - NSS should be initialized off main thread")), so it probably won't be that much more of a performance hit.
We should at least mention this to the NSS team. Their stance may be "yes, definitely the old DBs should be deleted" or it may be "no, we can't risk the loss of user data". That said, I think Firefox may need/want to make a different decision than NSS does on this.

I think doing both a and b sounds good. There is already some code in nsNSSComponent that does a similar thing [2], so maybe it makes sense to put both there.

So the work-around for people like me, would be to manually delete key3.db if I want to prioritize security over backward compatibility. That's right?
Would it be a sensible approach to put this decision in a GUI?
[x] Maintain backward compatibilty (decreasing security)
[ ] Increase security (breaks compatibility with FF older than XXX)
This way, the option is left to the user? (ideally, these options only appear in the master password dialog box)

We could but IMO that would be too much work (initial and maintenance) for a feature that less than 1% of users use.

Too bad... well, I guess people being critical about safety use something external like keepass and the ones not critical about it... well, they just prefer the ease of it.
Anyways, thanks for implementing it.
I'd like to set out a little blog post on this topic and the workaround. Seeing the timeline, I'm assuming that's okay to do that soonish?

Please wait until the bug has been fixed on the release channel so that users are no longer affected. At that point I'm not sure it would be useful to blog about… it would only help ESR users who changed/enabled a MP since ESR60.
Moving this to PSM since that's where the original bug was and it sounds like this will get fixed in security code, not Toolkit.

Yeah, though I think if a user is changing or setting a MP then they would prefer their data was no longer accessible without a MP.

[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 783994](/show_bug.cgi?id=783994 "RESOLVED FIXED - switch Mozilla to use the cert9+key4 (aka sql) database file format")
[User impact if declined]: If a user has saved passwords but hadn't set a master password before upgrading to Firefox 58, and then subsequently sets a master password, it is possible to recover the user's saved passwords without knowing their master password. This is probably fairly rare, though - the vast majority (99%) of users don't set a master password ever.

[Is the change risky?]: not very
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: the fix we went with was to check for and remove the old key database if the user has a master password set. Since most users don't have a password, this is a no-op for most users.

We can't delete comments on bugzilla, but we can mark them private (meaning they'll only be visible to people who have security clearance on bugzilla). I'll do this pre-emptively now so it doesn't get forgotten.

IIUC, that would be doing what this bug did but on ESR60. IMO this should have been considered for esr60 but RyanVM marked it as wontfix in [comment 33](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c33 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)") but I'm not sure what the rationale was. I don't think we need a new bug… we can request uplift here.

Given the relative ease of resolution and the impact for people affected (it is really REALLY simple to get those passwords) - I thought especially in an ESR, which people tend to use on security centric distros like Kali Linux and Parrot OS ... this feels like a critical feature (especially since the implementation of the crypto is really solid) to end up being cheated about.
The only reason for the low CVE rating, is the judgement call that the MP is a rarely used feature. This kind of behavior will consolidate people into not using it (as it appears to be not reliable). So if you yourself believe that using the MP is a good thing, you should agree that it being rock solid is not a detail.
Not sure as how or where to nominate the patch, but I really want to make a case here. Otherwise you could as well just leave out that feature (since only less than 1% of the users use it) and recommend people use an external password manager.

How so? People would need local system access and to be logged into the account in question. This is not a drive by web exploit that can be done by a malicious site. This requires malware or your local account to be hacked by someone.

Are those people likely to have a third party access their system or have a vulnerability that gives local file access to their accounts? Your example is security centric distros so this seems unlikely.
As a general rule, we don't backport sec-low rated issues to ESR branches. Ryan's point is that if you or someone makes a patch that applies cleanly to ESR60 and nominates the patch for acceptance, he's willing to listen to an argument to apply it.

We shouldn't just consider this for nomination from the security perspective but also take into account that it's a form of regression that the Master Password can be bypassed so easily.

[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: this is a pretty easy way for users to think they've encrypted their passwords when in fact there's a plain-text copy of the encryption key sitting in their profile directory, which is not a great situation. We've already had one duplicate filed on this.
User impact if declined: users may be surprised to find that their passwords can be decrypted when they thought they had password-protected them.
Fix Landed on Version: 63, uplifted to 62
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): fairly low - it seems to be working without issue so far
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none

It appears that this fix caused data loss for one of my users. User is on CentOS 7, and was upgraded from 60.2.0 ESR to 60.2.1 ESR on Sep 29. She has a very old profile dir, has a master password set, and reports having last changed the master password 5-6 years ago. After the update to 60.2.1 ESR, the next time she opened Firefox, she noted that it no longer prompted her for her master password, the "Use a master password" option in Preferences was no longer checked, and all of her saved logins are gone. Instead there is now just a single entry for Site: chrome://FirefoxAccounts (Firefox Accounts credentials), with a long hexadecimal username, and Password: {"version":1,"accountData":{}}.
We do have backups of her home directory from before the upgrade, which we could restore data from, but I am unclear on how to proceed in this case. If I simply replace her ~/.mozilla with the older copy and relaunch Firefox, on the first run her MP is back and her saved logins are present, but after closing and restarting Firefox they're gone again. Using the old ~/.mozilla but manually deleting key3.db before launching Firefox again results in no MP and no saved logins.
FWIW, all of the following files were present in her profile directory prior to the upgrade:
# ls -l key3.db secmod.db cert8.db signons.sqlite logins.json
-rw-------. 1 500 500 688128 Sep 4 08:23 cert8.db
-rw-------. 1 500 500 16384 Sep 4 08:23 key3.db
-rw-------. 1 500 500 82886 Sep 26 11:01 logins.json
-rw-------. 1 500 500 16384 Oct 12 2014 secmod.db
-rw-r--r--. 1 500 500 327680 May 11 2015 signons.sqlite
From this and reading the thread above, my interpretation is that her saved logins were successfully migrated from signons.sqlite to logins.json at some point in the past (2015?), but her MP was still saved in an old format (key3.db? secmod.db?) and never migrated to the new format. Does that interpretation sound correct? Given this scenario, how can I go about restoring this user's saved login data, and/or converting her MP to the new format?

Given a directory "dir" containing cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db (and not cert9.db, key4.db, or pkcs11.txt), try running:
certutil -K -X -d dir
You should be asked for the password for that database. (It might say "no keys found", but you can ignore that.)
If that succeeds, cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt should have been created in that directory. Move those to the Firefox profile and remove the old cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db files from the Firefox profile. (This is assuming your version of NSS is recent enough - from <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.35_release_notes> I think 3.35 should be sufficient).Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler) → needinfo?(paulds)

That certutil command does prompt for the password, and does say "no keys found", but it does not create any of the files you indicated. I've looked at the man page for certutil, and it's not clear to me why those options would convert anything or create new files; can you confirm this was the syntax you intended?
laptop:~/.mozilla/firefox/loejs653.default$ ls cert\*db key\* secmod.db pkcs11.txt
ls: cannot access pkcs11.txt: No such file or directory
cert8.db key3.db secmod.db
laptop:~/.mozilla/firefox/loejs653.default$ cd ..
laptop:~/.mozilla/firefox$ certutil -K -X -d loejs653.default/
certutil: Checking token "NSS Certificate DB" in slot "NSS User Private Key and Certificate Services"
Enter Password or Pin for "NSS Certificate DB":
certutil: no keys found
laptop:~/.mozilla/firefox$ cd loejs653.default/
laptop:~/.mozilla/firefox/loejs653.default$ ls cert\*db key\* secmod.db pkcs11.txt
ls: cannot access pkcs11.txt: No such file or directory
cert8.db key3.db secmod.db
FWIW, this is with nss-tools-3.36.0-7.el7\_5.Flags: needinfo?(paulds) → needinfo?(dkeeler)

Yes, that's the intended syntax. Newer versions of NSS \*should\* automatically upgrade the old dbm databases to sqlite when they're opened read/write (which is what -X should do). Maybe try with a newer version of NSS? (I'm using nss-3.39.0-1.0.fc28)Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

On EL7 in order to get NSS/certutil to create the new sql databases you need to do:
export NSS\_DEFAULT\_DB\_TYPE=sql
but I still haven't figured out how to migrate a pre 60.2.1 profile - though I may be working with a bad initial profile.

I am in the same situation as [Comment 51](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c51 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)") ; I have tried the solution suggested in [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c53 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)") using export NSS\_DEFAULT\_DB\_TYPE=sql suggested in [comment 55](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c55 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)"). That created the files expected.I copied the new files: key4.db pkcs11.txt cert9.db into place and deleted the old ones key3.db secmod.db cert8.db. On start up that worked but (after trial and error)
I found that firefox is creating key3.db cert8.db and secmod.db files when I add a new entry to the password manager and exit. Then I have to delete the newly created key3.db cert8.db and secmod.db files to get things to work.

Turns out the trigger to make it work after following the instructions is to have the env variable NSS\_DEFAULT\_DB\_TYPE=sql set before exucuting firefox .If it is not set it keeps recreating key3.db cert8.db and secmod.db files . Adding a new entry to the password manager has nothing to do with it.

Confirming that setting NSS\_DEFAULT\_DB\_TYPE=sql before running certutil seems to have worked. New files were generated; removed old files. Based on Phil's notes in [comment 56](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c56 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)") and [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775#c57 "RESOLVED FIXED - key3.db encryption key remains on disk from pre-Firefox-58 (becomes issue if adding a master password post-58)") above, also added "export NSS\_DEFAULT\_DB\_TYPE=sql" to user's .bash\_profile and had her log in again. Running firefox now preserves the MP, saved logins remain accessible, and the old versions of the files are not recreated.

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3458)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted for the update to take effect.

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12376: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2](#CVE-2018-12376)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-3793-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

15 October 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12376](/security/CVE-2018-12376), [CVE-2018-12377](/security/CVE-2018-12377),

[CVE-2018-12378](/security/CVE-2018-12378))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 58 and

then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12383](/security/CVE-2018-12383))

A crash was discovered in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL, which could

be triggered by data stored in the local cache directory. An attacker

could potentially exploit this in combination with another vulnerability

that allowed them to write data to the cache, to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-12385](/security/CVE-2018-12385))

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-11-08 09:55:55 UTC  ``` Tor Browser before 7.0.9 on macOS and Linux allows remote attackers to bypass the intended anonymity feature and discover a client IP address via vectors involving a crafted web site that leverages file:// mishandling in Firefox, aka TorMoil.  Upstream issue:  <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24052>  References:  <https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-709-released> <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tormoil-vulnerability-leaks-real-ip-address-from-tor-browser-users/> <https://www.wearesegment.com/research/tormoil-torbrowser-unspecified-critical-security-vulnerability/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-11-08 09:56:21 UTC  ``` Created tor tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1510817](show_bug.cgi?id=1510817 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-16541 tor: Anonymity feature bypass via crafted web site [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1510818](show_bug.cgi?id=1510818 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2017-16541 tor: Anonymity feature bypass via crafted web site [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-06 01:41:26 UTC  ``` This was found to be a bug in Firefox ESR, fixed in 60.2:  Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.  *Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*  External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-21/#CVE-2017-16541>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:55:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2692 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2692](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2692)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:57:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:2693 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2693](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2693)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1510816#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-10-09 01:58:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw cannot be exploited through email in Thunderbird as scripting is disabled in this for email content.

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3403)

## 标题

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## 解决方案

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted for the update to take effect.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12381: Dragging and dropping Outlook email message results in page navigation](#CVE-2018-12381)

Reporter
Jana Squires
Impact
low
##### Description

Manually dragging and dropping an Outlook email message into the browser will trigger a page navigation when the message's mail columns are incorrectly interpreted as a URL.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems with Outlook installed. Other operating systems are not affected.*

* [Bug 1435319](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319)

#### [#CVE-2018-12382: Addressbar spoofing with javascript URI on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12382)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.
*This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.*

* [Bug 1479311](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1479311)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Signature:

*None*

## Security

### (public)

This bug is publicly visible.

## User Story

```
There are two problems here:

1) dropping an email from the Outlook application on Windows gets interpreted as a URL of the outlook mail columns

2) fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com is a malicious site taking advantage of this and needs to get blocked.

Getting SafeBrowsing to block the site would mitigate this particular instance, but we're not having much success there. Besides there might be other apps (or a localized Outlook?) that result in different text that gets Firefox to open a different domain that bad people will then domain-squat on in a similar way.
```

[Malicious site with Freifox.jpg](attachment.cgi?id=8947914)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8947914&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.132 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Outlook 2016 on a Windows device
2. Drag an email from Outlook, and drop it in a Firefox tab
Actual results:
1. Firefox then redirects to <http://www.fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com/>
2. That site in turns redirects to various malicious sites - an example is attached
3. The behaviour continues despite disabling the inline auto-complete option. See <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Inline_autocomplete>
Note that the first site is a combination of the column headers in Outlook.
Also note that I'm unable to reproduce this behaviour with Chrome or IE on Windows, or with Chrome, Firefox and Safari on Mac OSX.
Tested with only Firefox version 57.0.4
Expected results:
Firefox should not auto-complete the drag and drop from Outlook.

Can't open your image, there are errors in it (at least on my system -- maybe it's a variant .jpg format?)
The autocomplete option (if it still works -- that's an old article) would only apply to typing in a URL. Drag and drop is a different mechanism. There's no autocomplete, you're dropping the actual content. If the content you drop is a link to a web page we'll open that page. That page can then do whatever a web page can do that you've browsed to on the web or opened by clicking on a link elsewhere. Redirecting is one of those things.
We can report malicious sites to the SafeBrowsing service, so they get blocked. Otherwise I'm not sure what else here is a Firefox security bug.Flags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

Hi Daniel,
Thanks for your feedback.
To clarify: This behaviour is reproduced with any email that's dragged from Outlook, and into a tab in Firefox.
The site that Firefox tries to navigate to is fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories[.]com/. This is based on the default column headings within Outlook.
I've been able to reproduce the behaviour today using Outlook 2016 (Windows) and Firefox 58.01 (Windows).
I drag any email onto a page of a Firefox tab, an invalid page loads using then drag and drop mechanism, then navigation to the malicious site begins in a second tab. Note it doesn't matter which email I use, the navigation to the aforementioned site is the same.
Are you able to test the behaviour as well?
Regards,
- JanaFlags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

Francois: do we have any mechanism to block sites when tracking protection is OFF (the default)? I believe Firefox is correctly interpreting the outlook content, but some scammer has obtained this domain that must be a default embedded in the format.

Yes, we have the plugin blocklist: <https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-plugin-blocklist/blob/master/mozplugin-block.txt>

I reported this site to the safebrowsing people and it's still not blocked. Can we add it to our own list? This site does nothing good. At best you end up on Amazon with a referral link so these jerks make money.

Someone has gamed Google's system: "No unsafe content found". There's nothing there except a navigation to various \_other\_ sites that are unsafe or deceptive, but the bad stuff isn't on that site so it gets a pass?

Thanks all for investigating this.
Just want a reminder that during my tests I wasn't able to replicate this on Chrome or IE - only on Firefox.
Admittedly I didn't test it with any other browsers. However it does relate to the way Firefox handles drag and drops into tabs. Is there a way to disable that process in the configuration?

There are two problems here:
1) dropping an email from the Outlook application on Windows gets interpreted as a URL of the outlook mail columns. Why are we trying to interpret mail as anything? It's possible Outlook is tagging their drag content incorrectly, but other browsers seem to have made allowances for that if that's the case.
2) fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com is a malicious site taking advantage of this and needs to get blocked.
Getting SafeBrowsing to block the site would mitigate this particular instance, but we're not having much success there so we should look into #1. Besides there might be other apps (or a localized Outlook?) that result in different text that gets Firefox to open a different domain that bad people will then domain-squat on in a similar way.Group: firefox-core-security → dom-core-securityUser Story: (updated)Component: Security → Drag and DropFlags: needinfo?(haftandilian)OS: Unspecified → WindowsProduct: Firefox → Core

unfortunately I don't have outlook 2016 right now.
can anyone perform the following operation to tell me what kind of data is dropped?
1. open the attached file in Firefox 60.0.2, or newer, (or maybe on 58.0.1 if there's any different behavior)
(the file listens to the drop event and shows dropped item's data)
2. drag and drop an email from outlook 2016 to "Drag and drop items here." text in the page
3. copy and paste the whole displayed text into a new text file
4. upload the text file here

If the dropped item doesn't contain "text/uri-list" or "text/moz-list" flavor, but "text/plain" flavor, Firefox tries to interpret every line in the text as URI.
while intepreting, it performs fixup (just like when some word is entered in the location bar),
and it can make some possibly-non-URI to URI (which might explain the long domain).
[bug 1435910](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging multiple lines of text to the tab bar creates multiple tabs") changed this behavior a bit in Firefox 60, and now if there's any absolutely-non-URI line, entire text is treated as a single search term, so it won't open any URI interpreted from the text.
So, the behavior could be different between Firefox 58.0.1 and 60.0.2, and might already be \*fixed\* now.
but anyway I'd like to confirm how this happened, in term of the dropped text content, so the result for the [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging an email from Outlook into a Firefox tab redirects to malicious site") is welcome.

Did you ever check with Marshall on policy/legal aspects of adding this to the plugin blocklist? I nearly got caught out by this but luckily for me the corporate web content filtering saved me. Others aren't won't have such protections and I'm surprised issue has been hanging around for 4 months despite this being actively exploited. While it might not be the most elegant solution, adding the URL to the plugin blocklist may well mitigate the vulnerability for the vast majority of people.

Thank you for checking!
So, apparently those words are separated with TAB character, which is somehow removed while fixing up.
(so, it's considered to be an URI inside ContentAreaDropListener.prototype.\_addLinksFromItem, and actually fixed up while opening it)
let flags = Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_FIX\_SCHEME\_TYPOS |
Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_ALLOW\_KEYWORD\_LOOKUP;
let info = Services.uriFixup.getFixupURIInfo("From\tSubject", flags);
console.log(info.fixedURI.spec);
I'll look into the Services.uriFixup implementation.
(IMO, TAB should be treated in the same way as SPACE, which isn't get removed)
then, I misremembered about the current behavior:

This is essentially a result of the URL specification, not fixup - `new URL("<http://foo\tbar>")` produces a URL object instead of null.
I guess when we prefix `http` ( inside <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/75a32b57132f8cba42779555662a057a0416a313/docshell/base/nsDefaultURIFixup.cpp#366> ) then we could in principle check if there are tab characters in the input and bail out if so. That seems hacky though, also because they could be in the query string or similar (rather than the hostname) where the current behavior is probably correct.
(FWIW, this probably wants moving back to a frontend component, or maybe Core :: Document Navigation if we think we should indeed fix this inside the URI fixup code, which in any case should probably be moved to toolkit at some point...)

I think that we should probably address this in nsDefaultURIFixup, although it's not easy.
Some strings like domain.tld resemble a URL a bit, so it's OK to fix them up, but From\tSubject really doesn't, so we should be a bit more strict in this regard. "Does it look like a URL" is more difficult for computers than humans, but I think we can do better.
Indeed, the URL code strips some whitespace characters, but that flexibility is mostly to improve webcompat and to make things easier for developers. When we get weird stuff from other sources, we should try to avoid surprises.

[Don't fix up protocols for tab-separated content](attachment.cgi?id=8985175&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8985175&action=edit)

I'm not really convinced by this approach, but I assume it fixes the issue here.
I actually think that fixing up by ignoring tabs is probably the user-friendly thing to do in general. The combination with dnd to the result that we get here is unfortunate, but fixing only the dnd consumer would feel wrong because it would leave other issues with e.g. copy/paste (or "Paste and Go").

I... continue to find this very strange. Anyway, this is not the best place to have that particular discussion.
> When we get weird stuff from other sources, we should try to avoid surprises.
I mean, we do the inverse (but also wrong) thing in e.g. [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1460097](/show_bug.cgi?id=1460097 "VERIFIED FIXED - Hidden character in pasted url gets wrongly interpreted") in that we don't remove enough whitespace when humans try to load content. Fixup is \*meant\* to take things that are barely URLs and make them into URLs. That's part of why I'm conflicted (see [comment #24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging an email from Outlook into a Firefox tab redirects to malicious site") - fwiw, I hadn't seen your comment when I wrote/posted the patch...)

Don't fix up protocols for tab-separated content

Thanks!
So, this solves the case that there are at least 3 columns (so there are 2 TABs between them) in the mail listing,
which would match default case and most usecases, I think?
if there's no existing testcase that fails with this change (so, no known case that we should handle otherwise), I think this is reasonable fix for this bug.
the another solution would be, do not add prefix/suffix if there's at least one whitespaces in between non-whitespace characters of given text.
the possible case I can think of which there's whitespaces inside the input URL is, when the URL is copied from somewhere else that wrapped the URL with extra whitespaces. so at least suffix should already be there (let me know if there's another case).
this bug's case is troublesome because we add ".com" to non-hostname thing.
we could be more careful/strict when to treat the given text as possible partial hostname.

I guess it's better adding a static function with descriptive name (like, MaybeTabSeparatedValues, or something like that?),
also, it should be better handling leading/trailing TABs as well.
currently leading/trailing SPACEs are removed here, but TABs are kept:

if there are only multiple leading/trailing TABs in the given text (like, "\t\tmozilla.com\t\t\t", it's now treated as non-URL.
So, this should test that there are at least 1 TAB sequence in the middle of non-TAB text.

I don't want anything to happen per se. Instead, it was merely an observation stumbled upon when attempting to add attach an email to a Jira ticket. Instead of dropping it in the ticket, it was dropped in the tab area; which then created a connection to the malicious url.Flags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

For links in web pages, the reason we have to deal with tabs is stuff like this:
<a href="<http://foo.bar.com/foo/>
baz.html">Stuff</a>
Where the indent after the linebreak includes tabs.
It's not clear what should happen if we get a string like that sent to us from an external app...

Valentin, bz is out, could you review this?
Dan, can you add a rating? For me the redirects point to a page that heavily suggests downloading some malware - but doesn't do anything to keep you there / stop you closing the tab. So I don't think this is severe enough to warrant sec-high/sec-crit and therefore sec-approval, but if you disagree I can fill out the form... :-)

Not sure if we want to land this separately, but just in case, separate patch for the tests.
I got a bit frustrated with the xpcshell lack of messaging about deciphering what:
0:01.62 FAIL do\_single\_test\_run - [do\_single\_test\_run : 619] false == true
actually meant, so I added some more messages to the tests to make them easier to read. Even without that though, this is enough of a not-a-bullseye that I think we could probably land them at the same time. It's pretty hard to go from this patch (change how we handle \t in URI fixup) to "you should drag emails or other tab-separated content to places to land on malicious pages".

I used the malware one, and I might have also used the phishing one just in case I guessed wrong about how Google would categorize it.
I'm guessing sec-low for the rating because Firefox ought to be robust in the face of a malicious site since there's any number of ways users can stumble into one. But depending on what site comes up and what users /thought/ they were doing by dragging the mail our behavior might contribute to social engineering attacks.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)

Sounds reasonable to me. We have decent automated test coverage here, and this has been sitting on beta for a while now without (AFAIK) complaints.

If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: workaround-ish fix for issue with workflows that may be particularly prevalent on ESR

# USN-3761-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

6 September 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12375](/security/CVE-2018-12375), [CVE-2018-12376](/security/CVE-2018-12376), [CVE-2018-12377](/security/CVE-2018-12377),

[CVE-2018-12378](/security/CVE-2018-12378))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12383](/security/CVE-2018-12383))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.18.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.14.04.3)

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:14:26 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60 and Firefox ESR 60. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.   External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-21/#CVE-2018-12376>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:14:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mozilla project Upstream: Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:55:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2692 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2692](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2692)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-12 10:57:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:2693 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2693](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2693)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c7)  Doran Moppert    2018-10-09 01:58:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw cannot be exploited through email in Thunderbird as scripting is disabled in this for email content. It may be possible to exploit through Feeds (Atom or RSS) or other browser-like contexts.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 16:58:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:3403 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3403](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3403)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1625525#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 10:43:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3458 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3458](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3458)   ``` |  |
