Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12996:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2018-12996, which is described as a reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager. The content from github.com explicitly mentions CVE-2018-12996 along with a description of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. Similarly, the content from seclists.org provides the same PoC, and confirms the vulnerability with the same CVE number.

**2. Extracted Information:**

-   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization on the `method` parameter in the `GraphicalView.do` endpoint.
-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that user-supplied input is reflected back to the user within the webpage without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
-   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the user's browser session. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the web application
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
-   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the network. A remote attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the `method` parameter, and if a victim clicks this URL, the XSS attack will be executed within the context of the vulnerable application.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
    *   The attacker needs to lure the victim to access the malicious URL (e.g., through social engineering, malicious links, or compromised websites).
    *   No specific attacker privileges are needed.

**Additional details from the provided content (beyond CVE description):**

*   **Affected component**: The vulnerability exists in `GraphicalView.do` of Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager before build 13800.
*   **Patched version**: The vulnerability is patched in build 13800 and later of Zoho ManageEngine Applications Manager.
*  **Proof of Concept**:  `/GraphicalView.do?method=createBusinessService"scriptalert(5045)/script`
*  **Browser dependency:** The vulnerability can be successfully reproduced under IE.
*   **CVSS v3 Metrics**:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
