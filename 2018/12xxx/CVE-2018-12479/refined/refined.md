Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12479:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the Open Build Service (OBS) allowing users to create new requests with arbitrary request IDs through the `osc api -XPOST "/request/?cmd=create"` command. The server-side did not enforce the expected monotonically increasing request ID generation. Additionally, the client could also provide comment dates, leading to potential "faked" date issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Request ID Creation:** The system allows clients to specify the `id` attribute when creating requests, rather than the server auto-incrementing this. This leads to potential conflicts with the auto-generated IDs and manipulation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server does not validate or sanitize the provided request IDs, accepting negative or excessively large IDs.
*  **Comment date spoofing**: The server was not enforcing the comment date to be "now" on creation.
*   **Missing CSRF protection:** A CSRF token was missing on the request. This is a general vulnerability and not directly linked to the CVE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could create a request with an ID that matches the next auto-generated ID. This would break the auto-increment logic, resulting in a server error and preventing other users from creating new requests without explicitly specifying the id, which users should not be able to provide in the first place.
*   **Data Manipulation/Confusion:** By using ridiculously high or negative request IDs, an attacker can confuse users and potentially cause issues in systems relying on the sequential nature of request IDs.
*   **Comment manipulation:** Comment dates could be faked by the client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Calls:**  The vulnerability is triggered through the `osc api -XPOST "/request/?cmd=create"` API call, allowing an attacker to create requests with crafted XML payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to OBS API:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Open Build Service API to make the vulnerable request.
* **Ability to craft requests:** The attacker needs to be able to use the osc api to send crafted XML payloads to the server.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was identified during a general audit of the OBS system.
*   The fix involved moving the request ID validation from the model to the controller.
*   The server now rejects requests with an `id` attribute during creation, and ignores the `state` attribute if provided.
*   The fix was backported to version 2.9, highlighting the severity of the issue.
*   The fix includes a check to prevent users from setting the `state` for other users when creating a request.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-12479.
*   The fix was implemented in pull request #5880 and merged into the master branch.
