New requests should not include the `id` attribute. If a `<state>` element is provided it will be ignored.

Why does this happen in the model? There was good reason why Rails 4 moved mass assignment protection from the model to the controller.

> The whole point of the controller is to control the flow between user and application, including authentication, authorization, and as part of that access control.

So this should be the responsibility of the controller IMHO!

Just brain storming regarding your questions this morning:

1. You could make this function to accept both, string and xml hash (although not super nice)
2. It seems like xml gets always wrapped into an xml hash and stored in the params hash, so no need to parse it again (<https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/blob/master/src/api/config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb#L61>)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Ops. To use the `xmlhash` parameter seems the right approach. I wil try it.

Also not sure if you need to raise an exception or just silently ignore it? I think it is reasonable when you create a new request to just ignore the id, no?

And I really don't like that you always need to add the SaveError now because next person who will use this function will forget. Why not just leave it in the method?

Not yet. I will try.

When you say 'the method' I'm fine with adding the `raise SaveError` guard clause to the `Xmlhash.parse` method.

If you refer to add the `raise SaveError` guard clause to the `new_from_hash` method, how would you implement the check of the `id` element in the `request_create` method in `src/api/app/controllers/request_controller.rb`?

You can just slice it `@req = BsRequest.new_from_xml(parsed_xml.slice(:the, :keys, :you, :allow))`. Maybe this should even happen in a function like:

```
def xml_hash
  result = Xmlhash.parse(request.raw_post.to_s).with_indifferent_access
  result.slice(:the, :keys, :you, :allow)
end

```

Btw: does setting the state in update make sense? We have a dedicated action `changestate` so I would expect that this is not allowed?

The function name does not what it says anymore, it is more like `new_from_hash`, right?

| I have dropped the `state` change now. It's simply not defined what should happen. There are multiple tests on each side of this argument.  And it's also not related to validating that you don't set `id` while creating. Lets do this somewhere else. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1108435#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-14 09:33:23 UTC  ``` Splitting of this bug from the general audit [bug 1085033](show_bug.cgi?id=1085033 "IN_PROGRESS").  The call `osc api -XPOST "/request/?cmd=create" -T/tmp/request.xml` allows to create new requests with arbitary comments (as the calling user), and request ID. The date of the comments can be "faked" by the client. Furthermore very large or even negative request IDs can be specified in the XML via `<request id="$ID" ...>`. I guess most users will expect that the request IDs are strictly monotonically increasing and that this is enforced on the server side.  Turns out that this allows for a kind of DoS, when taking explicitly the the request ID that the server would choose next. Then the next automatically chosen request ID will be broken with an internal server error, because the implicitly chosen request ID is duplicate. The current global counter is kept in the `bs_request_counter` table. This allows to break request creation for all other users that don't explicitly specify request IDs. Entry in the production.log in this situation:  ``` Started POST "/request?cmd=create" for 10.160.66.223 at 2018-09-14 09:32:01 +0000 Processing by RequestController#global_command as XML   Parameters: {"cmd"=>"create"} Can't verify CSRF token authenticity.

I think they should never be negative, the server should always choose the next request ID for new requests. A single comment for new requests with the date chosen by the server to be "now" would also be prudent. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1108435#c1)  Adrian Schröter   2018-09-14 09:41:37 UTC  ``` POST /request?cmd=create  must indeed not allow to specify request ID. IMHO it should also not allow to add comments. A serious issue indeed, so we should fix and backport this to 2.9 (must be a regression IMHO).  The PUT /request/:id route must allow this however (maybe fail if it would cause a request ID gap). But this route is limited to OBS admins. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108435#c2)  Eduardo José Navarro Alvarado   2018-09-19 16:50:42 UTC  ``` This pull request was created to address the bug:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/pull/5880> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1108435#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-26 11:39:01 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2018-12479 for this issue ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1108435#c4)  Hendrik Vogelsang   2018-10-09 13:41:21 UTC  ``` Alright the release is out.
