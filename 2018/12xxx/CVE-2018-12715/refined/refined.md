{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DIGISOL DG-HR3400 Wireless Router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the SSID field within the 'Basic Settings' of the wireless configuration.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface. When a user views the affected page, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This can potentially lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as session hijacking, credential theft, redirection to malicious websites, or the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the router. An attacker needs to access the router's settings page, specifically 'General Setup' -> 'Wireless' -> 'Basic Settings', and then modify the SSID field to inject the malicious script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface, which usually requires being on the same network as the router or having remote access through a port forwarding or similar setup. The attacker must also know the router's IP address and have login credentials for the web interface to modify router settings."
