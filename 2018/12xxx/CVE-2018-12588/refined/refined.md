Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12588

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of user-supplied input in the `searchQuery` template variable within the `searchResults.tpl` template file of the Open Monograph Press (OMP) software. Specifically the `catalog.noTitlesSearch` parameter which is used in the search field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected (non-persistent) XSS vulnerability. This means that malicious JavaScript can be injected through the search query and executed in the victim's browser when they view the search results page. The user-supplied input is not sanitized or escaped before being displayed on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script/HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the search results page.
- **Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
  - Stealing user cookies and session data.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Search Field:** The primary attack vector is the search field of the OMP software. By crafting a malicious search query, an attacker can inject XSS payloads.
- **Social Engineering:**  While the vulnerability is not critical and runs client-side, it requires social engineering to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a specially crafted query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the search query parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the crafted URL with the malicious payload or the attacker needs to trick the victim into entering a malicious search query directly.

**Affected Versions:**
- OMP versions 1.2.0 through 3.1.1-2 (inclusive)

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to OMP version 3.1.1-3 or later.
- Apply the provided patch by escaping the `searchQuery` variable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Metamorfosec.
- The issue was tracked in GitHub issue #3805
- The fix involved escaping the output of `searchQuery` in the `searchResults.tpl` file using the `|escape` modifier.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because it requires some user interaction and executes client-side.
