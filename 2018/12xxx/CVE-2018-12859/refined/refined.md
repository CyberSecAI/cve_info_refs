Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12859:

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-12859 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This vulnerability could lead to information disclosure.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read within the software. The specific vulnerable code is within the JP2KLib.dll library, which handles the parsing of JPEG2000 images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the application's memory. This could include system information, user credentials, or other sensitive data handled by the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious JPEG2000 image, which is then parsed by the vulnerable software.
- The crafted image could be delivered as part of a PDF document, or other file format that triggers the vulnerable parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted JPEG2000 file to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved by convincing a user to open a malicious PDF document containing the crafted image, or through other means of file delivery.

**Additional Details from the second document:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzing technique with WinAFL.
- Check Point Research discovered this vulnerability along with other 52 vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro.
- The affected component is the JPEG2000 image parser (JP2KLib.dll).
- A detailed methodology of how the researchers were able to find the bug is described, which includes writing a custom harness for the vulnerable library and using WinAFL to generate malicious test cases.
- The research highlights the importance of automated vulnerability finding tools (fuzzers).
