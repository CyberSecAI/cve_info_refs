{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The predictability of the `/docs/captcha_(number).jpeg` URI.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect Access Control. The CAPTCHA images are accessible without authentication and the naming scheme is predictable.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose the CAPTCHAs used by the access point and can elect to load the CAPTCHA of their choosing, leading to unauthorized login attempts to the access point.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker must be local to the network but unauthenticated to the administrator's panel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be on the local network."
