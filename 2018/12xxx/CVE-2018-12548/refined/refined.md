{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that OpenSSL natives within the `jdk.crypto.jniprovider.NativeCrypto` class in OpenJ9 builds are publicly accessible. These native methods take pointer values as parameters and dereference them directly in native code without proper validation or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference",
	  "CWE-590: Free of Memory Not on the Heap",
      "CWE-761: Improper Conversion of Numeric Types",
      "CWE-761: Improper Conversion of Numeric Types"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read or write to arbitrary memory locations, leading to crashes, data corruption, or even arbitrary code execution. This could lead to significant security breaches, including privilege escalation, or other unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct access to publicly available `jdk.crypto.jniprovider.NativeCrypto` class and its static natives",
        "Passing malicious pointer values to vulnerable native methods."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have access to the OpenJ9 0.11 build and ability to call public static methods with native code",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability does not reside within the OpenJ9 code itself, but in IBM OpenJDK extensions required for OpenJ9 builds."
