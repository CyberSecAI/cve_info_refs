  "CVE-2018-12114": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add a new administrator account.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, submits a form to add a new administrator account. The attack relies on the administrator's active session.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page under the attacker's control. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated; the targeted user's session is sufficient."
