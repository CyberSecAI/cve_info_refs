{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when processing the 'rzo' GET parameter in the 'ms_ipdiscover_analyse.php' file. This parameter is passed to the 'runCommand' function, which executes a Perl script using the 'exec()' function without any input validation or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "OS Command Injection",
      "Unsafe use of the exec() function"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server where OCS Inventory is installed.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request containing malicious code within the 'rzo' parameter to the 'ms_ipdiscover_analyse.php' page.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated on the OCS Inventory web platform or be able to hijack a session. If an authenticated user is not available, another option is to force an authenticated user to load in their browser an image pointing to an URL with the payload (the browser sends a GET request with the malicious payload when the image is viewed)."
