# USN-3793-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

15 October 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12376](/security/CVE-2018-12376), [CVE-2018-12377](/security/CVE-2018-12377),

[CVE-2018-12378](/security/CVE-2018-12378))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 58 and

then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12383](/security/CVE-2018-12383))

A crash was discovered in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL, which could

be triggered by data stored in the local cache directory. An attacker

could potentially exploit this in combination with another vulnerability

that allowed them to write data to the cache, to execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-12385](/security/CVE-2018-12385))

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

Package        : firefox-esr
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-12376 CVE-2018-12377 CVE-2018-12378

Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 52.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Firefox has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/60.0esr/releasenotes/>

In addition, the new Firefox packages require Rust to build. A
compatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is
not available for all architectures which previously supported the
purely C++-based Firefox packages. Thus, the new Firefox packages
don't support the armel, armhf, mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures
at this point.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 60.2.0esr-1~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.

For the detailed security status of firefox-esr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/firefox-esr>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

[crash.html (minimised testcase)](attachment.cgi?id=8986858)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8986858&action=edit)

The following testcase crashes the latest ASAN build of Firefox ESR 60 (BuildID=20180621121604). It requires the fuzzPriv extension and requires to be loaded from a HTTP server. I also requires the attached mini.xml in the same directory.
crash.html:
<script>
var xhrp=XMLHttpRequest;
function spin () {
var x=new xhrp();
try{x.open("POST","<https://mozilla.org>",false);}catch(e){}
try{x.send("X");}catch(e){}
}
function start() {
o5=document.createElementNS('[http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml','link](http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml%27%2C%27link)');
window.top.setTimeout(fun0, 400);
}
function fun0() {
o87=this;
window.top.requestAnimationFrame(fun1);
o5.href='mini.xml';
}
function fun1() {
fuzzPriv.trustedKeyEvent(o5,'press',false,false,false,false,13,0);
spin();
spin();
window.fuzzPriv.callDrawWindow(0);

I looked up the source code on DXR for ESR60: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr60/source/layout/base/nsRefreshDriver.cpp?q=RefreshDriverTimer&redirect_type=direct#313>
The code in that method looks like this:
for (nsRefreshDriver\* driver : drivers) {
...
TickDriver(driver, aJsNow, aNow);
mLastFireSkipped = mLastFireSkipped || driver->mSkippedPaints;
The second line is line 313. Based on the allocation stack, it looks like the object being touched in a UAF is a VsyncRefreshDriverTimer, though I don't see how that could be getting touched in line 313.
Line 313 is not present in trunk. After some digging around in the history, it looks like it was removed as being unused in [bug 1461946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1461946 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove nsRefreshDriver::GetRefreshTimerInterval").
Kats, could you take a look at this, or do you know somebody who could? Thanks.
I'm going to move this to layout, because the stacks involved look related to the refresh driver, and that's a little more layout than DOM. Hard to precisely say, though.Group: dom-core-security → layout-core-securityComponent: DOM → LayoutFlags: needinfo?(bugmail)

I get an ASAN error when accessing mLastChildTick here:

because 'this' was deleted (in RunRefreshDrivers 2 lines above).
This stack is when 'this' (in stack frame #65) is deleted.

The crash is quite hard for me to reproduce but I think this should fix it.
Nils, can you try this ASAN Try build and see if it fixes it for you?

IIUC, you're still reproducing a crash from after [bug 1461946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1461946 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove nsRefreshDriver::GetRefreshTimerInterval") landed? So all branches are affected?

Yeah, I suspect all supported versions are affected.
The issue might have been introduced by [bug 1332226](/show_bug.cgi?id=1332226 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider process more non-high priority runnables"), which added

So, this is obviously harmless, but VsyncChild is supposed to hold a strong reference to the observer, which presumably is cleared before shutdown. That's probably the reason this is only reproducible on shutdown...
Perhaps VsyncChild::RecvNotify is the right place to hold that strong ref?f
Otherwise it feels pretty weird that NormalPriorityNotify assumes someone holds a ref to the object, but NotifyVSync doesn't... Though I guess that runs off a runnable all the time so it's fine.
WDYT mats?
In any case, this looks fine even if we decide it's a short term fix.

Hmm, what guarantees that the timer isn't already deleted by the time we get to the timer function? There's other kind of flushes that can end up in nsRefreshDriver::Shutdown, right?
Should the caller of InitWithNamedFuncCallback AddRef the timer, and change this to:
RefPtr<RefreshDriverTimer> timer =
already\_AddRefed(static\_cast<RefreshDriverTimer\*>(aClosure));
?

I considered adding it there instead but I figured the other paths in
NotifyVsync already has strong refs through the Runnables and I didn't
want to add additional addrefs for perf reasons. (IIRC, this code is
somewhat perf sensitive.)
AFAICT, the added RefPtr is the only path that doesn't have it.
Also, the other paths runs async anyway, so adding a strong ref on
the stack in VsyncChild::RecvNotify doesn't really help except for
the path I'm fixing.

Right, it's somewhat implicit I guess. I can add a comment in
NotifyVsync saying that all paths there must have a strong ref
on 'this' while running the callbacks. Would that be enough?

I thought about that, but my assumption was that the timer is cancelled
if that happens so there will never be a callback in that case.

We have:
virtual ~SimpleTimerBasedRefreshDriverTimer() override
{
StopTimer();
}
so that should take case of any all subclasses of that,
but interestingly:
class VsyncRefreshDriverTimer : public RefreshDriverTimer
which doesn't seem to have something like that... hmm, looking...

though and doesn't have any callbacks like that, so I think we're fine.

I think it's the only timer that isn't assigned directly to the StaticRefPtrs, and using objects with a zero refcount is kind of a footgun.

No problem, I appreciate questions like that.
In general I think people should ask more critical questions
like that during review. It helps making sure all angles are
covered and also that everyone understands the issue in
the same way. Another good side effect is that it leaves
a trail in the bug of how people were thinking for future
readers (something that I often miss in decade old bugs).
So please, never hesitate to ask any question, they are
always very welcome.

how trigger it from that.

All.

The same changes works for esr60. I haven't tried esr52.

The patches just adds additional ref-counting to keep objects alive
for longer. There are no functional changes besides that.
It's very unlikely to cause regressions.
No specific testing is needed.

Fwiw, from a stylistic point of view I would actually prefer this:
- sRegularRateTimer = vsyncRefreshDriverTimer.forget();
+ sRegularRateTimer = std::move(vsyncRefreshDriverTimer);
but it seems StaticRefPtr doesn't have that assignment operator.
The reason I prefer std::move over .forget() is that the former is
something anyone can understand the semantics of whereas forget()
is a rather weird Mozilla thing.
I don't want to complicate this bug by adding the operator though.

(In reply to Al Billings [:abillings] from [comment #47](/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260#c47 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers"))
> Do both bugs cover the \*exact\* same flaw?
There are two separate flaws, each fixed by a separate patch here.
When I test the original rev in [bug 1452744](/show_bug.cgi?id=1452744 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /builds/worker/workspace/build/src/layout/base/nsRefreshDriver.cpp:309:26 in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers(long, mozilla::TimeStamp, nsTArray<RefPtr<nsRefreshDriver> >&)") (30d72755b174) I can
reproduce the "part 2" flaw there using Testcase #2.
After applying the "part 2" fix to that build I can reproduce
the "part 1" crash. So I think it's fair to say that we would
likely have found both flaws in that bug eventually.
> I ask for bounty purposes and for advisory purposes?
I'm reasonably sure it's the same underlying flaws in both bugs.
For bounty purposes I would recommend a shared discovery because
the testcase here definitely helped me fix it since it was
immediately reproducible.Flags: needinfo?(mats)

Hi Mats, I'm trying to put together some solid STR from the this bug and the information provided in [Bug 1452744](/show_bug.cgi?id=1452744 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /builds/worker/workspace/build/src/layout/base/nsRefreshDriver.cpp:309:26 in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers(long, mozilla::TimeStamp, nsTArray<RefPtr<nsRefreshDriver> >&)") to be able to reproduce faulty behavior before verifying the fix. Please correct these steps as needed.
STR:
1. Use an ASAN build from [Comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers") or [Comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers")
2. Install FuzzPriv extension from <https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/fuzzpriv>
3. Use the test case from [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1452744#c18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1452744#c18 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free /builds/worker/workspace/build/src/layout/base/nsRefreshDriver.cpp:309:26 in mozilla::RefreshDriverTimer::TickRefreshDrivers(long, mozilla::TimeStamp, nsTArray<RefPtr<nsRefreshDriver> >&)")

Right, ASAN builds from rev cbf9ea7c5531 or earlier should crash.

Don't use that build since that fix was incomplete.
Use the latest Nightly ASAN build to verify it's fixed.

Right, the STR for that bug is in that comment.
The testcase in this bug should crash too. It was more reproducible
for me, but if you have problems try opening / reloading it in tabs.Flags: needinfo?(mats)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12381: Dragging and dropping Outlook email message results in page navigation](#CVE-2018-12381)

Reporter
Jana Squires
Impact
low
##### Description

Manually dragging and dropping an Outlook email message into the browser will trigger a page navigation when the message's mail columns are incorrectly interpreted as a URL.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems with Outlook installed. Other operating systems are not affected.*

* [Bug 1435319](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319)

#### [#CVE-2018-12382: Addressbar spoofing with javascript URI on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12382)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.
*This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.*

##### References

* [Bug 1479311](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1479311)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-3761-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

6 September 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12375](/security/CVE-2018-12375), [CVE-2018-12376](/security/CVE-2018-12376), [CVE-2018-12377](/security/CVE-2018-12377),

[CVE-2018-12378](/security/CVE-2018-12378))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12383](/security/CVE-2018-12383))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.18.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.16.04.3)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [62.0+build2-0ubuntu0.14.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/62.0%2Bbuild2-0ubuntu0.14.04.3)

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make

all the necessary changes.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Actual results:

nsresult
KeyPath::ExtractKey(JSContext\* aCx, const JS::Value& aValue, Key& aKey) const

uint32\_t len = mStrings.Length();
JS::Rooted<JS::Value> value(aCx);
aKey.Unset();
for (uint32\_t i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
nsresult rv = GetJSValFromKeyPathString(aCx, aValue, mStrings[i],
value.address(),
DoNotCreateProperties, nullptr,
nullptr);
if (NS\_FAILED(rv)) {
return rv;
}
if (NS\_FAILED(aKey.AppendItem(aCx, IsArray() && i == 0, value))) {
NS\_ASSERTION(aKey.IsUnset(), "Encoding error should unset");
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INDEXEDDB\_DATA\_ERR;
}
}
aKey.FinishArray();
return NS\_OK;
}
GetJSValFromKeyPathString can execute js callback by setting a getter. In the callback, one can call deleteIndex free the KeyPath now using, which make mStrings invalid.

I think the best solution would be to do a clone before extracting keys, see [bug 1404274](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404274 "RESOLVED FIXED - Key Evaluation on the cloned JS objects").

Doing the restating for the patch on [bug 1404274](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404274 "RESOLVED FIXED - Key Evaluation on the cloned JS objects") here. The fix there looks great from a security perspective. I'll also comment about a nit or two on that bug.
Severity-wise, I'm not sure this bug is actually exploitable in a sec-critical sense. The KeyPath is used in a read-only fashion, specifically its mType and its nsTArray<nsString> mStrings. If the memory gets poisoned, we expect a crash dereferencing the array's mHdr. If the memory gets zeroed, we expect a null-crash on mHdr. If the memory got reused, we expect either nsTArray to crash because of an illegal index, or a potentially wild nsString read which potentially will cause a crash. If the wild string read could be controlled and the object being put() is actually a Proxy, the payload of the string (which is used as a key), could then I think be exposed to content. So in that case this would be sec-high. This would take some doing, however.
## The security problem
The getter deletes an index inside a version-change transaction. Because we don't perform a structured clone to create an inert object to process, all of [any objectstore key path traversal, the index path traversals, and the value structured clone itself] each provide an opportunity for content code to trigger unexpected re-entrancy through the use of getters/similar.
Aside: The logic in IDBObjectStore::GetAddInfo obtains a `const nsTArray<IndexMetadata>&` reference to `mSpec->indexes()`. mSpec is an IPDL ObjectStoreSpec instance. The logic also saves off indexes.Length() into idxCount for loop iteration, which is sketchy, but actually is somewhat helpful as nsTArray::ElementAt will force a crash if we subscript off the end of the array. However, this only happens if the index that's deleted is not already the last index, which it is in this case (and any intentional attack that wants to trigger the problem).
AppendIndexUpdateInfo takes a number of references to the current IndexMetadata's sub-fields at the time of entry. Of particular note is the KeyPath, which is a non-IPDL class nested inside the IPDL IndexMetadata. If mSpec->indexes()'s array is reallocated or freed, the KeyPath reference is now to freed memory. In this example case, we go from an array length of 1 to an array length of 0, so nsTArray ShrinkCapacity() will definitely be invoked and definitely free the memory out from under the KeyPath.
The actual freeing will occur in the helper function GetJSValFromKeyPathString. Its aKeyPathString will potentially be invalid after the JS engine call, however a use-after-free dereference will only occur there if we have a period-delimited string that was being tokenized. (The tokenizer's hasMoreTokens() won't dereference the string; it just compares pointers.) So we return to KeyPath::ExtractKey. The ASAN build then explodes inside the call to (this->)IsArray because `this` is now referencing freed memory. The non-ASAN build faults on the next turn of the loop on mStrings[i] because the array, which is also living in freed memory, has a poisoned mHdr value.
## The security fix
### Overview
By structured cloning the user-provided payload values into a cloned representation that we perform all subsequent traversals on, we can be confident that we won't be calling into user code that could cause re-entrancy that might violate invariants. This was already needed for correctness anyways, which is nice.
There is a performance consideration here, which is that there is a cost to structured clones, so if we're not going to perform any key-path traversals, then it's preferable that we execute only a single structured clone for the value itself. However, for security purposes, it's critical that there be no accumulated state on the stack that could be rendered invalid or a dangling pointer/reference from that structured clone itself.
### Entry-point auditing of potentially traversed values
Going from WebIDL here.
Stored values that can involve indices:
- IDBObjectStore.put/add:
- GetAddInfo now takes a ValueWrapper and that's propagated up to AddOrPut. GetAddInfo invokes the clones-at-most-once Clone() method if there's a primary key-path and if there are any indices.
- IDBCursor.update:
- We clone if there's a key-path. This is necessary to do rather than just letting GetAddInfo provide the coverage like in the above cases because we invoke KeyPath::ExtractKey on the provided value prior to calling into AddOrPut. That said, this logic seems redundant since the AddorPut call case should perform the same equivalent call and return the same error code via GetAddInfo(). We might want a follow-up to eliminate the redundant path.
Other "any" instances that aren't keys: None, hooray!

:janv authored the fixes, I just reviewed them, but I think the answer is: yes, we should uplift it. However, there was an oversight in the patch, thankfully caught by the ASAN build. That is tracked and was fixed on [bug 1478573](/show_bug.cgi?id=1478573 "RESOLVED FIXED - AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free [@ IsArray] with READ of size 4 with IndexedDB") and we want to uplift the combination of those two patches. :janv is out on PTO until Monday, so I'll put up the combination of the two on [bug 1404274](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404274 "RESOLVED FIXED - Key Evaluation on the cloned JS objects") for uplift approval momentarily.Flags: needinfo?(bugmail)

Yes, I requested an approval for that in [bug 1404274](/show_bug.cgi?id=1404274 "RESOLVED FIXED - Key Evaluation on the cloned JS objects").

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

## 类型/严重性

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights 补丁分析

识别并修复受此公告影响的系统。

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3403)

## 标题

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-25

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 60.2.1

Announced
October 4, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.2.1

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12377: Use-after-free in refresh driver timers](#CVE-2018-12377)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when refresh driver timers are refreshed in some circumstances during shutdown when the timer is deleted while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1470260](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260)

#### [#CVE-2018-12378: Use-after-free in IndexedDB](#CVE-2018-12378)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when an IndexedDB index is deleted while still in use by JavaScript code that is providing payload values to be stored. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1459383](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459383)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

##### References

* [Bug 1468523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

* [Bug 1473113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473113)

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12385: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data](#CVE-2018-12385)

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

* [Bug 1490585](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1490585)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

#### [#CVE-2018-12376: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62, Firefox ESR 60.2, and Thunderbird 60.2.1](#CVE-2018-12376)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```
