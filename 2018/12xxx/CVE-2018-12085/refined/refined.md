Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12085:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2018-12085, confirms the vulnerability, and provides additional details.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `parseChars` function within `compileTranslationTable.c` of Liblouis.
*   The vulnerability arises due to insufficient bounds checking when processing input strings. Specifically, the function writes data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without verifying if the input size exceeds the buffer capacity.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** This is the primary vulnerability, where writing beyond the allocated stack memory can corrupt program state, overwrite return addresses, or other important data, leading to crashes or even arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The `parseChars` function does not properly validate the input string length against the buffer size.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash due to the out-of-bounds write, causing a denial of service by terminating the application.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** A skilled attacker could potentially leverage this overflow to overwrite return addresses on the stack and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted input files:** The primary attack vector is through the use of specially crafted translation dictionary files that when processed by `lou_translate` trigger the buffer overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input file to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not require any authentication.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a user running the `lou_translate` or similar application, making it a local exploit
*   The attacker needs to provide the crafted input to an application that uses `liblouis`.
*   The attacker needs to have the user interact with a program that processes the malicious input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found via fuzzing.
*   Multiple SUSE security advisories address this vulnerability, indicating its impact across various SUSE products.
*   Ubuntu also addressed this in a security update.
*   The SUSE CVSS v3 score is much lower than the NVD score.

In summary, CVE-2018-12085 is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `parseChars` function of Liblouis caused by a lack of input validation, leading to DoS and potentially arbitrary code execution by providing a crafted dictionary.
