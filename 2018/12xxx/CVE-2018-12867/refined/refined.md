Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **Out-of-bounds read** within Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which could lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to **information disclosure**.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing a maliciously crafted file, likely a PDF or a related format (in this case, related to JPEG2000 processing, as the research paper indicates).
*   The vulnerability exists in the `JP2KLib.dll` library, used for parsing JPEG2000 images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious file that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing by vulnerable versions of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
*   The attacker would need to get the user to open the crafted file.

**Additional Details from Checkpoint Research:**

*   The Check Point Research document provides significant insight into how they discovered this and other vulnerabilities.
*   They used a fuzzer (WinAFL) to automatically generate test cases that triggered the vulnerability.
*   They specifically targeted the `JP2KLib.dll` library by writing a custom harness to fuzz it.
*   Their process involved reverse-engineering the library, identifying relevant functions, and creating a harness that allowed the fuzzer to effectively test the JPEG2000 parsing code.
*   The research highlights the effectiveness of automated fuzzing in finding vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was found as part of a larger effort that uncovered 53 critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro.
