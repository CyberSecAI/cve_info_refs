The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in Eaton Intelligent Power Manager v1.6. It is caused by insufficient input validation of the "firmware" parameter in the `node_upgrade_srv.js` script, allowing traversal using "../" sequences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization, specifically regarding the "firmware" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- Denial of service: potentially by reading large or resource-intensive files.
- Code execution: In specific circumstances, reading configuration files or other sensitive files can be leveraged for code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted GET request to `/server/node_upgrade_srv.js` with the `action=downloadFirmware` and a manipulated `firmware` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.
- An attacker can send the following request, for example, to get host file: `GET /server/node_upgrade_srv.js?action=downloadFirmware&firmware=/../../../../../../../../../../windows/System32/drivers/etc/host HTTP/1.1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Eaton Intelligent Power Manager v1.6 server.
- No authentication is mentioned, suggesting that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
