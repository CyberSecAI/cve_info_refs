  "CVE-2018-12023": {
    "Description": "The content provided discusses CVE-2018-12023, which is related to an improper polymorphic deserialization of types from the Oracle JDBC driver within the jackson-databind library. This vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution under certain circumstances.",
    "Root cause": "Improper polymorphic deserialization of types from the Oracle JDBC driver due to missing or insufficient blacklist.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Vulnerable dependency",
      "Improper polymorphic deserialization",
      "Incomplete blacklist"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution through deserialization of malicious payloads.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via a crafted JSON message",
       "Remote code execution",
	 "Deseriazliation of malicious payload"
	],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to craft malicious JSON payload.",
	  "Target must have the vulnerable jackson-databind library and oracle JDBC driver jar in the classpath.",
      "Target must be configured with default typing feature enabled"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "Multiple content snippets across different sources detail this vulnerability, mentioning its impact and describing that the jackson-databind library failed to properly block polymorphic deserialization of certain types. Some sources also list fixes in the jackson-databind library and list affected Oracle products."
