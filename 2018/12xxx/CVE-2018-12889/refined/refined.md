- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap buffer overrun due to a non-null terminated array when reading a binary CCNx or NDN file. Specifically, the issue occurs in `mkAddToRelayCacheRequest` and `ccnl_populate_cache`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overrun. The code does not properly handle the length of data read from a binary file, leading to writing beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Heap corruption. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires crafting a malicious CCNx or NDN binary file. The vulnerability can be triggered when parsing the crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted binary file to the vulnerable system. The file should have a data section that exceeds the length indicated by the corresponding TLV field.
