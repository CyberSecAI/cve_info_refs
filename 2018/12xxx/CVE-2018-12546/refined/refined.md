Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control in how Eclipse Mosquitto handles retained messages.  When a client publishes a message with the "retain" flag set, the broker stores that message for future subscribers. The vulnerability arises when a client's access to publish to a specific topic is revoked *after* they have already published a retained message to it.  Despite the access revocation, that retained message is still delivered to new subscribers of that topic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that the broker does not re-validate the publisher's permissions when delivering retained messages. It only checks the permissions of the *subscriber*. This allows a client to effectively bypass access control restrictions by leveraging a previously published retained message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can publish a retained message to a topic, and then, after their access has been revoked, the message can be used to cause effects on other clients. 
- **IoT Device Manipulation:** The provided example illustrates that an attacker, having previously gained write access to an IoT device (e.g., a smart lock) can set a retained message that will cause the device to act in an unauthorized manner when subscribed by other clients. This allows an attacker to regain control or cause malicious actions on the IoT device even after their access is revoked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the MQTT broker to publish messages.
- **Initial Write Access:** The attacker must have, at some point, had the ability to publish to the specific topic they are targeting, in order to publish a malicious retained message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **MQTT Client:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the MQTT broker using an MQTT client.
- **Temporary Write Access:**  The attacker needs to gain write access to the topic long enough to send a retained message.
- **Knowledge of target topic:** The attacker must have knowledge of the topic they intend to target to publish the retained message.
