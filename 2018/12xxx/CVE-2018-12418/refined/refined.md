The provided content is related to a commit and pull request that addresses a vulnerability related to parsing of RAR archive headers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and handling of header positions when reading RAR archives, which could lead to issues when processing corrupt files. Specifically, the code was not robust against corrupted files where the header positions could point to already processed positions causing an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate handling of corrupt RAR archives.
- Lack of tracking of processed header positions, allowing for potential loops when reading corrupt header information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a corrupted archive is parsed, the application could enter an infinite loop or throw an exception due to reading the same position multiple times. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or unexpected application behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a specially crafted or corrupt RAR archive to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious RAR file to be processed by the application.

**Technical Details**
The commit introduces changes in `Archive.java` to address the issue. Key changes include:

-   Adding a `processedPositions` set to keep track of positions already processed.
-   Before reading a new header, the code now checks if the new header position exists within processedPositions. If so, it throws a `RarException` with type `badRarArchive`.
-   The position is added to the set after a header has been successfully processed.
-   Adding a method to safely allocate byte arrays, which also throws a `RarException` if the requested size is larger than a maximum allowed size (`MAX_HEADER_SIZE`).

This patch enhances the robustness of the archive parsing process by preventing the issues caused by corrupt file headers and the allocation of very large buffers.
