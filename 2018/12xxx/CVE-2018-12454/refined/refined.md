The provided content describes a vulnerability in the 1000 Guess Ethereum lottery game, which is identified as CVE-2018-12454.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the predictable nature of the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used in the 1000 Guess smart contract. The contract generates a random number using the `sha256()` function with a private variable (`curhash`) and easily accessible block variables such as `block.timestamp`, `block.coinbase`, and `block.difficulty`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Exposed Private Variable:** The private variable `curhash` is not truly private and can be accessed using `web3.eth.getStorageAt` by specifying the storage slot where it is located.
2.  **Predictable Block Variables:** The block variables used in the PRNG are easily accessible and can be manipulated by malicious miners. However, even without being a miner, their values are predictable at the time of the transaction.
3.  **Lack of Secure Randomness:** The combination of an accessible private variable and predictable block variables allows for precomputation of the random number, making the lottery outcome predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can predict the winning number and manipulate the lottery to ensure they win. This results in the attacker gaining the lottery rewards while depriving other players of a fair chance of winning.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Direct Contract Interaction:** The attacker interacts with the 1000 Guess contract by betting until there's only one spot left.
2.  **Attack Contract Deployment:** The attacker deploys a separate smart contract that can compute the same random number as the 1000 Guess contract.
3.  **Internal Transactions:** The attack contract utilizes internal transactions to call the 1000 Guess contract within the same block, ensuring that the random number is calculated with the same variables as in the attack contract.
4.  **Precomputation and Trial and Error:** The attacker contract tries multiple times to generate a curhash that makes the attacker the winner by sending multiple transactions to the attack contract.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Smart Contract Deployment:** The attacker needs to be able to deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum network.
2.  **Ethereum Network Interaction:** The attacker must be able to interact with the Ethereum network and send transactions.
3.  **Access to Smart Contract Data:** The attacker must be able to read smart contract storage using `web3.eth.getStorageAt`.
4.  **Basic Understanding of Solidity and Smart Contracts:** The attacker needs to have a basic knowledge of smart contracts, solidity and be able to deploy and execute contracts on Ethereum.
5.  **No need to be a miner:** The attacker doesn't need to have control over mining the blocks to exploit this vulnerability
