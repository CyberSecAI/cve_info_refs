```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `liblnk_data_block_read` function in `liblnk_data_block.c` attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Heap-based buffer over-read.

Impact of exploitation:
Information disclosure. A remote attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the heap memory.

Attack vectors:
A crafted LNK file is used to trigger the vulnerability when processed by liblnk.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted LNK file to be processed by the vulnerable liblnk library.
