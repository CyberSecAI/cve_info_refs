  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-12116",
    "description": "Node.js 6 and 8 are vulnerable to HTTP request splitting. If Node.js can be convinced to use unsanitized user-provided Unicode data for the `path` option of an HTTP request, then data can be provided which will trigger a second, unexpected, and user-defined HTTP request to made to the same server.",
    "affected_versions": {
      "nodejs": [
        "6",
        "8"
      ]
    },
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Node.js not sanitizing user-provided Unicode data used in the `path` option of an HTTP request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Misinterpretation of Input (CWE-115)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a request that, when processed by Node.js, triggers a second, unintended HTTP request to the same server.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can provide malicious input to the `path` option when making an HTTP request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide unsanitized Unicode data that is used by a Node.js application for the `path` option in an HTTP request."
