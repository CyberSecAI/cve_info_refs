## Spend more time building

### Cache *plus-white* *minus-white*

Build better experiences that grow with you—with accessible, enterprise-grade caching built by the devs who brought you open source Redis.

```
res11 = r.json().set("newbike", "$", ["Deimos", {"crashes": 0}, None])

print(res11)  # >>> True

res12 = r.json().get("newbike", "$")

print(res12)  # >>> ['["Deimos", { "crashes": 0 }, null]']

res13 = r.json().get("newbike", "$[1].crashes")

print(res13)  # >>> ['0']

res14 = r.json().delete("newbike", "$.[-1]")

print(res14)  # >>> [1]

res15 = r.json().get("newbike", "$")

print(res15)  # >>> [['Deimos', {'crashes': 0}]]

### Vector *plus-white* *minus-white*

The best results are the results you were searching for. Make your AI app smarter and faster with streamlined document search, recommendation systems, semantic caching, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

```
# Create a vector index using the HNSW algorithm, 768 dimension length, and inner product distance metric

> FT.CREATE idx-videos ON HASH PREFIX 1 video: SCHEMA content_vector VECTOR HNSW 6 TYPE FLOAT32 DIM 768 DISTANCE_METRIC IP content TEXT metadata TEXT

# Add a video vector with metadata

> HSET video:0 content_vector "\xa4q\t=\xc1\xdes\xbdZ$<\xbd\xd5\xc1\x99<b\xf0\xf2<x[...\xf8<" content "SUMMARY:\nThe video discusses the limitations of MySQL at scale and introduces Redis Enterprise" metadata "{\"id\":\"FQzlq91g7mg\",\"link\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQzlq91g7mg\",\"title\":\"Redis + MySQL in 60 Seconds\"}"

(integer) 3

# Search for videos using a similar vector and the K-nearest neighbors algorithm

### Database *plus-white* *minus-white*

Use Redis as your NoSQL database to build fast, reliable apps that make five-9s uptime look easy.

```
# Create an index. In this example, all JSON documents with the key prefix 'user:' will be indexed.

rs = r.ft("idx:users")

rs.create_index(

    schema,

    definition=IndexDefinition(

        prefix=["user:"], index_type=IndexType.JSON

    )

)

# Use JSON.SET to set each user value at the specified path.

r.json().set("user:1", Path.root_path(), user1)

r.json().set("user:2", Path.root_path(), user2)

r.json().set("user:3", Path.root_path(), user3)

# Find the user Paul and filter the results by age.

res = rs.search(

    Query("Paul @age:[30 40]")

)

# Result:

# {1 total, docs: [Document {'id': 'user:3', 'payload': None, 'json': '{"name":"Paul Zamir","email":"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","age":35,"city":"Tel Aviv"}'}]}

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
