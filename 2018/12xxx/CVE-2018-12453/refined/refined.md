Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12453:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Type confusion in the `xgroupCommand` function within `t_stream.c`. The vulnerability occurs because the code doesn't properly check if the key provided to the `XGROUP` command is actually a stream. If the key is not a stream object, the code attempts to access stream-specific data, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Lack of proper type checking before accessing stream-specific data within the `xgroupCommand` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause the Redis server to crash, disrupting its availability.

**Attack vectors:**

- Sending a crafted `XGROUP` command to the Redis server. Specifically, the command needs to specify a key that is *not* a stream object (e.g. a key set via `SET`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the Redis server.
- The attacker must be able to send arbitrary commands to the Redis server.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `xgroupCommand` function within `t_stream.c` file of Redis source code.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```c
 if (c->argc >= 4) {
        robj *o = lookupKeyWriteOrReply(c,c->argv[2],shared.nokeyerr);
        if (o == NULL) return;
        s = o->ptr;
        grpname = c->argv[3]->ptr;
```
- The fix was to add a type check `checkType(c,o,OBJ_STREAM)` before proceeding which was done in the following way:

```c
 if (c->argc >= 4) {
        robj *o = lookupKeyWriteOrReply(c,c->argv[2],shared.nokeyerr);
        if (o == NULL || checkType(c,o,OBJ_STREAM)) return;
        s = o->ptr;
        grpname = c->argv[3]->ptr;
```
- This check ensures that if the key does not point to a valid stream object, the function returns, preventing the crash.

**Exploit:**
- The exploit is achieved by first setting a key using `SET` command, and then trying to use that same key with `XGROUP CREATE` command, which expects a stream data structure, not a simple string.
- Example using `redis-cli`:
```
127.0.0.1:1234> set a 123
OK
127.0.0.1:1234> xgroup create a b $
```

- Example using `netcat`:
```
set a 123
+OK
xgroup create a b $
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content confirms that this vulnerability was present in Redis versions prior to 5.0 and was fixed in 5.0.
- The fix ensures that the Redis server properly handles the cases where the `XGROUP` command is used with a key that is not a stream, preventing the crash.
