Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-12399:

**CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `registerProtocolHandler` API accepting a title argument that can be manipulated to mislead users about the domain registering the protocol handler.

*   **Weakness:**
    *   The API allows an arbitrary title, which is displayed in the notification bar when a new protocol handler is registered.
    *   This allows an attacker to make the origin of the handler registration appear different from the actual origin by spoofing the title.

*   **Impact:**
    *   A user might be tricked into approving a protocol handler from a malicious domain, believing it to be from a trusted source due to the spoofed title.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A malicious website could use the `registerProtocolHandler` API to register a custom protocol handler.
    *   By providing a misleading title in the API call, the attacker can trick the user into approving the protocol handler for their custom protocol.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website that the victim will visit in their Firefox browser.
    *   The attacker needs to craft JavaScript code using the `registerProtocolHandler` API, including a spoofed title.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by removing the title parameter from the notification bar string. The fix was implemented in Firefox 63. The fix involved:
    *   Removing the title parameter from the API
    *   Passing an empty string as the title in the UI.

This fix prevents the attacker from using a misleading title in the UI, which would reveal the correct origin.
