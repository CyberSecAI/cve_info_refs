Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the administration console of Micro Focus GroupWise. The console allows an authenticated administrator to upload files to arbitrary paths on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The core vulnerability is the ability to upload files to any location on the server's file system. This is a critical weakness, as it can lead to various exploits.
- **Insufficient Path Validation:** It can be inferred that the administration console does not properly validate or sanitize the file paths provided during the upload process.
- **Insecure File Handling:**  The console appears to lack appropriate checks to prevent the upload of malicious files such as web shells or executables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain circumstances, an attacker could upload and execute malicious code (e.g. a web shell, executable) leading to full control over the compromised system, which is the most significant potential impact.
- **Arbitrary File Manipulation:**  An attacker can potentially overwrite, create, or delete sensitive files on the server, impacting data integrity and system stability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack is conducted over a network, where the attacker interacts with the vulnerable GroupWise administration console remotely.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid administrator-level credentials to access and exploit the vulnerable file upload functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrator-Level Authentication:**  The attacker needs to have compromised or gained access to a valid administrative account on the GroupWise system. This is critical for exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to establish network connectivity to the GroupWise server in order to access the vulnerable web console.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content explicitly mentions that upgrading to Micro Focus GroupWise version 18.0.2 or newer resolves this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Vahagn Vardanyan and Arpine Maghakyan.
- This vulnerability is classified as a security alert.
