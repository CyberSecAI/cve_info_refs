# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c0)  MiloÅ¡ PrchlÃ­k    2019-04-15 07:09:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The latest run of upstream test suite reports following failed ld test cases:  FAIL: Build plt-main FAIL: Build plt-main with PIE FAIL: Build plt-main with PIE and -z bndplt FAIL: Build plt-main with -z bndplt FAIL: ld-x86-64/pltgot-1 FAIL: ld-x86-64/pltgot-2  I saved the whole buildroot (test suite was started after `rpmbuild -bb` in rpmbuild's BUILD) if it's of any help. If not, please let me know what'd help and I try to update my test suite wrapper to include such info.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  binutils-2.27-40.base.el7   How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.  Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c2)  Nick Clifton    2019-04-15 08:10:27 UTC  ``` Hi MiloÅ¡,  > FAIL: Build plt-main   > I saved the whole buildroot (test suite was started after `rpmbuild -bb` in > rpmbuild's BUILD) if it's of any help.  Yes - are you able to upload the ld.log file from the failing linker tests ? In particular I want to find out why the build of plt-main failed, as this is probably the cause of all of the following failures as well.  Cheers   Nick   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c3)  MiloÅ¡ PrchlÃ­k    2019-04-15 09:52:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Nick Clifton from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c2)) > Hi MiloÅ¡, >  > > FAIL: Build plt-main >  >  > > I saved the whole buildroot (test suite was started after `rpmbuild -bb` in > > rpmbuild's BUILD) if it's of any help. >  > Yes - are you able to upload the ld.log file from the failing linker tests ? > In particular I want to find out why the build of plt-main failed, as this > is probably the cause of all of the following failures as well. >  > Cheers >   Nick  Oh, I forgot to link the saved buildroot in the report :(  <https://beaker.engineering.redhat.com/recipes/6729575/tasks/91015902/logs/buildroot.tgz>  And extracted ld.log is here: <http://nest.test.redhat.com/mnt/qa/scratch/mprchlik/bz1699745-ld.log>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c4)  Nick Clifton    2019-04-15 12:12:38 UTC  ``` Hi Milos,    OK, I have managed to reproduce the problem and determine the cause.   Fortunately the issue is a mistake in the linker testsuite.  Or more   precisely it is a mistake in the patch that disables the generation   of the R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX relocs.  This patch changes the relocations   that are generated by the linker, but it failed to update the testsuite   to take this into account.  (Actually the patch does update the   testsuite, but it missed these checks).    I will create a patch to fix the tests and check it in once it is ready.  Cheers   Nick   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c5)  Nick Clifton    2019-04-15 13:13:46 UTC  ``` Fixed in binutils-2.27-41.base.el7   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c7)  MiloÅ¡ PrchlÃ­k    2019-06-11 11:26:14 UTC  ``` Verified with binutils-2.27-41.base.el7.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1699745#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:41:33 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **201908-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.32-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.32-r1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition or have other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.32-r1"

```

### Bug Description

Dear all,

The following binutils nm-new Stack-Overflow was found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the crashing input and an ASAN report.

Steps to reproduce:

Build current verison of binutils:

```

pull-lp-source binutils

cd binutils-2.30

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address

-fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make

```

Run inputs under ASAN:

```

ASAN\_OPTIONS=halt\_on\_error=true:allow\_addr2line=true ./nm-new a -C -l --synthetic $file

```

We can verify this issue for nm-new binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils").

The problem however is in the C++ name   demangler, which is part of the libiberty library.  This library is   maintained by the gcc project, not the binutils project.  (It is used   by the binutils, but now owned by them).  Therefore, please could you   refile this bug report on the gcc bugzilla system:  <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=gcc>    Thanks very much.  Cheers   Nick ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=85452#c0)  Sergej Schumilo    2018-04-18 14:29:36 UTC  ``` Dear all, according to the bintutils maintainers the following stack-overflow bug is in the C++ name demangler (instead of the binutils application nm-new), which is part of the libiberty library.   This is the original binutils bug report (<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23058>):  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear all, after reporting the following bugs to the Ubuntu security team ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/1763099](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/%2Bbug/1763099)), we were asked to report them directly to the binutils developers:   ----------------------------------------------------  Dear all, The following binutils nm-new Stack-Overflow was found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the crashing input and an ASAN report.  Steps to reproduce:  Build current verison of binutils: ``` pull-lp-source binutils cd binutils-2.30 CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make ```  Run inputs under ASAN:  ``` ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=true:allow_addr2line=true ./nm-new a -C -l --synthetic $file ```  We can verify this issue for nm-new binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils").  Credits: Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann (both of Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum)  Best regards, Sergej Schumilo ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=85452#c1)  Nick Clifton    2018-12-07 12:24:18 UTC  ``` Fixed with commit 266886 ``` |  |

# USN-4326-1: libiberty vulnerabilities

8 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in libiberty.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [libiberty](/security/cves?package=libiberty) - library of utility functions used by GNU programs

## Details

It was discovered that libiberty incorrectly handled parsing certain

binaries. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted binary, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libiberty to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [libiberty-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty)
  -
  [20170913-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20170913-1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

  -
  [20160215-1ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20160215-1ubuntu0.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
