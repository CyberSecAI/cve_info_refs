{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A stack exhaustion vulnerability exists in the C++ demangling functions within the libiberty library, specifically due to recursive stack frames in functions such as `demangle_arm_hp_template`, `demangle_class_name`, `demangle_fund_type`, `do_type`, `do_arg`, `demangle_args`, and `demangle_nested_args`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering the stack exhaustion, potentially crashing the application or system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted binary file (e.g., ELF, object, PE) that causes the C++ demangler to enter a deeply recursive call chain.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to a tool that uses the vulnerable `libiberty` demangling functions, such as `nm-new` or other tools within `binutils`."
