# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Database *plus-white* *minus-white*

Use Redis as your NoSQL database to build fast, reliable apps that make five-9s uptime look easy.

```
# Create an index. In this example, all JSON documents with the key prefix 'user:' will be indexed.

rs = r.ft("idx:users")

rs.create_index(

    schema,

    definition=IndexDefinition(

        prefix=["user:"], index_type=IndexType.JSON

    )

)

# Use JSON.SET to set each user value at the specified path.

r.json().set("user:1", Path.root_path(), user1)

r.json().set("user:2", Path.root_path(), user2)

r.json().set("user:3", Path.root_path(), user3)

# Find the user Paul and filter the results by age.

res = rs.search(

    Query("Paul @age:[30 40]")

)

# Result:

# {1 total, docs: [Document {'id': 'user:3', 'payload': None, 'json': '{"name":"Paul Zamir","email":"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","age":35,"city":"Tel Aviv"}'}]}

# b'OK'

Redis 4.0.13 Released Wed Feb 20 17:25:31 CEST 2019
================================================================================
This release just backports a few fixes from Redis 5:
60b2537f rewrite BRPOPLPUSH as RPOPLPUSH to propagate
afc4b36c Don't treat unsupported protocols as fatal errors
================================================================================
Redis 4.0.12 Released Tue Dec 11 18:06:12 CEST 2018
================================================================================
This backports the following Redis 5 fixes back into Redis 4.
Please check the Redis 5 changelog or see the full commit messages
for more information. Note that there are important fixes to the AOF
implementation so Redis 4.0.12 should be considered as a worthwhile
upgrade in production environments where AOF is used and there is the
idea of sticking with Redis 4 for some time.
b6cd3b3c asyncCloseClientOnOutputBufferLimitReached(): don't free fake clients.

Redis 4.0.11 Released Fri Aug 03 17:09:24 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: not critical but very important bugs fixed.
Dear users, this is just a bugfix release of Redis 4. All new work
is now focused on Redis 5, however we backported a number of bug fixes here:
\* The disconnection time between the master and slave was reset in an
incorrect place, sometimes a good slave will not be able to failover
because it claims it was disconnected for too much time from the master.
\* A replication bug, rare to trigger but non impossible, is in Redis for
years. It was lately discovered at Redis Labs and fixed by Oran Agra.
It may cause disconnections, desynchronizations and other issues.
\* RANDOMKEY may go in infinite loop on rare situations. Now fixed.
\* EXISTS now works in a more consistent way on slaves.
\* Sentinel: backport of an option to deny a potential security problem
when the SENTINEL command is used to configure an arbitrary script
to execute.
Many of these issues are there for a very long time, however upgrading
is a good idea.

Redis 4.0.10 Released Wed Jun 13 12:49:13 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes important security issues.
HIGH: This release fixes a SCAN commands family bug.
MODERATE: This release fixes a PSYNC2 edge case with expires.
MODERATE: Sentinel related fixes.
LOW: All the other issues
Redis 4.0.10 fixes a number of important issues:
\* Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017
for more information.
\* A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return all the elements.
We also add a regression test that can trigger the issue often when present, and
may in theory be able to find unrelated regressions.
\* A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving RDB files
because otherwise it is no longer possible to use such RDB file as a base
for partial resynchronization. It no longer represents the right state.
\* Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is disabled.
\* Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect that the master
was down immediately. A delay was added to the detection.
\* Other minor issues.

Redis 4.0.9 Released Mon Mar 26 17:52:32 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Critical upgrade for users using AOF with the
fsync policy set to "always".
Dear Redis users,
Redis version 4.0.9 adds a few interesting new features and fixes a very
critical bug regarding the Append Only File. Let's start with the bad news
(the critical bug), explaining what happens and in what conditions:
Critical AOF bug explained
--------------------------
When AOF is enabled with the fsync policy set to "always", we have a
(rarely used) setup where Redis fsyncs every new write on disk. On this
setup Redis MUST reply to the client with an OK code to the write, only
after the write is already persisted on disk.
Because of a bug, in particular conditions, it sometimes happens (verified
experimentally that the condition can be actually created) that in the
same event loop cycle the command is both processed and the reply sent, before
the beforeSleep() function has the ability to fsync the write on disk.
The redis 4.0.9 release fixes this problem introducing the concept of
write barriers in the Redis event loop (ae.c). If you are using a different
AOF setup, like fsync everysec, you are not affected because such guarantee
is not provided anyway. Similarly if you have fsync set to always but you
do not semantically use the fact that the reply is only sent after the
successful fsync, you may avoid upgrading.
Other bugfixes
--------------
Other things that we fixed in this release include:
\* Latency monitor could report wrong latencies under certain conditions.
\* AOF rewriting could fail when a backgronud rewrite is triggered and
at the same time the AOF is switched on/off.
\* Redis Cluster crash-recovery safety improved.
\* Other smaller fixes (check commnits).
New features
------------
\* Redis Cluster has now the ability to configure certain slaves so that
they'll never attempt a failover.
\* Keyspace notifications API in modules.
\* RM\_Call() is now faster by reusing the same client.
\* Tracking of the percentage of keys already logically expired but yet
not evicted.
\* Other smaller improvements (check commits)

Redis 4.0.8 Released Fri Feb 2 11:17:40 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL ONLY for Redis Cluster users. Otherwise no reason
to upgrade at all.
Redis 4.0.8 fixes a single critical bug in the radix tree data structure
used for Redis Cluster keys slot tracking. The problem was actually fixed
10 months ago into unstable, but it was fixed in a commit related to Streams
so it was never backported (for error) into the 4.0 branch.
The problem will crash Redis Cluster instances during deletions, but it is
very hard to trigger: only when the node removed is in the edge of a memory
mapped area there are the conditions to create an issue, because otherwise
the code just accesses an out of range word in read-only way in an allocated
structure: this is almost always harmless.
The single commit in this release:
f603940f Rax updated to latest antirez/rax commit. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.7 Released Wed Jan 24 11:01:40 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Several bugs fixed, but none of critical level.
Dear Redis Users,
Redis 4.0.7 addresses a number of problems and adds a few things that are
very useful to have and was worth to backport into a patchlevel release.
Here is a list of the most important things, but you can find the full list
of commits below as usually:
\* Many 32 bit overflows were addressed in order to allow to use Redis with
a very significant amount of data, memory size permitting. (zhaozhao.zz,
Oran Agra)
\* MEMORY USAGE fixed for the list type. (gnuhpc)
\* Allow read-only scripts in Redis Cluster. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix AOF pipes setup in edge case. (heqin)
\* AUTH option for MIGRATE. (AlexStocks, Salvatore Sanfilippo, Fabio Nicotra)
\* HyperLogLogs are no longer converted from sparse to dense in order
to be merged. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix AOF rewrite dead loop under edge cases. (heqin)
\* Fix processing of large bulk strings (>= 2GB). (Oran Agra)
\* Added RM\_UnlinkKey in modules API. (Dvir Volk)
\* Fix Redis Cluster crashes when certain commands with a variable number
of arguments are called in an improper way. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix memory leak in lazyfree engine. (zhaozhao.zz)
\* Fix many potentially successful partial synchronizations that end
doing a full SYNC, because of a bug destroying the replication
backlog on the slave. So after a failover the slave was often not able
to PSYNC with masters, and a full SYNC was triggered. The bug only
happened after 1 hour of uptime so escaped the unit tests. (Oran Agra)
\* Improve anti-affinity in master/slave allocation for Redis Cluster
when the cluster is created. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Improve output buffer handling for slaves, by not limiting the amount
of writes a slave could receive. (Guy Benoish)
The full list of commits follow.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.6 Released Thu Dec 4 17:54:10 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: More errors in the fixes for PSYNC2 in Redis 4.0.5
were identified.
This release fixes yet more errors present in the 4.0.5 fixes, that could
affect slaves. Moreover another critical issue in quicklists, when they are
used at a massive memory scale, was fixed in this release. Upgrading from
any 4.0.x release, especially if you are running 4.0.4 or 4.0.5, is highly
recommended.
Note that while this fix for 4.0.6 was written in an hurry as well, this
time we took extra precautions in order to avoid writing a broken patch:
1. The code was reviewed by two developers independently.
2. A regression test about the problem introduced in 4.0.4/5 was added.
3. Resisting to duplicated Lua scripts loading into the Lua engine is now
the default action of the loading function, thus it's simpler to stress
its behavior.
4. The code section was tested with Valgrind.
The following is the list of commits included in this release:

Redis 4.0.5 Released Thu Dec 1 16:03:32 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 4.0.4 fix for PSYNC2 was broken, causing the
slave to crash when receiving an RDB file from the
master that contained a duplicated Lua script.
Please upgrade ASAP if you are with 4.0.4 and you use any form of Lua scripting
because this problem will easily crash Redis.

after a restart and a successful PSYNC2 handshake.
This is a quick followup to Redis 4.0.3 since I forgot to add a few fixes...
that are actually described in the 4.0.3 changelog (but not in the list of
commits). Basically it's the following commits, implementing the ability
to persist scripts into RDB files for a successful PSYNC, otherwise a corruption
could happen when a slave is restarted and receives EVALSHA from the master
about scripts it does not know:
8449227f PSYNC2: Fix off by one buffer size in luaCreateFunction().
eeac1d35 PSYNC2: just store script bodies into RDB.
fb0441a8 PSYNC2: luaCreateFunction() should handle NULL client parameter.
0429db3c PSYNC2: Save Lua scripts state into RDB file.
d06fbbdd Regression test: Slave restart with EVALSHA in backlog issue #4483.
ab3d3aca Prevent corruption of server.executable after DEBUG RESTART.
b7c7edf9 Be more verbose when DEBUG RESTART fails.
Please upgrade ASAP to 4.0.4 becuase 4.0.3 had an incomplete set of fixes.
Cheers and sorry for the 4.0.3 fiasco ;-)

Redis 4.0.3 Released Thu Nov 30 13:14:50 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several PSYNC2 bugs can corrupt the slave data set
after a restart and a successful PSYNC2 handshake.
Hi all, Redis 4.0.3 contains several bug fixes to different parts of Redis 4.0,
but the highlight is definitely in the "PSYNC after restart" that the new
RDB format, containing replication metadata information, was able to provide
to Redis 4.0. There were several bugs that are addressed in this release.
Moreover several LFU fixes improve the ability of Redis to correctly estimate
the popularity of keys. This release also fixes important bugs in Redis modules,
including bugs related to replication of modules commands, reloading the same
module multiple times, and other related things. Finally there is even a
security fix related to loading a corrupted Cluster state from a corrupted
file. We advice to upgrade ASAP. Check the list of commits for credits, several
people helped a lot in this release. I'm grateful to each of them.
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.2 Released Thu Sep 21 15:47:53 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several potentially critical bugs fixed.
Hello, this release addresses several significant bugs in Redis 4.0:
1. A number of bugs were fixed in the area of PSYNC2 replication in the
specific area of restarting an instance with an RDB file having the
repliacation meta-data to continue without a full resynchronization. The
old code allowed several inconsistencies under certain conditions, like
starting a master with an RDB file generated by a slave, and later using
such master to connect previous slaves having the same replication history.
Because of other bugs, sometimes the replication resulted in a full
synchronization even if actually a partial resynchronization was possible
and so forth. Several commits by different authors fix different bugs here.
2. AOF flush on SHUTDOWN did not cared to really write the AOF buffers
(not in the kernel but in the Redis process memory) to disk before exiting.
Calling SHUTDOWN during traffic resulted into not every operation to be
persisted on disk.
3. The SLOWLOG could reference values inside string objects stored at keys,
creating a race condition during FLUSHALL ASYNC while the DB is reclaimed
in another thread.
There are other smaller bugs addessed in this relase, see the full commit
history below for more information.
A big thank you to all the contributors of this release. Without the
help I received, Redis 4.0 would take a much longer time to mature. It's
a real pleasure to work together with people around the world, while making
Redis better.

Redis 4.0.1 Released Mon Jul 24 15:51:31 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A few serious but non critical bugs in the modules
subsystem. A rare Redis Cluster crash fixed.
Many other minor fixes.
Hi everybody. This is the first patch level release of Redis 4.0, fixing the
obvious last minute issues discovered just after the 4.0.0 GA release, plus
a few other things that were no-brainers. The highlights here in terms
of bug fixing are:
1. Loading two or more modules exporting native data types resulted into the
inability to reload the RDB file.
2. Crash in modules when calling from Lua scripts module commands that would
block.
3. A Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of the "migrate-to" internal
flag.
4. Other smaller fixes not worth of a release per se, but nice to add here.
If you upgraded to 4.0 to use modules, definitely a required upgrade.
If you are using Redis Cluster, also a good idea to upgrade.
Otherwise... You can definitely wait for the next one :-)
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.0 Released Fri Jul 14 13:04:44 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: 4.0.0 GA fixes many important bugs.
Dear Redis users,
this is the first stable version of Redis 4.0. There are a number
of bug fixes and improvements compared to the previous RC, mainly:
\* Different replication fixes to PSYNC2, the new 4.0 replication engine.
\* Modules thread safe contexts were introduced. They are an experimental API right now, but the API is considered to be stable and usable when needed.
\* SLOWLOG now logs the offending client name and address. Note that this is a backward compatibility breakage in case old code assumes that the slowlog entry is composed of exactly three entries.
\* The modules native data types RDB format changed.
\* The AOF check utility is now able to deal with RDB preambles.
\* GEORADIUS\_RO and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER\_RO variants, not supporting the STORE option, were added in order to allow read-only scaling of such queries.
\* HSET is now variadic, and HMSET is considered deprecated (but will be supported for years to come). Please use HSET in new code.
\* GEORADIUS huge radius (>= ~6000 km) corner cases fixed, certain elements near the edges were not returned.
\* DEBUG DIGEST modules API added.
\* HyperLogLog commands no longer crash on certain input (non HLL) strings.
\* Fixed SLAVEOF inside MULTI/EXEC blocks.
\* Many other minor bug fixes and improvements.
Note that 4.0 is probably one of the most extreme releases of Redis ever
made in terms of changes inside the internals: all the aggregated data types
no longer use Redis Objects structures but directly SDS objects, certain
deletion operations are now threaded, the replication engine was modified
in many ways. So please handle this release with care. A few patch-level
releases will follow in the next weeks and months fixing the important issues
discovered by the users.
You can read the new set of features below in this file, there are a lot
of improvements that can make a real difference in real world use cases.
Also note that Redis 4.0 is, as usually, almost a perfect superset of Redis
3.2, so it is very rare that compatibility with the past is broken in terms
of exported commands.
IMPORTANT: Redis Cluster users, please note that, as specified in the list
of incompatibilities, Redis 4.0 cluster bus protocol is not compatible with
Redis 3.2, so in order to upgrade, a mass reboot of the instances is needed
and rolling upgrades are not possible. This change was needed in order to
add compatibility for Containers/NAT, where the bus port at a fixed offset
was not an acceptable design, so we had to change many things, resulting
in the incompatible protocol.
Have fun with Redis 4.0!

Redis 4.0-RC3 Released Sat Apr 22 11:19:56 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed and many improvements operated, so who
is using 4.0 RC2 should upgrade if possible, or at least
should carefully read this release notes to understand if
it may be affected by some bug.
Redis 3.9.103 (4.0 RC3 for the friends) is finally out, and the list of commits
is pretty long, so here is a synopsis of all the major changes operated in this
release.
Major things:
\* Finally the infamous leakage of keys with an expire, in slaves that are
configured as writable, is fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* A serious MIGRATE issue forgetting to store the TTL of the key under
certain conditions is fixed. (reported by Jinbei Wang, fixed by Jan-Erik
Rediger).
\* An in-depth investigation of the ziplist implementation was performed.
The final result was:
1. An in depth auditing (Salvatore Sanfilippo and Oran Agra).
2. The discovery of a bug and its fix (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
3. The creation of a new specification to replace ziplists with something
better, listpacks: https://gist.github.com/antirez/66ffab20190ece8a7485bd9accfbc175 (Yuval Inbar, Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra).
4. Refactoring and function to dump a ziplist for debugging purposes
(Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* New major feature: Memory de-fragmentation. This feature, contributed by
Oran Agra, allows Redis to perform "online defragmentation" of memory
if the Jemalloc allocator is used. There is some documentation in the
example `redis.conf` file. (Oran Agra)
\* Support for ARM. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix a very important "family of bugs" about PSYNC2, thanks to the help
of Kevin McGehee, Siran Yang and Oran Agra.
\* Hash function moved to SipHash 1-2 variant. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Redis Cluster failure detection improved in different ways, the most
important result is to exchange a lot less messages among nodes. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
All the rest:
\* A bug in the modules API ziplist iterator was fixed. (Dvir Volk).
\* The HyperLogLog implementation final cardinality approximation function
was improved to use the LogLog-Beta algorithm. (Harish Murthy and
Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* Edge case copy-on-write disaster fix (Oran Agra).
\* Now the Redis ASCII art logo is shown only if logging to stdout and if the
stdout is a tty. (Salvatore Sanfilippo because of users request).
\* A new GEO bug fixed (and there is another pending when huge radiuses are
used, where elements at the edge may be miss-reported). (Salvatore
Sanfilippo). \*\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*\* See the list of incompatibilities below
since the GEO API has some potentially backward incompatible change.
\* ZADD crash on syntax error fixed. (Itamar Haber)
\* Fixed a division by zero but in MEMORY DOCTOR. (Jan-Erik Rediger)
\* More MIGRATE bugs fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Different file descriptors potential lakes fixed. (multiple authors)
\* Support for Solaris improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Improve memory reclaiming in freeMemoryIfNeeded(). (Oran Agra and
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fixes multiple bugs in the test suite. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix asynchronous commands in modules API. (Dvir Volk and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* A new data structure, the radix tree (rax.c) was introduced into Redis in
order to fix a major Redis Cluster slowdown. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix `lua-time-limit` config ignored in `redis.conf`. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Jemalloc downgraded to an apparently safe version, given that recent
releases apparently hang under certain conditions. See Redis issue #3799.

Redis 4.0.0-RC2 Released Tue Dec 06 09:25:35 CET 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW: This release mainly fixes a rare GEO API bug and a crash
related to the modules subsystem.
Redis 4.0.0-RC2 (version number 3.9.102) just fixes two bugs:
1. GEORADIUS could fail reporting items with very big radius lengths because
of a bug in the bounding box computation function. This was fixed and tests
with large radius sizes were added.
2. There was a crash in the modules subsystem that was not merged into RC1 for
an error, while it was already fixed into the "unstable" branch.
The list of commits follows:

Redis 4.0.0-RC1 Released Fri Dec 2 10:40:01 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC1 (version number 3.9.101) is the first release candidate of
Redis 4.0. It is not a production quality release but all the major features
received some testing at this point, the release in feature freeze excluding
things that are considered in the middle ground between fixes and improvements.
Redis 4.0 is not called 3.4 because it is a major release that adds a number
of important and non trivial features. Many core functionalities of Redis were
seriously reworked. In the next release candidates, with your help, we'll gain
informations about the stability level of this release and will produce a new
RC every 2-4 weeks. When the entity and frequency of bug reports will slow down
under a certain level, Redis 4.0 final will be released.
As usually, certain changes to Cluster and Sentinel may not follow the Redis
release cycle and could be incorporated into Redis 4.0 at RC stage or even
after the final version, every time the changes are considered to benefit
the user base enough to be worth incorporating them ASAP without waiting
for Redis 4.2.
So, what's new in Redis 4.0?
Major features
---
\* Redis modules system. Redis now allows developers to write modules that can extend the Redis functionalities and implement new data types. The module API implements a complete abstraction layer that separates the Redis core from the module implementation, allowing the same module to be loaded by different versions of Redis without modifications. See the modules documentation here for more info: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md
\* Partial Replication (PSYNC) version 2. The replication protocol was enhanced (in a backward compatible way, so that 4.0 can still act as a slave of older instances) in order to be able to partially resynchronize slaves and masters in conditions where it was impossible in the past: after a master switch because of a failover and when a slave instance is restared. Even masters turned into slaves will usually be able to partially resynchronize with the new master, if the new master was a former slave of the old master instance. The way the replication work for chained slaves (sub-slaves) is now very different, and each slave receives the same replication stream generated by the top-level master.
\* Cache eviction improvements. Redis 4.0 implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) as a new eviction algorithm, and improves the functionality, performances and precision of the existing algorithms. This blog post contains info about the changes: http://antirez.com/news/109
\* Lazy freeing of keys. Redis is now able to delete keys in the background in a different thread without blocking the server. The new `UNLINK` command is the same as `DEL` but working in a non blocking way. Similarly an `ASYNC` option was added to `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` in order to let the entire dataset or a single database to be freed asynchronously.
\* Mixed RDB-AOF format. If enabled the new format is used when rewriting the AOF file: the rewrite uses the more compact and faster to generate RDB format, and an AOF stream is appended to the file. This allows faster rewrites and reloads when using the AOF persistence.
\* A new MEMORY command, able to perform memory analysis of different kinds: troubleshooting of memory issues (with MEMORY DOCTOR, similar to LATENCY DOCTOR), reporting of the amount of memory used by a single key, more in-depth reporting of Redis memory usage compared to what the INFO command offers.
\* Redis Cluster support for NAT / Docker. There are new functionalities in order to force cluster instances to announce specific sets of IP address, client and bus ports, to the rest of the cluster, regardless of the auto detected IP. This required a bus protocol change that will force users to mass-restart all the nodes of a Redis 3.2 installation in order to upgrade to 4.0.
\* Redis uses now less memory in order to store the same amount of data. The gain depends a lot on the kind of dataset stored.
\* Redis is now able to defragment the used memory and reclaim space incrementally
while running. See the example `redis.conf` for more information.
Smaller features
---
\* Improvements to the RDB format to support 64 bit lengths, binary sorted set scores, and more. The RDB file check utility now uses the same code base of the one used by Redis itself in order to load the RDB file in memory.
\* SWAPDB command: ability to completely and immediately (no latency) replace two Redis databases.
\* Improvements to `dict.c`, the Redis hash table implementation.
\* Security improvements mapping POST and Host: commands to QUIT in order to prevent cross protocol scripting attacks.
\* RPUSHX and LPUSHX now accept a variable number of elements.
\* Reporting of additional memory used by copy on write in the INFO output.
\* Serious refactoring of many core parts of Redis.

Migrating from 3.2 to 4.0
=========================
Redis 3.2 is mostly a strict subset of 4.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.2 to 4.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 4.0 release:
\* The Redis Cluster bus protocol of 4.0 is no longer compatible with Redis 3.2.
This was needed in order to provide Docker / NAT compatibility to Redis
Cluster. SO in order to upgrade a Redis Cluster to 4.0, a mass restart of
all the instances is needed.
\* Redis Cluster CLUSTER NODES output is now slightly different. Nodes
addresses are now in the form host:port@bus-port instead of host:port.
Clients should use CLUSTER SLOTS in order to fetch the cluster configuration
however if they are still using CLUSTER NODES, they should be modified in
order to ignore the @bus-port part.
\* Writable slaves do not propagate writes to their sub-slaves, so writes to
writable slaves remain just local.
\* The RDB format changed. Redis 4.0 is still able to read 3.2 (and all the
past versions) files, but not the other way around.
\* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 4.0.
\* Certain INFO fields, especially related to replication, are now different.
\* GEODIST, GEOPOS and GEOHASH return values changed for non existing keys:
Previously the return value was inconsistent between non existing key
and non existing elements. Now the return is always like if the key
contains no elements if the key does not exist. So, for instance,
"GEOHASH non\_existing\_key A B C" now returns an array of 3 NULL values
as it should. In general this change should not break compatibility with
the past since in the past two different forms were provided by the server
and the new behavior is one of the two.
\* The SLOWLOG command entires contain additional two fields: the client address
and name. This is documented in the SLOWLOG command online documentation.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

=======================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:
LOW: No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH: There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
SECURITY: There are security fixes in the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.14 Released Mon Oct 4 12:00:00 IDT 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.
Security Fixes:
\* (CVE-2021-41099) Integer to heap buffer overflow handling certain string
commands and network payloads, when proto-max-bulk-len is manually configured
to a non-default, very large value [reported by yiyuaner].
\* (CVE-2021-32762) Integer to heap buffer overflow issue in redis-cli and
redis-sentinel parsing large multi-bulk replies on some older and less common
platforms [reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research].
\* (CVE-2021-32687) Integer to heap buffer overflow with intsets, when
set-max-intset-entries is manually configured to a non-default, very large
value [reported by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz, AWS].
\* (CVE-2021-32675) Denial Of Service when processing RESP request payloads with
a large number of elements on many connections.
\* (CVE-2021-32672) Random heap reading issue with Lua Debugger [reported by
Meir Shpilraien].
\* (CVE-2021-32628) Integer to heap buffer overflow handling ziplist-encoded
data types, when configuring a large, non-default value for
hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries
or zset-max-ziplist-value [reported by sundb].
\* (CVE-2021-32627) Integer to heap buffer overflow issue with streams, when
configuring a non-default, large value for proto-max-bulk-len and
client-query-buffer-limit [reported by sundb].
\* (CVE-2021-32626) Specially crafted Lua scripts may result with Heap buffer
overflow [reported by Meir Shpilraien].
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.13 Released Wed Jul 21 16:32:19 IDT 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues that affect
authenticated client connections on 32-bit versions. MODERATE otherwise.
Fix integer overflow in BITFIELD on 32-bit versions (CVE-2021-32761).
An integer overflow bug in Redis version 2.2 or newer can be exploited using the
BITFIELD command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code
execution.
Bug fixes:
\* Fix overflows on 32-bit versions in GETBIT, SETBIT, BITCOUNT, BITPOS, and BITFIELD (#9191)
\* Fix ziplist length updates on big-endian platforms (#2080)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.12 Released Mon Mar 1 17:29:52 IST 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: LOW, fixes a compilation issue.
Bug fixes:
\* Fix compilation error on non-glibc systems if jemalloc is not used (#8533)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.11 Released Mon Feb 22 16:48:25 IST 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY if you use 32bit build of redis (see bellow), LOW
otherwise.
Integer overflow on 32-bit systems (CVE-2021-21309):
Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk
input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms.
If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client
may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer
overflow and heap corruption.
Bug fixes:
\* Avoid 32-bit overflows when proto-max-bulk-len is set high (#8522)
\* Fix an issue where a forked process deletes the parent's pidfile (#8231)
\* Fix flock cluster config may cause failure to restart after kill -9 (#7674)
\* Avoid an out-of-bounds read in the redis-sentinel (#7443)
Platform and deployment-related changes:
\* Fix setproctitle related crashes. (#8150, #8088)
Caused various crashes on startup, mainly on Apple M1 chips or under
instrumentation.
\* Add a check for an ARM64 Linux kernel bug (#8224)
Due to the potential severity of this issue, Redis will refuse to run on
affected platforms by default.
Modules:
\* RM\_ZsetRem: Delete key if empty, the bug could leave empty zset keys (#8453)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.10 Released Mon Oct 26 09:21:49 IST 2020
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY if you use an affected platform (see below).
Otherwise the upgrade urgency is MODERATE.
This release fixes a potential heap overflow when using a heap allocator other
than jemalloc or glibc's malloc. See:
https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/7963
Other fixes in this release:
\* Avoid case of Lua scripts being consistently aborted due to OOM
\* XPENDING will not update consumer's seen-time
\* A blocked XREADGROUP didn't propagated the XSETID to replicas / AOF
\* UNLINK support for streams
\* RESTORE ABSTTL won't store expired keys into the DB
\* Hide AUTH from MONITOR
\* Cluster: reduce spurious PFAIL/FAIL states upon delayed PONG receival
\* Cluster: Fix case of clusters mixing accidentally by gossip
\* Cluster: Allow blocked XREAD on a cluster replica
\* Cluster: Optimize memory usage CLUSTER SLOTS command
\* RedisModule\_ValueLength support for stream data type
\* Minor fixes in redis-check-rdb and redis-cli
\* Fix redis-check-rdb support for modules aux data
\* Add fsync in replica when full RDB payload was received

Redis 5.0.9 Released Thu Apr 17 12:41:00 CET 2020
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency:CRITICAL if you use Streams with AOF ore replicas.
Otherwise the upgrade urgency is LOW.
This release has a speed improvement and a critical fix:
\* FIX: XREADGROUP when fetching data in a blocking way, would not
emit the XCLAIM in the AOF file and to replicas. This means
that the last ID is not updated, and that restarting the server
will have the effect of reprocessing some entries.
\* NEW: Clients blocked on the same key are now unblocked on
O(1) time. Backported from Redis 6.
Commits:
1fc8ef81a Fix XCLAIM propagation in AOF/replicas for blocking XREADGROUP.
a5e24eabc Speedup: unblock clients on keys in O(1).
================================================================================

Redis 5.0.7 Released Tue Nov 19 17:52:44 CET 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: many issues fixed, some may have an impact.
Hi all, Redis 5.0.7 fixes a number of bugs, none is very critical, however
there are a few that may have an impact. It's a good idea to upgrade.
There are fixes in the area of replication from modules commands and
callbacks, AOF fsync (non critical issue), memory leaks (very rare and small),
streams beahvior (non critical), and a potential crash in commands
processing multiple keys at the same time that is there for years, and happens
very rarely, but is not impossible to trigger.

Redis 5.0.6 Released Wed Sep 25 12:33:56 CEST 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Only in case of exposed instances to untrusted users.
This Redis release, 5.0.6, is a bugfix and enhancement release. The most
important bugfix is a corruption related to the HyperLogLog. A malformed
HyperLogLog string could cause an invalid access to the memory. At a first
glance the vulnerability appears to be not exploitable but just a DoS. The
way to trigger the issue is complex, we'll not provide any information about
how to do that for the users safety.
Other significant changes in this release:
\* New modules APIs merged from Redis unstable to Redis 5.
\* Some memory optimization related to objects creation.
\* Fixes to flushSlaveOutputBuffer() that make sure that SHUTDOWN will
transfer pending buffers to replicas.

Redis 5.0.5 Released Wed May 15 17:57:41 CEST 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes an important AOF fysnc bug
and other less critical issues.
Dear user,
Redis 5.0.5 fixes an important issue with AOF and adds multiple very useful
modules APIs. Moreover smaller bugs in other parts of Redis are fixed in
this release.
The AOF bug
-----------
The AOF bug happens when the fsync policy is set to "everysec", which is the
default: if the write load in the server drops immediately, the commands
executed in the latest second may not be fsync-ed to disk as it should.
This may lead to data loss in case the write load drops immediately and
successively a server crash happens.
Other things in this release
----------------------------
\* Streams: a bug in the iterator could prevent certain items to be returned in
range queries under specific conditions.
\* Memleak in bitfieldCommand fixed.
\* Modules API: Preserve client->id for blocked clients.
\* Fix memory leak when rewriting config file in case of write errors.
\* New modules API: RedisModule\_GetKeyNameFromIO().
\* Fix non critical bugs in diskless replication.
\* New mdouels API: command filtering. See RedisModule\_RegisterCommandFilter();
\* Tests improved to be more deterministic.
\* Fix a Redis Cluster bug, manual failover may abort because of the master
sending PINGs to the replicas.
The following is the full list of commmits.

Salvatore

Redis 5.0.4 Released Mon Mar 18 17:12:53 CET 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes several Redis stability issues.
Dear Redis users, this release includes a number of fixes for bugs that may
result in Redis crashing in special conditions (not normal usage, but specific
artificial conditions), fixes to certain Redis behaviors especially around
Redis streams, and finally a set of new APIs for Redis Modules.
Specifically:
\* Hyperloglog different coding errors leading to potential crashes were fixed.
\* A replication bug leading to a potential crash in case of plain misuse of handshake commands was fixed.
\* XCLAIM command incrementing of number of deliveries was fixed.
\* LFU field management in objects was improved.
\* A potential overflow in the redis-check-aof was fixed.
\* A memory leak in case of API misuse was fixed.
\* ZPOP\* behavior when count is 0 is fixed.
\* A few redis-cli --cluster bugs were fixed, plus a few improvements.
\* Many other smaller bugs.
We suggest to upgrade Redis, especially in case your instance is facing
untrusted users (for instance Cloud providers) because several of these
bugs could result in unwanted crashes.

Redis 5.0.3 Released Tue Dec 11 18:17:26 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Redis 5 is consolidating, upgrading is a good idea.
However there is nothing very critical here, but certain
issues resolved could lead to very rare crashes.
Welcome to Redis 5.0.3, several interesting bug fixes here:
\* Redis no longer panics when you send data to a replica-mode connection that
is in MONITOR or SYNC mode.
\* Fixes to certain sorted set edge cases. You are unlikely to ever notice those
issues, but now it is more correct.
\* Certain BSD variants now are better supported: build & register logging
on crash.
\* The networking core now recovers if an IPv6 address is listed in bind but
is actually not able to work because there is no such protocol in the
system.
\* redis-cli cluster mode improved in many ways. Especially the fix subcommand
work was enhanced to cover other edge cases that were still not covered
after the work done for Redis 5.
\* MEMORY USAGE is now more accurate.
\* DEBUG DIGEST-VALUE added in case you want to make sure a given set of keys
(and not the whole DB) are excatly the same between two instances.
\* Fix a potential crash in the networking code related to recent changes
to the way the reply is consumed.
\* Reject EXEC containing write commands against an instance that changed role
from master to replica during our transaction.
\* Fix a crash in KEYS and other commands using pattern matching, in an edge
case where the pattern contains a zero byte.
\* Fix eviction during AOF loading due to maxmemory triggered by commands
executed in loading state.
The following is the list of commmits if you want to check credits or dig
further in the details.
commit 2c6ee0f9b3d9ca48c6da8bd18796186784216bff
Author: antirez
Date: Wed Dec 12 11:37:15 2018 +0100
freeMemoryIfNeeded() small refactoring.
Related to issue #5686 and PR #5689.
commit 107e93e75acfd5def0252efb6870751940816395
Author: zhaozhao.zz
Date: Wed Dec 12 00:25:24 2018 +0800
evict: don't care about mem if loading
When loading data, we call processEventsWhileBlocked
to process events and execute commands.
But if we are loading AOF it's dangerous, because
processCommand would call freeMemoryIfNeeded to evict,
and that will break data consistency, see issue #5686.

Redis 5.0.2 Released Thu Nov 22 11:22:37 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: CRITICAL if you use streams and consumer groups.
HIGH if you use redis-cli with Redis Cluster.
LOW otherwise.
Welcome to Redis 5.0.2. This release fixes two issues with Streams consumer
groups, where items could be returned duplicated by XREADGROUP when accessing
the history, and another bug where XREADGROUP can report some history even
if the comsumer pending list is empty. Both problems were addressed and unit
tests to avoid regressions implemented. Moreover this release fixes some
issue with redis-cli when in cluster mode. Finally some FreeBSD and DragonFly
build problems are now resolved. The list of the commits is below.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

Redis 5.0.1 Released Wed Nov 07 13:09:30 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: URGENT if you use Redis Streams. MODERATE otherwise.
Hi all, this is the first patch level release of Redis 5. It contains
both fixes and improvements. Here there is a list of the major ones, however
read the commit messages at the end of the changelog if you want to know
more about the smaller things. Let's start with the new features:
\* Sentinel now supports authentication! Check the Sentinel official doc
for more info.
\* Redis-cli cluster "fix" is now able to fix a big number of clusters put
in a bad condition. Previously many corner cases were not covered.
Now the critical fixes:
1. Fix RESTORE mismatch reply when certain keys already expired.
2. Fix an XCLAIM non trivial issue: sometimes the command returned a wrong
entry or desynchronized the protocol.
And now the other fixes:
3. Stack trace generation on the Raspberry PI (and 32bit ARM) fixed.
4. Don't evict expired keys when the KEYS command is called, in order to
avoid a mass deletion event. However expired keys are not displayed
by KEYS as usually.
5. Improvements in the computation of the memory used, when estimating
the AOF buffers.
6. XRANGE COUNT of 0 fixed.
7. "key misses" stats accounting fixed. Many cache misses were not counted.
8. When in MULTI state, return OOM while accumulating commands and there
is no longer memory available.
9. Fix build on FreeBSD and possibly others.
10. Fix a crash in Redis modules, thread safe context reply accumulation.
11. Fix a race condition when producing the RDB file for full SYNC.
12. Disable protected mode in Sentinel.
13. More commands now have the HELP subcommand.
14. Fixed an issue about adaptive server HZ timer.
15. Fix cluster-replica-no-failover option name.
Finally, this is the list of commits. Enjoy Redis 5.0.1!

================================================================================
Redis 5.0.0 Released Wed Oct 17 13:28:26 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several fixes to streams AOF and replication.
Hi all and welcome to the first stable release of Redis 5! \o/
To start a quick recap of what's new in Redis 5:
1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
- Better propagation of Lua scripts to replicas / AOF.
- Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the replica as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.
However the list above really does not do justice to the changes of Redis 5
since the core was improved in many ways during the development of the new
version. However certain changes were back ported into Redis 4 once they were
sensed as safe, because many improvements were hard to distinguish from fixes.
The most important user facing improvement is without doubts the introduction
of the new general purpose data type after years: the streams.
Note that we worked to improve and fix streams till a few hours ago, so while
we are not aware of critical bugs in this release, surely there is to handle it
with some care for the first weeks. Bug reporting will be highly appreciated and
we are ready to work immediately to release 5.0.1 once there is enough important
stuff to justify a new release (probably soon).
People not using the streams can have probably a better production-ready
experience with Redis 5, also because many internals are shared with Redis 4
so the jump is not as big as it was between 3.2 and 4 in terms of how things
internally work.
Well, many thanks to the Redis community and the developers that made
this release possible, contributing bug reports, patches, new features, working
on the clients, sometimes debugging problems for days. Also thank to everybody
that adopted Redis for their use cases making things work for users worldwide.
The list of commits in this release follows.
Cheers,
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 5.0-rc6 Released Wed Oct 10 11:03:54 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed especially in the context of streams.
This is probably the last release candidate of Redis 5. The Redis 5 GA version
will be released 17th of October. The main highlights of this release are:
\* Critical AOF bug, as old as AOF itself: if an open MULTI/EXEC block is at
the end of the AOF file, Redis would still read the half-transaction when
reloading back the AOF.
\* The slave name was removed from logs and documentation, now replica is used
instead.
\* LOLWUT command added.
\* New modules APIs: Disable Redis Cluster redirection.
\* New modules APIs: Sorted dictionaries data type.
\* Modules APIs fixes: timer / cluster messages callback now can call RM\_Call().
\* Fix for #5024 - commandstats for multi-exec were logged as EXEC.
\* A number of optimizations and fixes for the stream data type.
\* Many other stability improvements.

Redis 5.0 RC5 Released Thu Sep 06 12:54:29 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several imporant bugs fixed.
Hi all,
This is the release candidate number five, and has a lot of bug fixes inside,
together with a few big changes to the Redis behavior from the point of view
of replication of scripts and handling of the maxmemory directive in slaves.
Make sure to read the whole list!
\* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Slaves now ignore maxmemory by default.
\* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Now scripts are always replicated for their effects, and
never sending the script itself to slaves/AOF.
\* Improvement: Big pipelining performances improved significantly.
\* Fix: Rewrite BRPOPLPUSH as RPOPLPUSH to propagate.
\* Fix: False positives in tests.
\* Fix: Certain command flags were modified because not correct.
\* Fix: Fix blocking XREAD for streams that are empty.
\* Improvement: Allow scripts to timeout on slaves as well.
\* Fix: Different corner cases due to CLIENT PAUSE are now fixed.
\* Improvement: Optimize parsing large bulk greater than 32k.
\* Fix: Propagate read-only scripts as SCRIPT LOAD, not as EVAL.
The following is the list of commits, so that you can read the details and
check the credits of the commits.

Redis 5.0 RC4 Released Fri Aug 03 13:51:02 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency
HIGH: Many non critical but important issues fixed.
CRITICAL for Stream users: Many important bugs fixed.
Hi all, welcome to Redis 5.0 RC4.
This release is a huge step forward in Redis 5 maturity and fixes a number
of issues. It also provides interesting improvements. Here I'll summarize
the biggest one, but laster you can find the full list of commits:
Fixes:
\* A number of fixes related to Streams: stability and correctnes.
\* Fix dbRandomKey() potential infinite loop.
\* Improve eviction LFU/LRU when keys are created by INCR commands family.
\* Active defragmentation is now working on Redis 5.
\* Fix corner case in Redis CLuster / Sentinel failover, by resetting the
disconnection time with master in a more appropriate place.
\* Use a private version of localtime() to avoid potential deadlocks.
\* Different redis-cli non critical fixes.
\* Fix rare replication stream corruption with disk-based replication.
Improvements:
\* Sentinel: add an option to deny online script reconfiguration.
\* Improved RESTORE command.
\* Sentinel command renaming: allows to use Sentinel with Redis instances
that have non standard command names.
\* CLIENT ID and CLIENT UNBLOCK.
\* CLIENT LIST now supports a TYPE option.
\* redis-cli --cluster now supports authentication.
\* redis-trib is now deprecated (use redis-cli --cluster).
\* Better slaves output buffers efficiency.
\* Faster INFO when there are many clients connected.
\* Dynamic HZ feature.
\* Improvements in what the MEMORY command is able to report.
\* Add year in log. (WARNING: may be incompatible with log scraping tools)
\* Lazy freeing now works even when values are overwritten (for instance SET).
\* Faster ZADD when elements scores are updated.
\* Improvements to the test suite, including many new options.

================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC3 Released Wed Jun 14 9:51:44 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW:
This release fixes compilation of Redis RC2. For an error the commit from unstable
updating the Rax library was not merged into the 5.0 branch.
================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC2 Released Wed Jun 13 12:49:13 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes important security issues.
HIGH: This release fixes a SCAN commands family bug.
MODERATE: This release fixes a PSYNC2 edge case with expires.
MODERATE: Sentinel related fixes.
LOW: All the other issues
NOTE: This release breaks API compatibility with certain APIs that were
introduced in Redis 5.0 RC1. Notably ZPOP\* now returns score/element in reverse
order. XINFO  special form was removed, now XINFO STREAM  must be
used to obtain general information about the stream.
Redis 5.0 RC2 ixes a number of important issues:
\* Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017
for more information.
\* A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return all the elements.
We also add a regression test that can trigger the issue often when present, and
may in theory be able to find unrelated regressions.
\* A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving RDB files
because otherwise it is no longer possible to use such RDB file as a base
for partial resynchronization. It no longer represents the right state.
\* Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is disabled.
\* Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect that the master
was down immediately. A delay was added to the detection.
\* XREADGROUP would crash when the master had attacked slaves.
\* Replication and events generation of several streams command were fixed.
\* XREVRANGE fixed, in some cases it could not return elements, or crash the
server, or in general not behave correctly.
\* ZPOP can now unblock multiple clients in a sane way.
\* Other minor issues.
Moreover this release adds new features:
\* XGROUP DESTROY and XGROUP SETID.
\* RDB loading speedup.
\* Configurable stream macro node limits (number of elements / bytes).
\* More smaller improvements.
The following is the list of commits composing the release, please check
the commit messages and authors for credits.

Redis 5.0 RC1 Released Tue May 29 14:14:11 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 5.
Introduction to the Redis 5 release
===================================
Redis 5 is a release focused on a few important features. While Redis 4
was very very focused on operations, Redis 5 changes are mostly user-facing,
with the implementation of new data types and operations on top of existing
types. The following are the major features of this release:
1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
- Better propagation of Lua scripts to slaves / AOF.
- Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the slave as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.
Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

Migrating from 4.0 to 5.0
=========================
Redis 4.0 is mostly a strict subset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 4.0 to 5.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 5.0 release:
\* redis-cli now implements the cluster management tool. We still ship the
old redis-trib, but new fixes will be implemented only in redis-cli.
See `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
\* The RDB format changed. Redis 5.0 is still able to read 4.0 (and all the
past versions) files, but not the other way around.
\* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 5.0.
\* Now by default maxmemory is ignored by slaves, and used only once a slave
is promoted to master. It means that in setups where you want slaves to
enforce maxmemory in an independent way from the master (that will anyway
stream the key eviction DEL commands), you should active this feature manually
and make sure you understand that it breaks consistency if writes are not
always idempotent. TLDR: the new behavior is much better for 99.999% of use
cases, revert it if you really know what you are doing.
\* Scripts are only replicated by their \*effects\* and not by sending EVAL/EVALSHA
to slaves or the AOF log itself. This is much better in the general case
and in the future we want to totally remove the other possiblity of
propagating scripts the old way (as EVAL). However you can still turn this
back to the default via the non-documented (if not here) Redis configuration
directive "lua-replicate-commands yes" or
"DEBUG lua-always-replicate-commands 0". However note that Redis 6 may
completely remove such feature.
\* Because of the above change related to scripts replication, certain Redis
commands that in Redis 4 had their result ordered lexicographically before
being passed to Lua via the return value of redis.call(), now have a behavior
more similar to calling the commands directly from a normal client. For
instance the ordering of elements returned by SMEMBERS or SDIFF is now
undetermined in Lua, exactly as it is by default when calling the commands
from a non-scripting context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A1860)

## Topic

An update for rh-redis32-redis is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10192)
* redis: Heap corruption in lua\_cmsgpack.c (CVE-2018-11218)
* redis: Integer overflow in lua\_struct.c:b\_unpack() (CVE-2018-11219)
* redis: Code execution in redis-cli via crafted command line arguments (CVE-2018-12326)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# RHSA-2019:0052 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: redis security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0052)

## Topic

An update for redis is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap corruption in lua\_cmsgpack.c (CVE-2018-11218)
* redis: Integer overflow in lua\_struct.c:b\_unpack() (CVE-2018-11219)
* redis: code execution via a crafted command line (CVE-2018-12326)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-22 14:34:03 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Redis before 4.0.10 and 5.x before 5.0 RC2. A buffer overflow in redis-cli allows an attacker to achieve code execution and escalate to higher privileges via a crafted command line.   References: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/4.0/00-RELEASENOTES> 	 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES> <https://gist.github.com/fakhrizulkifli/f831f40ec6cde4f744c552503d8698f0> 	 	 <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44904/> 	  Patch: <https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/9fdcc15962f9ff4baebe6fdd947816f43f730d50>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-22 14:34:52 UTC  ``` Created redis tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1594294](show_bug.cgi?id=1594294 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-12326 redis: code execution via a crafted command line [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c2)  Joshua Padman    2018-06-26 03:45:10 UTC  ``` The Redis command line tool "redis-cli" is vulnerable to a buffer overflow through the -h (host) command line parameter. If using redis-cli directly this could cause a self DoS or code execution with the same privilege level the command was executed with. This is unlikely to impact the security of the system as the attacker would already require access. It is possible that products are built to call redis-cli and may allow an attacker with access to the layered product to gain command execution on the underlying system. This would require the unfiltered host parameter to be passed from the layered product to redis-cli  Specific to OpenStack: The default key-value data store in OpenStack is memcached. Regardless, none of the components that are included with Red Hat OpenStack make calls to redis-cli in a way that would allow the host value to be manipulated.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-16 17:11:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2019:0052 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0052](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0052)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-16 17:57:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2019:0094 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0094](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0094)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1594291#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-25 16:08:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2019:1860 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1860](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1860)   ``` |  |

## Description

Buffer overflow in redis-cli of Redis before 4.0.10 and 5.x before 5.0 RC3 allows an attacker to achieve code execution and escalate to higher privileges via a crafted command line. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which redis-cli is used with, for example, a -h (aka hostname) argument from an untrusted source.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# RHSA-2019:0094 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: redis security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0094)

## Topic

An update for redis is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap corruption in lua\_cmsgpack.c (CVE-2018-11218)
* redis: Integer overflow in lua\_struct.c:b\_unpack() (CVE-2018-11219)
* redis: code execution via a crafted command line (CVE-2018-12326)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack for IBM Power 13 ppc64le
* Red Hat OpenStack 13 x86\_64
* Red Hat OpenStack Director Deployment Tools 13 x86\_64
* Red Hat OpenStack Director Deployment Tools for IBM Power LE 13 ppc64le
