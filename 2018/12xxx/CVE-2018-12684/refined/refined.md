The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12684.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing length check before using `memcmp` when parsing Server Side Includes (SSI) tags in the `send_ssi_file` function. Specifically, the code did not verify if the input buffer `buf` was large enough before comparing it with "include" or "exec" keywords, potentially leading to a read out-of-bounds condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: Lack of proper bounds checking before using `memcmp` on the buffer `buf` when processing SSI directives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to a denial-of-service or information disclosure. In more severe cases, it could lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the memory layout and access privileges of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user can craft a specific HTTP request containing a specially crafted SSI tag that causes the `send_ssi_file` function to access memory beyond the allocated buffer. This can be triggered by sending a crafted file to be parsed by civetweb.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application using the vulnerable civetweb library. They need to be able to control the content of the SSI tags being processed.
