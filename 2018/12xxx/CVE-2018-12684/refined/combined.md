[![@leonwxqian](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17214835?u=2c142c0f846770c2fe6b1f56079e71762f1d8a94&v=4&size=48)](/leonwxqian)[leonwxqian](https://github.com/leonwxqian)opened [on Jun 15, 2018](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb/issues/633#issue-332660214)

Hello, during security auditing of other product that use your library, we have found 3 vulnerabilities in civetweb and want to report them to you. 1 of them is considered to be fatal (remote code execution) so we want to report by email. We've found this line in civetweb/docs/Contribution.md:

" In case you think you found a security issue that should be evaluated and fixed before public disclosure, feel free to write an email. “

But I couldn't find any email address in the docs, would you please offer your email address so we can send the detailed report to you? Thank you.
