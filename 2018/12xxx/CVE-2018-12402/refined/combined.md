List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Follow-up from [bug 1460538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1460538 "RESOLVED FIXED"):
STR:
1. open:
chrome://browser/content/places/?%27\*{}\*{color:red}
as a toplevel URL
AR:
we show a directory index of the places folder, but we echo the query string into the resulting HTML as-is.
ER:
we shouldn't echo the query string or hash.
We may also want to consider enforcing other restrictions on chrome/resource URLs (e.g. has to match #^[.a-z0-9/\_-]\*$#, so only latin alphanumeric, forward slashes as path separators, '.', '\_' and '-', nothing else). We probably can't reliably enforce any restrictions on file:/// URIs, so sadly probably can't enforce such restrictions on all directory indices.

[Bug 1488061](/show_bug.cgi?id=1488061 "VERIFIED FIXED - Directory indices shouldn't just echo all URL input") - Remove Query/Ref from the directory listing URI r=bagder!
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
Security issue that we've landed fixes for on trunk.
User impact if declined: potential for CSP bypass
Fix Landed on Version: 63 ([bug 1460538](/show_bug.cgi?id=1460538 "RESOLVED FIXED")) / 64 ([bug 1488061](/show_bug.cgi?id=1488061 "VERIFIED FIXED - Directory indices shouldn't just echo all URL input"))
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): very low - this reduces what parts of the URI we display in directory listings.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: n/a
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 63

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 63

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

* [Bug 1487478](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478)

#### [#CVE-2018-12398: CSP bypass through stylesheet injection in resource URIs](#CVE-2018-12398)

Reporter
cgvwzq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using the reflected URL in some special resource URIs, such as `chrome:`, it is possible to inject stylesheets and bypass Content Security Policy (CSP).

* [Bug 1488061](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488061)

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
BjÃ¶rn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

* [Bug 1469916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916)

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12401: DOS attack through special resource URI parsing](#CVE-2018-12401)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

* [Bug 1422456](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422456)

#### [#CVE-2018-12403: Mixed content warning is not displayed when HTTPS page loads a favicon over HTTP](#CVE-2018-12403)

Reporter
YiÄŸit Can Yilmaz
Impact

##### Description

If a site is loaded over a HTTPS connection but loads a favicon resource over HTTP, the mixed content warning is not displayed to users.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Dana Keeler, Ronald Crane, Marcia Knous, Tyson Smith, Daniel Veditz, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Loading a file: resource is blocked when viewing pages over HTTP/HTTPS. However, when saving the page, any embedded file: resources are accessed. This may expose the user to SMB Relay Attacks, allowing to steal Windows user credentials.
Steps to reproduce:
Some definitions:
Victim pc: the "victim's pc".
HTTP server: a remote machine running a webserver.
SMB server: a remote machine hosting "smbtrap", a Python-based SMB server that steals Windows user credentials.
1. HTTP server: From the attached ZIP, upload poc.html to this machine, so it can be accessed through e.g.
<http://192.168.1.128/poc.html>
2. SMB server: Make sure to use Python 2.7.x. Also, install the Tornado 4.4.2 package, e.g. through "pip":
sudo pip install tornado==4.4.2
3. SMB server: Make sure the host machine has the IP address 192.168.1.128 (or change the hardcoded address in poc.html).
4. SMB server: Download "smbtrap2.py" and "quickcrack.py" from
<https://github.com/CylanceSPEAR/SMBTrap/tree/master/smbtrap>
and run SMBtrap through
sudo python smbtrap2.py
5. Victim pc: Open Firefox, and navigate to
<http://192.168.1.128/poc.html>
6. Victim pc: Save the web page to disk (File > Save Page As)
7. Victim pc: Observe that SMBtrap receives the user's username and NTLM password hash.
See also attached screenshot "smbtrap\_output.png" (in the ZIP) for example output.
Note: quickcrack.py contains a small "dictionary" for demonstration purposes. If the victim's password is one of those listed, SMBtrap will be able to derive the actual password from the NTLM hash.
Actual results:
Firefox accesses the file: resource, which is a path to an SMB resource. This may expose the user to SMB Relay attacks.
Expected results:
Firefox should not have accessed the file: resource when the web page is served over HTTP/HTTPS.

Jonathan, I don't suppose you have cycles to take this? In nsWebBrowserPersist and friends, we need to start doing something else than blindly passing system principal (esp. for subloads).
X-ref [bug 1415636](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415636 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Arbitrary local file read through the abuse of \"Save Page\" and \"file:///\" URI") which is due to the same issue (and marked dupeme, but I couldn't quickly find a dupe). Note that this is somewhat different as it doesn't require the user to load the resulting saved document, which probably makes this more severe. I don't know if the remote smb server stuff would apply to every single windows setup, but we should probably assume the worst.Group: firefox-core-security â†’ core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED â†’ NEWComponent: Untriaged â†’ DOMEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(jkt)Product: Firefox â†’ Core

Assuming I'm reading this right, we should have realized this in [bug 1099296](/show_bug.cgi?id=1099296 "RESOLVED FIXED - Attach LoadInfo to remaining callers of ioService and ProtocolHandlers"), but it got missed. :-(

I just noticed step 2 doesn't list the correct dependencies for SMBtrap. This step should be:
Use Python 2.7, and install the following SMBtrap dependencies:
\* Bitarray version 0.8.1
\* PyCrypto version 2.6.1
\* Impacket version 0.9.12
For example, through:
sudo pip install bitarray==0.8.1
sudo pip install pycrypto==2.6.1
sudo pip install impacket==0.9.12

Can I ask why this is rated as sec-low?
The vulnerability allows disclosure of OS username, NTLM hash and (depending on password strength) the plaintext password as well. Having both credentials may be used as a stepping stone in further attacks (for example, authenticate to the local SMB server and steal arbitrary local files). This seems to meet the requirements for sec-moderate as listed at [1].

Due to the mitigating circumstance of requiring the user to save the webpage to disk, which is a relatively rare user interaction for websites.

I see. My understanding though is that sec-low is intended for leaks of non-sensitive information, which to me does not sound like the proper classification. On the other hand, sec-moderate does appear to cover unusual user interaction:
"Client bugs that might have high or critical results but require the user to perform unusual or complex actions to trigger."

Now that this bug has been fixed, would it be possible to re-assess the severity rating?
My apologies for repeating, but for completeness sake, please allow me to summarize:
\* Bug type:
This bug allows information disclosure and can be easily used as a stepping stone for RCE:
- Attackers can immediately obtain the victim's Windows username and NTLM hash.
- Finding a pre-image (the Windows user password) for NTLM hashes is a matter of minutes with various NTLM lookup services available online (e.g. [1][2][3]). Alternatively, one can use hashcat to bruteforce it fairly quickly (especially when using GPGPU acceleration) [4].
\* Impact:
Having both the Windows username and password may be used as a stepping stone in further attacks. For example, authenticate to the local SMB server and steal arbitrary local files, or run arbitrary code (RCE).
\* User interaction:
IMHO saving a webpage is quite a common use case, but it's understandable to have different views on this. Nevertheless, 'sec-moderate' allows for unusual user interaction as indicated in [5]:
"Client bugs that might have high or critical results but require the user perform unusual or complex actions to trigger."
Comparing the above description against the requirements for 'sec-moderate' leads me to believe this is the appropriate severity rating. If I'm mistaken, I would highly appreciate your feedback on this. Thanks.

Unfortunately it won't be, [bug 332676](/show_bug.cgi?id=332676 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"Save as complete\" gives access to content from other domains") is about what happens if the victim actually opens the saved file. The point of this bug is that you don't even need to open the saved file, the access happens immediately as soon as you save the attacker's document. That is now fixed.

Note that you then want to take a few different patches to avoid some crashes + regressions, see [bug 1469916 comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - SameSite Cookies leakage via \"Save Page As...\"") -- and probably the fix for [bug 1504159](/show_bug.cgi?id=1504159 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Save Image As..\" doesn't work for mixed content images") on top of that, too.

Thanks. I'll look over it and the patches Gijs points to when preparing the next release. We'll probably want to test that in an alpha release first, though, given that there has been quite some fallout after the first fix.Flags: needinfo?(gk)

Talking to Dan and Gijs it sounds like this isn't serious enough for us to backport to esr60 given the risk. And Tor already know about this so they can choose to carry the needed patches.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL

file: urls have no referrer, I wonder if we mess up on whether the sub-resources are 3rd party requests or not? I'm not sure how we could (comparing "" to any host shouldn't be true), but if that's the problem we might also be sending cookies when the user has disabled 3rd-party cookies.Group: firefox-core-security â†’ network-core-securityComponent: Untriaged â†’ Networking: CookiesKeywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)Product: Firefox â†’ Core

I don't think that's what the issue is because if I browse file URL directly, it doesn't send SameSite cookies at all. It only happens when saving the page and only with those 4 tags.

This is all because nsIWebBrowserPersist is a giant mess. We have other bugs about this. They're all not particularly severe, but there's a bunch of them and we should just clean it up.

[Bug 1469916](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916 "VERIFIED FIXED - SameSite Cookies leakage via \"Save Page As...\"") - use principals in webbrowserpersist code to ensure proper OA, samesite cookie behavior, etc.

So... I wrote up a fairly ugly big patch to try to teach webbrowserpersist some manners about principals. I think this will also fix some other issues we have on file, like how we fetch URLs outside of containers when saving pages from a container tab etc...
The problem I'm having is that although with the patch we pass a loading principal to the load triggered by webbrowserpersist, it seems we end up calling <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/681eb7dfa324dd50403c382888929ea8b8b11b00/netwerk/protocol/http/HttpBaseChannel.cpp#3424-3439>
(HttpBaseChannel::AddCookiesToRequest), which via GetCookieStringFromHttp and GetCookieStringCommon calls
mThirdPartyUtil->IsThirdPartyChannel(aChannel, aHostURI, &isForeign);
with aChannel == e.g. the channel for the alternate stylesheet in the testcase, and aHostURI... is the URI for that channel! Understandably, the third party util code then declares that we can send samesite cookies, because the host uri matches the channel URI. I don't really see how this is happening yet works fine "normally", ie I'm not sure what webbrowserpersist is doing differently/wrong in how it creates a channel (once it has a loading principal like with this patch).

Thanks for updating this part of the code - I didn't like falling back to using the systemPrincipal within WebBrowserPersist in the first place. One tiny nit, could we call this principal "triggeringPrincipal", because that's what it really is in the end - it's the principal that triggered the load for those cases.
Bonus points for adding an assertion within saveURI: If saveURI gets passed a referrer, the triggeringPrincipal must be a CodebasePrincipal that matches the URI of the referrer. But we could do that in a follow up of course. Thomas is working on referrer policy, maybe I'll just file another bug and have him take a look.

Shouldn't aHostURI be the URI of the document in that case? Or is that only the problem for stylesheets that aHostURI matches the URI of the stylesheet itself? I couldn't find precisely the code where we end up calling |mThirdPartyUtil->IsThirdPartyChannel(aChannel, aHostURI, &isForeign);|, do you have a stacktrace for that? Or can you provide a DXR link? Then I could take another look.
Besides the principal changes here, I suppose that never worked in the first place and most likely we have a bug where aHostURI is the URI of the stylesheet instead of the document.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I think it \*should\* be but it isn't, yeah. The DXR link for the IsTPC channel is:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/681eb7dfa324dd50403c382888929ea8b8b11b00/netwerk/cookie/nsCookieService.cpp#2034-2036>

This would seem to be surprising to me, but I suppose it's possible. Should be easy to test?

Hey Gijs,
I haven't debugged this, but I just started to look at the code and already realized, it's not the mThirdPartyUtil->IsThirdPartyChannel() check within GetCookieStringCommon, but the NS\_IsSameSiteForeign() [0] that determines whether a request is foreign with respect to same-site cookies.
Now, NS\_IsSameSiteForeign() only does special things for TYPE\_DOCUMENT and TYPE\_SUBDOCUMENT [1], but not for TYPE\_OTHER. Question is, the channel we create within nsWebBrowserPersist::SaveURIInternal is that only for loads of TYPE\_DOCUMENT, right? If so, then I guess we could change the type from TYPE\_OTHER to TYPE\_DOCUMENT and presumably NS\_IsSameSiteForeign() returns the correct result then.
What do you think?

SaveURIInternal gets used both for the actual document and for anything required by the document. In this case the problematic request that has cookies is for a stylesheet <link> element, so I would think that a non-document type is correct... and I'd expect aHostURI to be the document URI, with the channel using the <link> element's URI, and thus those 2 not matching...Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) â†’ needinfo?(ckerschb)

It took me a while to page all of that stuff back in. Here is the info you were looking for:
1) Really the information whether a channel is third party or not does not 'really' depend on the provided HostURI, but is computed from the loadinfo. In particular, the URI of the loadingPrincipal (which refelcts the actual hostURI) is compared to the channelURI within IsThirdPartyChannel here [1].
2) What you pointed out in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - SameSite Cookies leakage via \"Save Page As...\"") however does not really make sense to me, we are passing mURI as the hostURI to GetCookieStringFromHttp() within the HttpBaseChannel [2]. Please note that channel::GetURI() also return mURI, so the hostURI and the channelURI are always identical. In my opinion there is a bug here and we should pass mDocumentURI instead of mURI within HttpBaseChannel [2].
Honza (I guess he is out) or Valentin, what do you think regarding point (2) here?

I think you're right. Even in the IDL it's specified that first argument is supposed to be the URI of the document.

Sorry to interrupt again but the issue doesn't seem to affect only those 4 tags, rather all tags. It's hard to reproduce consistently. The attached HTML should trigger requests for all tags when saved. Please refer to reproduction steps given in my initial report.

So the next question I'm wondering about is... why isn't this broken all the time? i.e. step 4 in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - SameSite Cookies leakage via \"Save Page As...\"") is also what I see - when the page is loaded without using 'save page as' the correct cookies are sent. But the URLs should be the same, right? (Unfortunately I don't have a build to hand so I can't easily check at the moment - will try to do this later today or tomorrow if nobody else gets there before me...)

As usual the answer to seemingly confusing states is more mundane than one might expect.
First off, the reason we block cookies in the normal pageload case isn't the checks referenced here so far, but these:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/681eb7dfa324dd50403c382888929ea8b8b11b00/dom/base/ThirdPartyUtil.cpp#226-235>
copy-paste for convenience:
if (!doForce) {
if (nsCOMPtr<nsILoadInfo> loadInfo = aChannel->GetLoadInfo()) {
parentIsThird = loadInfo->GetIsInThirdPartyContext();
if (!parentIsThird &&
loadInfo->GetExternalContentPolicyType() != nsIContentPolicy::TYPE\_DOCUMENT) {
// Check if the channel itself is third-party to its own requestor.
// Unforunately, we have to go through the loading principal.
nsCOMPtr<nsIURI> parentURI;
loadInfo->LoadingPrincipal()->GetURI(getter\_AddRefs(parentURI));
rv = IsThirdPartyInternal(channelDomain, parentURI, &parentIsThird);
if (NS\_FAILED(rv))
return rv;
}
... and then we return true (for "is this a third party channel") if parentIsThird is true.
Now, the reason this doesn't help with 'save as' is also trivial, it turns out - doForce is true, so we skip this check.
Why? Well, nsWebBrowserPersist code has had this flag since [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=437174](/show_bug.cgi?id=437174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disabling 3rd party cookies breaks sending cookies for channels with no docshell") got fixed (so that people could use the "disable third party cookies" pref and still get cookies in background requests, ie requests without a window), 9 years ago, and since then we've not really updated this stuff...
The last few comments seem to suggest this flag was no longer necessary a few months later. :-\
In any case, I would expect our new principal work to mean that you shouldn't need a docshell for us to make the correct third party cookie decisions, and clearly here the flag is messing with the desired outcome. I'll experiment with fixing this, rather than fixing the mURI/mDocumentURI confusion in the cookie code (which I expect has more fallout - there's not a lot of in-tree usage of the THIRD\_PARTY\_FORCE\_ALLOW flag, it looks like.

This turns out to \*also\* not be trivial to just get rid of this flag everywhere, because we use a system principal for some of these loads, and the third party cookie code tries to get a URI off it, which fails and therefore leaves the cookie code deciding this is a third-party load (safe defaults) and doesn't send cookies (if you disable third party cookies, per [bug 437174](/show_bug.cgi?id=437174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disabling 3rd party cookies breaks sending cookies for channels with no docshell")). I tested this with the InstallTrigger code by uploading a self-hosted add-on on AMO and disabling 3rd party cookies, and then manually running InstallTrigger.install() fails. It seems it'd need to have its principal fixed, too, in order for that to work.
The original rationale here (cf. [bug 437174 comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=437174#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disabling 3rd party cookies breaks sending cookies for channels with no docshell") and further, [bug 421494](/show_bug.cgi?id=421494 "RESOLVED FIXED - reimplement third party cookie blocking")) seems to also include the idea that system loads (sometimes from add-ons) can't be trusted to always send third party cookies. I don't know how that works these days, I don't see any webextension-related code using this flag... It's also interesting that we made the default behavior break all cookies for privileged requests, but privileged requests can work around with a flag (which add-ons could of course also use if they wanted...) which then results in \*all\* cookies being sent, even the ones it really shouldn't send. Feels like the cure is worse than the disease. :-(
Thankfully, favicons (which is a case that's cited repeatedly in the discussion about sending samesite cookies) is being fixed in [bug 1453751](/show_bug.cgi?id=1453751 "RESOLVED FIXED - Favicons should only be loaded once"). So with that, I think the "force cookies" flag should be kill-able.
In any case... hopefully with the fixes in this patch I can ensure that we pass a non-system-principal in all the browser callsites of webbrowserpersist, and get rid of the flag there. Once patches in this bug are finished, reviewed and landed, I'll file a follow-up bug to get the cookie service to use mDocumentURI, and a follow-up bug to kill off this footgun flag - pretty sure we can just pass better principals instead of system principal in the other callsites eventually, and then we can kill the flag.

Thanks Gijs, that sounds like a good path forward to me. It's still surprising to me that using mURI instead of mDocumentURI has been there for so many years.

Backed out for orange in any tests that touched lightweight themes (forgot to update LWTManager which calls nsIWebBrowserPersist.saveURI() ) as well as browser\_jsonview\_save\_json.js (which ended up trying to use a null principal in the parent for a blob URI created in the child for that null principal), and clean-up errors from the new tests that were windows only and seemed to be a race condition with deleting the temporarily-saved file created by the test. Fixed, pushed to try ( <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=1e4b3c5f27825008069bf58cd1e6d96db6e01c64> - green, except for the mochitest-plain-1 chunks that are from pre-existing orange from another cset on inbound - forgot to rebase onto m-c for the trypush).

Yeah, there was enough fallout (that should be fixed now...) which didn't trigger any unittest failures, and it's a big enough patch, that I'd be pretty wary of uplifting this, esp. given it's sec-low.
I could be convinced about taking a roll-up of all of this on ESR as a correctness fix once this has made it to release without incidents. I \*think\* I set the flags right for this, let me know if you need anything else for that.

Hello,
I'm the QA assigned to verify this issue and I've encountered some difficulties when trying to test it. I've followed the steps from the description but I don't have any information written in the request.log file even though I've made the file writable.
Could you please provide some extra information regarding the STR or can you aid into verifying the fix?Flags: needinfo?(prakashsharma97)

Hi,
I'm not sure why it wouldn't work. Are you using same Firefox that I and others used? If not, probably, it's already fixed.
Or can you please check your server log for any errors? Or you can also use requestbin (<https://requestbin.fullcontact.com/>) to log requests and see if it gets the cookies or receives any requests at all.
Let me know if you need any further help.
Thanks,
PrakashFlags: needinfo?(prakashsharma97)

Hm. Let's wait for now. Note that the dep tree of this bug is significant, we'd want to land this + [bug 1473509](/show_bug.cgi?id=1473509 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in InvalidArrayIndex_CRASH | nsTArray_Impl<T>::operator[] | nsWebBrowserPersist::SerializeNextFile") + [bug 1473507](/show_bug.cgi?id=1473507 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in nsILoadInfo::GetOriginAttributes") + [bug 1487263](/show_bug.cgi?id=1487263 "VERIFIED FIXED - [macOS] Drag and drop images saves 0kb file")Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)QA Contact: ckerschb

Hi 1lastBr3ath,
We didn't managed to reproduce this issue (in order to confirm if this is fixed or not). Could you help us by confirming that this is fixed using Firefox beta 63 ?
Thank you!Flags: needinfo?(prakashsharma97)

I'd rather let this wait for the next major ESR. Unless someone wants to argue strongly for taking all these patches from here and the ones mentioned in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - SameSite Cookies leakage via \"Save Page As...\"") for ESR 60.4.0.

Indeed, though I now think it's sufficiently clear that though the dialog in question was broken earlier by this bug (which is/was filed and fixed in [bug 1519732](/show_bug.cgi?id=1519732 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dragging a photo onto an address book card doesn't work any more in TB 65 and trunk")), the new incarnation was not in fact a regression from this bug, so I'm going to remove the newer bug after all. :-)

# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

SameSite cookies, bypass mixed content warnings, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-12388](/security/CVE-2018-12388), [CVE-2018-12390](/security/CVE-2018-12390), [CVE-2018-12392](/security/CVE-2018-12392), [CVE-2018-12393](/security/CVE-2018-12393),

[CVE-2018-12398](/security/CVE-2018-12398), [CVE-2018-12399](/security/CVE-2018-12399), [CVE-2018-12401](/security/CVE-2018-12401), [CVE-2018-12402](/security/CVE-2018-12402),

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))
