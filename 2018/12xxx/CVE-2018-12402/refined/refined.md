Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `WebBrowserPersist` component of Firefox using incorrect origin context when saving resources. Specifically, when saving a webpage with the "Save Page As..." function, sub-resources are loaded without the correct origin information, which causes a SameSite cookie leakage and allows access to otherwise restricted resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Origin Handling:** The `WebBrowserPersist` code fails to use the correct origin context for resources being saved. Sub-resources inherit the origin of the top-level document being saved, which is incorrect.
- **SameSite Cookie Leakage:**  Due to the incorrect origin, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests during "Save Page As...", potentially leaking sensitive cookies.
- **Access to Restricted Resources:**  A malicious page can use this to load sub-resources that are normally not accessible due to cross-origin restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft (NTLM hash):** A malicious page could force the victim's browser to authenticate to an SMB share and leak their Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources from a malicious SMB server. This would happen by tricking the user into saving the page.
- **Data Leakage:**  The vulnerability can lead to SameSite cookie leakage allowing a malicious page to potentially recover the victim's cookie data.
- **Incorrect Resource Saving:** Due to leaking cookies, a website may save the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:**  An attacker would host a malicious web page with embedded resources that trigger the vulnerability when saved by the victim.
- **"Save Page As..." Functionality:**  The victim must use the "Save Page As..." feature of the browser to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a web page with malicious content, or be able to inject such content into a website the victim is visiting.
-  The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim for NTLM theft, but must have a reachable SMB server

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
- The bug report (bug 1447087) associated with this CVE shows that it could be used to perform SMB relay attacks where user credentials would be exposed when trying to save a page, rather than when opening the saved page as described in bug 332676
-  This vulnerability was not triggered in the normal browsing scenario because the third-party cookie check was skipped for the "Save Page As..." feature due to the `THIRD_PARTY_FORCE_ALLOW` flag set to true.
- The fix involved correcting the principal handling in `WebBrowserPersist`, ensuring the correct origin context was used for sub-resource loads and removing the flag mentioned above, which was no longer needed.

**Note:**
The information in the provided documents indicates that the original bug report (bug 1447087) was initially classified as `sec-low` but later reclassified as `sec-moderate`.  It also highlights that this bug is related to multiple other bugs with similar issues and that the `mURI` parameter in `GetCookieStringFromHttp` was incorrect. The fix addressed the underlying cause of the vulnerability which was primarily due to incorrect principal handling.
