- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Whale Browser does not display the URL in the address bar when visiting a non-HTTP page, only the page title.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The browser's address bar fails to display the URL of non-HTTP pages, leading to a potential spoofing issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can display a malicious web page while presenting a fake domain name in the address bar (via a misleading page title). This could lead to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.
- **Attack vectors:** Visiting a non-HTTP web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to host a malicious web page on a non-HTTP protocol (e.g., `file://`, `data://`). They also need to be able to entice a user to visit this page.
