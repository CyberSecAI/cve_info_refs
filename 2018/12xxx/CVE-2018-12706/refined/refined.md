Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12706

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. This occurs when the router's firmware attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The router is vulnerable to a buffer overflow via a long `Authorization` HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Triggering the buffer overflow causes the router to restart.
- After the restart, the web interface becomes faulty, displaying graphical issues. This results in a denial of service and prevents proper configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the router's web interface.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by providing an overly long string in the `Authorization` header of an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router.
- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the router.
- The attacker needs to intercept the normal web traffic to the router using a tool like Burp Suite to modify the `Authorization` header.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication credentials since the overflow is triggered when the `Authorization` header is parsed.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves sending an HTTP request to the router's web interface, specifically targeting the "General Setup" -> "Wireless" -> "Basic Settings" page.
- The attacker intercepts this request using Burp Suite.
- The exploit is triggered by adding a string of 500 "0" characters after the `Authorization Basic` string in the HTTP header.
