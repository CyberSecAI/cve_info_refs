The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MaeloStore CMS version 1.5.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The website does not properly filter user-supplied input in the "Telephone" field within the website settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Telephone" field.
- When a user views the affected page (the homepage in the example), the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
- The vulnerability is persistent as the injected payload is stored in the database and executed every time the page is visited.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the admin panel of the MaeloStore CMS.
- The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript payload into the "Telephone" field under Website settings.
- When a user visits the homepage of the website, the stored payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of the MaeloStore CMS.
- They must be able to navigate to the Website settings page and modify the "Telephone" field.
