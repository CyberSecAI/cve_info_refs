```
1.  **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application discloses sensitive information by accessing the `/dashboard/deposit` path without proper authorization or access controls.
2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability. The application reveals sensitive configuration details.
3.  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive database credentials (username, password, database name), application keys, and mail server credentials. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
4.  **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the specific vulnerable path (`/dashboard/deposit`).
5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No authentication or prior access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
