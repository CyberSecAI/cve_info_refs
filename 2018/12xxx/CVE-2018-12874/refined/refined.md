Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read within the JP2KLib.dll library, a JPEG2000 parser used by Adobe Acrobat and Reader. The root cause is related to how the library handles malformed or crafted JPEG2000 image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The software reads data beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer, which can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability, including data from memory that is outside of the intended buffer.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the primary impact is information disclosure, the vulnerability could be part of a chain of exploits that may lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves specially crafted JPEG2000 files.
- An attacker could embed a malicious JPEG2000 file into a PDF document or trick the user into opening a standalone malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted JPEG2000 file that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
- The attacker needs to deliver this malicious file to a user of Adobe Acrobat or Reader. This could be achieved through phishing attacks, malicious websites, or other means.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, a technique of providing malformed or random data to software to find potential bugs.
- The affected versions include Acrobat and Reader DC, 2017, and Classic 2015 tracks.
- The vulnerability was addressed by Adobe in security updates released on October 1, 2018.

The provided research paper goes into great detail about the fuzzing process used to find this vulnerability, including reverse engineering of the JP2KLib.dll and the development of a harness for the fuzzer.
