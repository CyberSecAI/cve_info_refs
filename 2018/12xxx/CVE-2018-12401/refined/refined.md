Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12401:

**CVE Description:**
>Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Firefox parses certain special resource URIs (like `about:`) when they include optional parameters after a `?`. The `about:` protocol handler doesn't properly strip the ref and query parts, leading to unexpected values being passed to the Quota Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect URI Parsing:** The core issue is that the `about:` protocol URI parsing doesn't strip the query parameters like other protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS do.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The Quota Manager does not validate or handle the extra query parameters and ref in the URI correctly which leads to an assertion failure.
- **Denial of Service:** When a special URI with an additional query parameter is loaded in a vulnerable version of Firefox, it results in a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the browser to crash by loading a specially crafted URL, leading to a DoS condition.
- **No Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution, it only causes the browser to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links:** An attacker could embed a specially crafted `about:` URI, with optional parameters, into a webpage or trick a user into opening one directly.
- **User Interaction (Limited):** While the original report mentioned `about:home` was linkable from web content, it was later clarified that this is no longer the case. So while user interaction is required, the attacker must still find a way to get the user to visit the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of this parsing issue and the specific way to craft such URLs to trigger the crash.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Link:** The attacker needs a platform (website, email, chat, etc.) to get a user to visit a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported with a reference to "memory corruption" but was determined to be just a crash.
- The fix implemented was to strip ref and query parts from `about:` URIs to match how other standard protocols like HTTP/HTTPS are handled.
- The issue was present in Firefox versions prior to 63 and addressed in version 63 and later.
- The fix required code changes to ensure about URIs are processed correctly in the Quota Manager.
