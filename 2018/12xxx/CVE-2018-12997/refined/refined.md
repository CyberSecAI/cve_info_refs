Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12997:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Incorrect Access Control** in the `FailOverHelperServlet` within multiple Zoho ManageEngine products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The `FailOverHelperServlet` allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files on the web server.
*   The servlet is vulnerable because it doesn't properly restrict access to the `copyfile` operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of:
    *   Configuration files (e.g., `web.xml`)
    *   Source code
    *   Credentials
    *   Other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable servlet endpoint.
*   The request includes the `operation=copyfile&fileName=` parameters, specifying the path to the file to be read.
*   The attack is performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Zoho ManageEngine product.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP POST requests.

**Vulnerable Products:**

*   Netflow Analyzer (before build 123137)
*   Network Configuration Manager (before build 123128)
*   OpManager (before build 123148)
*   OpUtils (before build 123161)
*   Firewall Analyzer (before build 123147)

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is: `/servlet/com.adventnet.me.opmanager.servlet.FailOverHelperServlet`
*   The specific operation is triggered by the parameter `operation=copyfile`
*   The file to be read is specified in `fileName=path/to/file`
*   Example request:
    ```
    POST /servlet/com.adventnet.me.opmanager.servlet.FailOverHelperServlet?operation=copyfile&fileName=WEB-INF/web.xml HTTP/1.1
    Host: <target_ip>:<port>
    Accept: */*
    Accept-Language: en
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)
    Connection: close
    Content-Length: 0
    ```
    The "xx" in the original exploit is not necessary, and the body can be empty.
