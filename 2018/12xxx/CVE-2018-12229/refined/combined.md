## Description

[![@asmecher](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200411?v=4&size=48)](/asmecher)[asmecher](https://github.com/asmecher)opened [on Jun 11, 2018](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/3785#issue-331308142)

The `$authors` variable in `templates/frontend/pages/search.tpl` is not escaped. This permits a [reflected (non-persistent) XSS attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_%28OTG-INPVAL-001%29).

Instructions to patch are here: [#3785 (comment)](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/3785#issuecomment-396353840)

See also the notes there about affected theme plugins.

Affects OJS 3.0.0 to 3.1.1-1 (inclusive).

# [OJS 3.1.1-2 and OMP 3.1.1-3 Released](/t/ojs-3-1-1-2-and-omp-3-1-1-3-released/45937)

PKP announces the release of OJS 3.1.1-2 and OMP 3.1.1-3.

These are bugfix releases, notably correcting a reflected XSS vulnerability:

* OMP 1.2.0 to 3.1.1-2: [Issue #3805](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/3805)
* OJS 3.0.0 to 3.1.1-1: [Issue #3785](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/3785) (also Bootstrap and Health Sciences themes)

This type of vulnerability requires some social engineering to take advantage of, and runs client-side, so does not present a high risk. However, it is worth correcting if you’re running an affected release (and we always recommend staying up to date). If you are unable to upgrade to the latest release, there are patch instructions at the links above.

To download OJS 3.1.1-2, and for information on upgrading from previous releases, please see <http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_download>

To download OMP 3.1.1-3, and for information on upgrading from previous releases, please see <http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp_download>

See [PKP Applications and Security](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/pkp-applications-and-security/27991) for general information on security.

Thanks to Metamorfosec for discovery & reporting of the XSS issues.

### Research on research

PKP is truly a Research and Development (R&D) initiative. It has a history of investigating vital scholarly communication issues through data science, policy analysis, historical inquiry, economic modeling, activist legal studies, and other methods. This probing and poking works in concert with PKP’s software development, as well as its hosting and other services, to raise the standards for what scholars and the public can expect from research publications and preprints.

### Join us in advancing open access and open science

PKP benefits from a wide array of contributors. Here’s a chance to develop, support, and research ways of increasing the public and scholarly qualities of journals, books, and preprints.

# [XSS vulnerability alert](/t/xss-vulnerability-alert/45938)

Hi all,

We’ve recently released OJS 3.1.1-2 and OMP 3.1.1-3, and these releases contain a fix for a reflected XSS vulnerability. See [OJS 3.1.1-2 and OMP 3.1.1-3 Released](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/ojs-3-1-1-2-and-omp-3-1-1-3-released) for details.

This is not a critical vulnerability but I do recommend patching or upgrading. Details at the link above.

Regards,

Alec Smecher
