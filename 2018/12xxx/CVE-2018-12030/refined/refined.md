Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12030:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-provided data in the profile settings page of Chevereto Free version 1.0.12. Specifically, the `name` and `bio` fields are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** In the `name` field, a crafted payload is reflected back to the user but is not persistent. The payload is triggered when the user hovers the cursor over the name element.
- **Stored XSS:** In the `bio` field, a crafted payload is stored in the database and triggered when the user navigates back to the settings page. This payload persists and triggers each time the page is loaded.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The reflected XSS vulnerability has a limited impact as it is not persistent and can't be used to inject persistent malicious scripts, though it may be used to redirect users or conduct other malicious behavior.
- The stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially steal the session cookie of an administrator. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application and perform actions with administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The attacker must trick a user into entering the specific XSS payload in the name field and hover over their name on the settings page.
- **Stored XSS:** The attacker must be authenticated and can enter an XSS payload within the bio field on the user profile settings page.  When the user revisits the page, the stored payload will trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the Chevereto Free application.
- For both vulnerabilities the attacker needs to be a logged in user.
- For the reflected XSS, the attacker needs to trick the victim into triggering the payload through the name field.
- For the stored XSS, the attacker needs to manipulate the bio field of the victim's user profile in the Chevereto application.
