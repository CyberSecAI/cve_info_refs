* ## [Being reliable gets you far](https://edricteo.com/reliable)

  September 2024

  Reliability is underrated. We don’t talk about it enough, yet it’s one of the most valuable traits a person can have. It’s not just about doing good work—it’s about showing up, following through, and keeping others informed. People don’t realize how much trust hinges on something as basic as answering an email when you said you would.

  Think about it: why do we trust some people more than others? Often, it’s not because they’re smarter or more talented. It’s because they’re dependable. They do what they say they’ll do. When they hit roadblocks, they don’t disappear—they give you updates. Even a simple “I’m waiting on this” makes a difference. It signals that they haven’t forgotten and that they’re on it.

  This is why [Charlie Munger’s advice—“Invert, always invert”](https://fs.blog/inversion/)—is so useful. To understand what makes someone reliable, think about what makes someone unreliable. The flakiness of not getting back to you. The awkward silence after a missed promise. These aren’t just small annoyances; they erode trust. And trust, once lost, is hard to rebuild.

  Reliability isn’t a single heroic act. It’s a habit. And like most habits, it compounds. Each time you show up and follow through, you’re making a deposit in what you might call a “trust bank.” Over time, the balance grows, and in moments of crisis, people know they can count on you. That’s when reliability becomes priceless.

  The interesting thing is that reliability extends beyond work. It shapes relationships, friendships, and partnerships. No one says it explicitly, but when you’re reliable, people value you more. They want you on their team. They want you in their life.

  If I had to choose one trait in someone—just one—it would be reliability. Because reliable people are the ones who get things done, and they’re the ones you can build something with.

* ## [Words](https://edricteo.com/words)

  September 2024

  I often wonder how humans as a species, managed to thrive. After all, we’re made of the same basic atoms as every other living organism. So, what makes us different?

  The fact that you’re reading and understanding this very sentence is mind-boggling. These are just letters on a screen, but when arranged with care, they convey meaning. And on the receiving end, you can somehow make sense of them.

  The book [*Sapiens*](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/) helped answer some of my questions about this. The author explores how humans evolved the ability to communicate, make plans, and execute them. This capability, more than anything, has allowed us to dominate.

  But here’s something even more interesting: how do we keep discovering new words?

  Our lexicon expands as we’re exposed to new sources—friends, colleagues, or even social media (“skibidi,” “Ohio,” or “gyaat” as of writing this). Every generation invents its own language, leaving the older generation often struggling to keep up. Why? Probably because the older generation tends to stick to their familiar ways of engaging with the world. Eventually, they lose touch with the evolving language.

  Which brings us to the unknown-unknowns: How do we know what we don’t know?

  Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is a good tool to address this. I once found myself looking at closed terrariums but didn’t know anything about springtails – the tiny creatures that help maintain the ecosystem. ChatGPT pointed me in the right direction of springtail care and now I have a springtail culture of my own.

  |  |  |
  | --- | --- |

  Words also take on new meaning depending on context. Take the word “spam,” for instance. Most people today think of unwanted emails or calls. [But “Spam” was originally a food product registered in the U.S. in 1937—a blend of “spiced” and “ham”](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=spam). Who would’ve guessed a word that started on a dinner plate would become synonymous with internet junk?

  Context is everything. Stringing words together changes meaning entirely. A good example of this is a [stand-up comedy on the word “ass”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P0Z1yq-2FQ) where the humor hinges on how language and context collide.

  Even after diving deeper into how language works, it still amazes me how I’ve managed to learn these individual words, string them together, and communicate with you.

  p.s. Just like telephones, language is a great example of network effects. Each additional user strengthens the language (by making it more useful for communication), which encourages new adopters, which in turn strengthen the language further.

* ## [Attention – The Overlooked Asset](https://edricteo.com/attention)

  July 2024

  We often hear that time and energy are our most valuable assets. This idea has been repeated so often that it’s become accepted wisdom. And there’s truth to it – both are finite resources that we can’t replenish. But I’ve come to believe there’s a third asset, equally important yet far less discussed: attention.

  Time, energy, and attention each play a distinct role in our lives. Time passes regardless of our efforts; it’s the backdrop against which all else unfolds. Energy is what we expend to accomplish tasks, whether mental or physical. But attention – attention is the lens through which we focus our time and energy.

  Consider how we typically think about these resources. We’re acutely aware when someone wastes our time or depletes our energy. But how often do we consider the cost of misplaced attention? It’s a subtle drain, one that we rarely notice in the moment.

  The reason attention often goes unmentioned is that it’s perceived as cheap. Advertisers capture it for fractions of a cent. Content creators vie for it with increasingly sensational headlines. We’ve become so accustomed to giving away our attention that we’ve forgotten its value.

  But attention is far from cheap. It’s the captain of our personal ship, setting the course for where we direct our time and energy. A small shift in attention, like a tiny adjustment in a golf swing, can lead to dramatically different outcomes over time.

  This oversight has real consequences. We carefully budget our time and conserve our energy, but we let our attention scatter to the winds. We end up investing thousands of hours in pursuits that, in retrospect, added little value to our lives. All because we failed to guard our attention as zealously as we guard our time and energy.

  The phrase “losing focus” is particularly telling. It implies that our attention naturally wanders, that losing it is inevitable. But this framing absolves us of responsibility. We don’t lose focus so much as relinquish it, often to carefully engineered distractions.

  *“The modern vampire doesn’t suck your blood; it sucks your attention.”*

  In our hyper-connected world, reclaiming our attention has become crucial. Our smartphones – those sleek, pocket-sized supercomputers – are weapons of mass distraction. Every notification, every app, is designed to capture and hold our attention. And they’re very good at it.

  So how do we reclaim this vital resource? One approach is to be more deliberate about our information diet. Just as we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with, our thoughts and actions are shaped by the content we consume. Curating this intake more carefully can have profound effects.

  Another strategy is to seek out evergreen knowledge – information that remains valuable over time. Much of what we consume – news articles, social media posts, ephemeral trends – has a short half-life. Its relevance decays rapidly. But there are topics – health, relationships, fundamental principles of science and philosophy – that compound in value the more we engage with them.

  The intention behind our consumption matters too. It’s easy to fall into passive consumption, letting information wash over us without truly engaging. But true learning, true growth, requires active engagement. It’s the difference between having a podcast on in the background while doing chores and sitting down to listen attentively, taking notes, and reflecting on what you’ve heard.

  I’ve experimented with various approaches to managing my attention. One simple but effective method was deactivating my social media accounts for a week. The world, unsurprisingly, continued to turn. Most people, absorbed in their own digital ecosystems, didn’t even notice my absence.

  Another tactic I’ve found useful is keeping my phone in “Focus” mode by default, allowing only calls to come through. In an age where most communication happens via text or messaging apps, a phone call usually signifies something important. This simple change has dramatically reduced the number of times my attention is needlessly diverted throughout the day.

  The goal isn’t to completely eliminate distractions or to never engage in leisure activities. Rather, it’s to be more intentional about where we direct our attention. It’s about recognizing that every piece of content we consume, every activity we engage in, comes with an opportunity cost. When we say yes to watching a video or scrolling through a feed, we’re saying no to countless other potential uses of that time and mental energy.

  In business, there’s a concept of seeking products or services with near-zero marginal cost of duplication. Information often fits this model – once created, it can be distributed to millions at little additional cost. But as consumers of information, we need to consider a different cost: the cost of consumption. Our attention is the price we pay, and it’s a currency we can’t afford to spend frivolously.

  It’s worth asking: How will the time you’ve spent reading this benefit you in the long run? Will the ideas here compound, influencing your future decisions about how you allocate your attention? Or will they fade, just another fleeting piece of content in the endless stream?

  The answer, of course, depends on what you do next. Will you reflect on these ideas, apply them, test them against your own experience? Or will you simply move on to the next item in your feed?

  The choice – and the precious resource of your attention – is yours.

## [CVE-2018-12030] Chevereto Free – XSS Vulnerability in Version 1.0.12

June 2018

[CVE-2018-12030] Chevereto Free – XSS Vulnerability in Version 1.0.12

---

Product Information:

Software: Chevereto Free

Tested Version: 1.0.12, released 23.04.2018

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)

Description: Chevereto Free has the same look and feels as our paid edition and it includes all the essential image hosting functionalities. Install it in seconds, and fall in love in minutes. (copied from <https://chevereto.com/free>)

---

Important note:

Chevereto Free is a fork of Chevereto (the paid version). This advisory focuses solely only on the Free version and does not in any way refer to Chevereto (the paid version).

---

Vulnerability description:

There are two XSS vulnerabilities in Chevereto Free version 1.0.12.

Both are located at /chevereto/settings/profile.

Navigate as a regular user to /chevereto/settings/profile.

1) Authenticated Reflected XSS

Enter **`a" onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)" "`** in the name field and click Save changes. The payload should not be seen upon saving.

Hover the cursor over the name element and the payload should trigger. Due to the implementation, this does not persist. Subsequent attempts of the payload will be evaluated as a value instead.

Affected parameter: name

2) Authenticated Stored XSS

Enter **`a"></textarea><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>`** in the biofield and click Save changes.

Navigate away from the current page and return to /chevereto/settings/profile. The payload should trigger.

Affected parameter: bio

---

Impact:

The first XSS vulnerability does not have any attack scenario since the payload is rendered as value for subsequent attempts.

An attacker could potentially use the second XSS vulnerability to steal the cookie of an administrator.
