Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE:** The content relates to a reported vulnerability in the `pbc` repository, specifically a "global-buffer-overflow in calc_hash src/map.c:35", which is likely to be related to CVE-2018-12915, as per the issue title.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a global buffer overflow in the `calc_hash` function located in `src/map.c` at line 35.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting the buffer overflow can result in memory corruption, leading to potential consequences such as:
    * Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application
    * Arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical program data or control flow.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `calc_hash` function which is presumably called with a malicious or specially crafted input that leads to the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the program that would trigger the `calc_hash` function. The required capabilities are not detailed within this context, however they would need to have enough control over data passed to the function to cause an overflow.
