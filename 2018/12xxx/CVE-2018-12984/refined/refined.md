**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an authentication bypass vulnerability present in the login mechanism of hycus CMS version 1.0.4.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability or a logic flaw in the authentication process, allowing an attacker to bypass the login.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to the application's admin panel. This could lead to complete compromise of the application, modification or deletion of data, or further attacks against the server.

**Attack vectors:**
