| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1104076#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-08-07 15:14:39 UTC  ``` additional report from ebx@riseup.net  I was just looking at the code that handles checking for verified siblings and there's a fairly trivial authentication bypass that makes it all but a moot point and would allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit the previous two vulnerabilities.  The code checks both the hostname _and_ the ip address of the incoming request, and only aborts the request if _both_ of them are not present in the `acceptRegistrationSharing` option in the configuration file (more technically the `acceptedProviders` hash). All well and great to check the IP address (even though I could spoof that and still exploit the XXE for DOS or the SQLi for command execution), but the hostname check is only checking for the "Host" HTTP header and is very easily spoofed:  <https://github.com/SUSE/smt/blob/SMT12/www/perl-lib/SMT/RegistrationSharing.pm#L644>  <https://github.com/SUSE/smt/blob/SMT12/www/perl-lib/SMT/RegistrationSharing.pm#L670>  As an example, I was able to easily bypass my own setup with this command: curl --header "Host: 127.0.0.1" -X POST -d @readfile.xml "http://<smt_url>/center/regsvc?command=shareregistration&lang=en-US&version=1.0"  I think it would be pretty easy for an attacker to guess a host that was allowed (or just keep trying as many as possible until they get lucky). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1104076#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2018-08-09 06:13:18 UTC  ``` I have assigned CVE-2018-12472 to this issue. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1104076#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2018-08-16 15:26:58 UTC  ``` SUSE would like to thank Jake Miller for reporting these issues to us. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1104076#c13)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-27 12:49:04 UTC  ``` updates released ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1104076#c14)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-09-27 16:11:28 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:2898-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has 6 fixes is now available.
