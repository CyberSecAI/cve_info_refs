## Security Advisories

Arista Networks is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security across our product portfolio. Leveraging extensive testing and monitoring of vulnerabilities to isolate and neutralize threats early, Arista's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) provides global coverage for public reporting of possible security vulnerabilities across the product portfolio.

The PSIRT team monitors industry-wide vulnerability reporting as well as providing a single point of contact for customers and interested third parties to investigate and identify potential threats. The PSIRT team also works to communicate these issues back to the user community in a timely manner.

Arista's approach to vulnerability management and links to best practice guidelines can be found [here](/support/product-documentation/vulnerability-management-process).

For technical assistance with workarounds and hotfix installations recommended in security advisories, please contact the Arista Support team at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..

Report security vulnerabilities found in Arista products to the PSIRT team via This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.. It is recommended to use [Arista's PGP key](/assets/data/support/Arista_Networks_PSIRT.asc) for secure and private communication directly with the PSIRT team.

Arista PSIRT is happy to work with researchers on discovered vulnerabilities in Arista products, the assignment of CVEs, and timelines for responsible disclosure. If a researcher discovers a new vulnerability they will be acknowledged in the advisory related to the vulnerability. Arista PSIRT is interested in receiving reports on issues affecting features in both Arista code as well as Open Source Software used in Arista products. Security issues found in Open Source Software which do not affect Arista products are out of the scope of Arista and should be referred to the appropriate CNA found [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html#cna_participants).

### PSIRT Advisories

The following advisories and referenced materials are provided on an "as is" basis for use at your own risk. Arista Networks reserves the right to change or update the advisories without notice at any time.

## [Security Advisory 0110](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/21092-security-advisory-0110)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS with BGP Link State configured, BGP peer flap can cause the BGP agent to leak memory. This may result in BGP routing processing being terminated and route flapping.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-9135

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/21092-security-advisory-0110)

## [Security Advisory 0109](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/21086-security-advisory-0109)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS with 802.1X configured, certain conditions may occur where a dynamic ACL is received from the AAA server resulting in only the first line of the ACL being installed after an Accelerated Software Upgrade (ASU) restart.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-8000

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/21086-security-advisory-0109)

## [Security Advisory 0108](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20689-security-advisory-0108)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS with one of the following features configured to redirect IP traffic to a next hop: policy-based routing (PBR), BGP Flowspec, or interface traffic policy -- certain IP traffic such as IPv4 packets with IP options may bypass the feature's set nexthop action and be slow-path forwarded (FIB routed) by the kernel as the packets are trapped to the CPU instead of following the redirect action's destination.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-6437

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20689-security-advisory-0108)

## [Security Advisory 0107](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20650-security-advisory-0107)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS with SNMP configured, if “snmp-server transmit max-size” is configured, under some circumstances a specially crafted packet can cause the snmpd process to leak memory. This may result in the snmpd process being terminated (causing SNMP requests to time out until snmpd is restarted) and memory pressure for other processes on the switch. Increased memory pressure can cause processes other than snmpd to be at risk for unexpected termination as well. This was discovered internally by Arista and we are not aware of any malicious uses of this issue in customer networks.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-7095

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20650-security-advisory-0107)

## [Security Advisory 0106](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20649-security-advisory-0106)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS, a specially crafted packet with incorrect VLAN tag might be copied to CPU, which may cause incorrect control plane behavior related to the packet, such as route flaps, multicast routes learnt, etc. This issue was discovered internally and Arista is not aware of any malicious uses of this issue in customer networks.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-5872

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20649-security-advisory-0106)

## [Security Advisory 0105](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20454-security-advisory-0105)

Multiple vulnerabilities exist for the Arista Edge Threat Management - Arista NG Firewall (NGFW)

The CVE-IDs tracking this issue: CVE-2024-9131, CVE-2024-9132, CVE-2024-9133, CVE-2024-9134, CVE-2024-47517, CVE-2024-47518, CVE-2024-47519, CVE-2024-47520, CVE-2024-9188

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20454-security-advisory-0105)

## [Security Advisory 0104](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20405-security-advisory-0104)

On Arista CloudVision Appliance (CVA) affected releases running on appliances that support hardware disk encryption (DCA-350E-CV only), the disk encryption might not be successfully performed. This results in the disks remaining unsecured and data on them being readable without the passphrase. This vulnerability allows local attackers to remove the unencrypted disk from the affected system, then attach to a different system, and access its data.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-7142

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/20405-security-advisory-0104)

## [Security Advisory 0103](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/19917-security-advisory-0103)

In Arista’s EOS when in 802.1X mode, multi-auth unauthenticated hosts might be allowed access to a switch port if there exists an EAPOL capable device in the fallback VLAN. This issue was discovered internally and Arista is not aware of any malicious uses of this issue in customer networks.

This vulnerability is being tracked by BUG 828435

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/19917-security-advisory-0103)

## [Security Advisory 0102](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/19908-security-advisory-0102)

On affected platforms running Arista EOS with MACsec and egress ACLs configured on the same interfaces, the ACL policies may not be enforced for packets egressing on those ports. This can cause outgoing packets to incorrectly be allowed or denied.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-27891

[Read More](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/19908-security-advisory-0102)

## [Security Advisory 0101](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/19905-security-advisory-0101)

Arista Networks is providing this security update in response to the following publicly disclosed security vulnerability related to the RADIUS protocol. This vulnerability is a result of a design flaw in the RADIUS protocol. It allows a skilled attacker who can read and modify RADIUS packets in the network to forge responses from the RADIUS server to the client. In this way the attacker can cause any user to be authenticated and can give almost any authorization to any user. RADIUS over TLS (RadSec) resolves this vulnerability.

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2024-3596

#### **CVSS v3:** 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

This advisory is to document a security vulnerability identified by Arista Networks that affects CloudVision Portal. Affected CloudVision Portal releases are listed in Table-1 below. This issue is an incorrect permissions vulnerability in which an authenticated user could gain access to sensitive information of other users. A prerequisite to this is the configuration of a remote AAA server.

#### NOTE:

This vulnerability was identified internally by Arista Networks and there have been no external reports of an exploit, as of the date of this notice.

#### **Affected Software Releases:**

| 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018.1   * 2018.1.0 * 2018.1.1 | 2017.2   * 2017.2.0 * 2017.2.1 * 2017.2.2 * 2017.2.3   2017.1   * 2017.1.0 * 2017.1.0.1 * 2017.1.1 * 2017.1.1.1 | 2016.1   * 2016.1.0 * 2016.1.1 * 2016.1.2 * 2016.1.2.1 * 2016.1.2.3 | 2015.1   * 2015.1.1 * 2015.1.2 |

#### **Recommended Action:**

For systems running any affected release of CloudVision Portal, the immediate recommendation is to:

* Follow the recommended mitigation to minimize risk
* Upgrade to a remediated version of CloudVision Portal for resolution

#### **Mitigation:**

Only authenticated users to CloudVision portal that have read or write access to ‘Account Management’ can exploit this vulnerability. The general recommendation is to restrict users assigned to the default ‘network-admin’ role to a trusted subset and for all other roles defined, remove read or write access to ‘Account Management’ using the following steps:

1. Click on Settings
2. In the Account Management tab, chose ‘Roles’ from the drop down menu
3. Ensure that the network-admin/network-operator role only includes a trusted subset of users
   * View the list of users assigned to the network-admin/network-operator role
   * Create a new role that does not have read or write access to User management
4. Review the rest of the role settings and users assigned to each role. In general, users should be restricted to a role that limits read and write access to only the modules they need. In particular, read and write access to the settings modules should be limited to CloudVision Portal administrators.

#### **Resolution:**

This vulnerability is tracked by bug 273526 and is addressed in CloudVision Portal release 2018.1.2. It is recommended to upgrade to the remediated version.
