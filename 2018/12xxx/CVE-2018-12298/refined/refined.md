  "cveId": "CVE-2018-12298",
  "description": "This device runs a containerized “filebrowser” application, which allows authenticated users to interact with assets stored within pre-configured share directories. During our study, we determined that this application is vulnerable to unauthenticated path traversal attacks. These attacks may be used to disclose the contents of arbitrary files within the container including, but not limited to, application source code, configuration files with sensitive keys, and user data. Additionally, this vulnerability may be used to disclose the non-containerized primary application’s source, as these files are included in the container.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Lack of path canonicalization in the filebrowser application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can disclose arbitrary files within the container, including application source code, configuration files with sensitive keys, and user data. It can also be used to disclose the primary application’s source code.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "By crafting a GET request with a path traversal sequence (e.g., `/apps/filebrowser/../../../usr/lib/unicorn/run.py`) to the vulnerable endpoint."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability."
