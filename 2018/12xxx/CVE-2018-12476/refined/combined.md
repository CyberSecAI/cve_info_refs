| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1107944#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-11 07:40:05 UTC  ``` The obs-service-extract_file allows to move extracted files or directories to more or less arbitrary locations like:  - an absolute path like /tmp, /home/$TARGET_USER, /dev/shm - a relative path like ../somewhere  This could be used to prepare attacks in combination with other security leaks or even lead to code execution. When the victims user name is known then e.g. a file could be extracted to /home/$TARGET_USER/.bashrc. Since files in tarballs are extracted with executable bits preserved there is little limit to what can be done. For example an attacker could also write hook scripts into git repositories cloned into the package directory. Also symlinks can be extracted and put into the package directory, allowing preparation of attacks in conjunction with other source services.  Code execution is mostly a client side concern but could hit the server side, too, when enough effort is put into it.  This package has currently no maintainer in OBS so I'm assigning to you Adrian. Please assign to someone suitable. Thank you. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1107944#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-26 09:28:02 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2018-12476 for this ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1107944#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-02-28 01:20:30 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1107944) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/679987> Factory / obs-service-tar_scm ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1107944#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-02-28 11:30:29 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1107944) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/680081> 15.0+42.3 / obs-service-tar_scm ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1107944#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-04 20:56:16 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:0540-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.
