Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12476:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `obs-service-extract_file` service in the Open Build Service (OBS) allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary output file path via the `outfilename` parameter. This permits writing extracted files or directories to locations outside the intended package directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `outfilename` parameter doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the output path, allowing for absolute paths (e.g., `/tmp`, `/home/$TARGET_USER`) and relative paths (e.g., `../somewhere`).
- **Unrestricted File Write:** The service allows writing to arbitrary locations the attacker chooses
- **Preserved Executable Bits:** Files extracted from archives retain their executable permissions, increasing the potential for exploitation.
- **Symlink Creation:** Symlinks can also be extracted into the package directory, creating potential attack vectors in conjunction with other source services

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the system, which can be used to overwrite existing files or create new ones
- **Code Execution:** By exploiting the arbitrary file write vulnerability, an attacker could place malicious code in sensitive locations, such as user's `~/.bashrc` (if the target user is known), or inject scripts into git repositories to be run during build operations, potentially leading to code execution on the client (build machine) or server side.
- **Preparation for Attacks**: By writing files and symlinks to arbitrary places the attacker can perform actions that prepare the ground for other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious package that exploits the `obs-service-extract_file` service.
- The attacker uses a crafted archive or an update mechanism to deploy files with a crafted `outfilename` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify packages that are processed by the `obs-service-extract_file` service.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this.
- Knowing the target username will make the attack easier, but it is not mandatory.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the client side (build machine) mainly.
- The vulnerability can hit the server as well when the attacker puts enough effort.
- This vulnerability was addressed in updates to `obs-service-tar_scm` in multiple SUSE and openSUSE releases.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Matthias Gerstner.
