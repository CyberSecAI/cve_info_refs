Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper output encoding in the Adrenalin HRMS software. User-supplied input is echoed back in the HTML response within JavaScript code without being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. This is due to the failure to sanitize user-controlled input before displaying it within the HTML. Specifically, the `prntDDLCntrlName` and `prntFrmName` parameters in the `ApplicationtEmployeeSearch.aspx` page are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Stealing user cookies and session tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page through DOM manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters (`prntDDLCntrlName` and `prntFrmName`).
*   The attacker would need to trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL. This can be achieved via phishing or other social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable parameters, and then trick a user into visiting the link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameters are `prntDDLCntrlName` and `prntFrmName`
*   The affected page is `ApplicationtEmployeeSearch.aspx`
*   The vulnerable version is Adrenalin HRMS 5.4.0
*   The provided example URL demonstrates how the vulnerability can be triggered using the `prntDDLCntrlName` parameter.
*   The vulnerability was patched on the cloud version of the software on July 2nd, 2018.
