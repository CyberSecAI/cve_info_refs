Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12474:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability lies within the `obs-service-tar_scm` service, which is used within the Open Build Service (OBS) to manage source code archives. It was discovered that the service could be tricked via crafted parameters, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security issues.

**Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied parameters to the `obs-service-tar_scm` service. Several specific issues were identified:

1.  **Local Source Repositories:** The service allowed cloning of local repositories by specifying a local path in the URL parameter (`<param name="url">/home/some/repo</param>`). This allows a user to potentially use a malicious local repo when building a package.
2.  **Arbitrary Output Paths:** By using relative or absolute paths in the `filename` parameter (e.g., `<param name="filename">/tmp/somepkg</param>`), it was possible to escape the intended package directory. This could lead to creation of files in arbitrary locations.
3.  **Symlink Following in `extract`:** The `extract` parameter allowed following symlinks. If a symlink to a sensitive location (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) was present in the source repository, specifying that symlink as the extract parameter resulted in copying the linked file into the package.
4.  **Symlink Following in `subdir`:** Similar to the `extract` parameter, the `subdir` parameter would follow symlinks in the upstream repository. Placing a symlink like `etc -> /etc` would allow arbitrary system files to be packaged in the resulting archive.
5. **Unsanitized obsinfo Parameters:** The name and version parameters within the *.obsinfo files were not sanitized and would allow path components like `/etc/fstab`, potentially leading to renaming of files in sensitive locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** Using absolute or relative paths in the filename parameter allows writing outside the intended package directory.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The `extract` and `subdir` parameters, combined with symlinks, allowed the service to read arbitrary files that the user running the service had access to.
*   **Unintended Local File Access:** The ability to specify a local repository via the URL parameter could allow a user to use a malicious local repo when building a package.
* **Unsanitized Input:** The name and version parameters in the `*.obsinfo` file can be abused to create files in arbitrary locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** Attackers could create files in unintended locations.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers could use symlinks to extract and package sensitive files.
*   **Local Code Execution:** By combining local repository cloning with other exploits, a malicious user may be able to execute arbitrary code on the local build system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Service Parameters:** Attackers could modify the `_service` file to include malicious parameter values.
*   **Malicious Source Repositories:** Attackers could create malicious source repositories with carefully crafted symlinks and then use them as a source.
*   **Malicious obsinfo Files**: Attackers could inject malicious path components into the name and version parameters of an obsinfo file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create or modify the _service file:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the service file.
*   **Ability to create a malicious source repository (or modify an existing one):** This would be needed to exploit the symlink following issues.
*   **Access to the OBS instance:** The attacker must be able to trigger the service to run either on the server or on a local client.
*   **User permissions:** The attacker is limited to the permissions of the user account under which the obs service is executed

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered during a general OBS review.
* The fix for the vulnerability was rolled out in updates for SUSE Linux Enterprise Module for Open Buildservice Development Tools 15 and openSUSE Leap 15.0.
* The fix includes sanitizing the service parameters, and preventing the service from following symbolic links.
* The bug report mentions a warning for local repositories being insufficient, implying there might be a need for additional checks, especially on the server side.
