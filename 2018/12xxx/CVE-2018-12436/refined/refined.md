  "vulnerability_information": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-12436",
    "description": "Versions of wolfSSL prior to 3.15.3 were vulnerable to a Key Extraction Side Channel Attack.",
    "root_cause": "A memory cache side channel attack during ECDSA signature generation could be used to recover the private key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation.",
       "Lack of blinding during ECDSA operations."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with local access to the system could recover the ECDSA private key by observing memory cache access patterns during signature generation.",
     "attack_vector": "Local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires access to the system where the ECDSA key is being used for signing and knowledge of memory cache side-channel attacks.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specific to ECDSA private keys using the fastmath or normal math libraries in wolfSSL. It does not affect users using the single precision math library or ECDSA offloading. The vulnerability could be exploited within a few thousand signatures. The fix involves using a blinding value during ECDSA signing to mitigate the side-channel attack."
