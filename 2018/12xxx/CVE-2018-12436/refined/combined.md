# wolfSSL and ROHNP

- [June 14, 2018June 22, 2018](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssh-and-rohnp/)

wolfSSL is one of over a dozen vendors mentioned in the recent Technical Advisory "ROHNP" by author Ryan Keegan. Versions of wolfSSL prior to 3.15.3 were vulnerable to a Key Extraction Side Channel Attack. wolfSSL v3.15.3 which is protected against these attacks and has other improvements is [available for download](http://wolfssl.com/download) now on our website.

Only wolfSSL users with long term ECDSA private keys using our fastmath or normal math libraries on systems where attackers can get access to the machine using the ECDSA key need to update.  An attacker gaining access to the system could mount a memory cache side channel attack that could recover the key within a few thousand signatures. wolfSSL users that are not using ECDSA private keys, that are using the single precision math library, or that are using ECDSA offloading do not need to update. An update is still recommended however, as it is typically best to run the most up-to-date software versions.

Please contact support@wolfssl.com with any questions.

## [A slice of security for the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.wolfssl.com/a-slice-of-security-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico/)

* [January 17, 2025January 9, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/a-slice-of-security-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico/)

Pretty much everyone knows what a Raspberry Pi board is, a very budget-friendly ARM board which runs Linux. What you might not know is that Raspberry Pi also created a very small, cheap, embedded ARM microcontroller range and development board as well. The board is known as the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html) and the chip is [the RP2040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040).

The RP2040 is a $1 dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller with lots of features and a very well documented SDK. It was followed-up recently with [the RP2350](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2350), which, for a similar price, gets you a dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 / RISC-V microcontroller. The RP2350 can be found on the Pi Pico 2 boards.

**wolfSSL support**

wolfSSL has had basic support for RP2040 for a little while, but with wolfSSL 5.7.6, we have provided improvements to the support. In addition, we have added support for the RP2350.

For both microcontrollers, we have enhanced the performance for RNG. We have integrated support for the PRNG in the Pico SDK for the RP2040 and the TRNG in the RP2350. Both provide performance improvements.

With the RP2350, we have also added support for the RISC-V mode for the cores.

**Benchmark**

What about the numbers? Well, with a RP2350 in ARM mode, clocked at the default 150MHz, these are the numbers you can expect to see from the wolfCrypt Benchmark:

## [wolfSSL FIDO Compliance: Implementing FIDO Authentication Standards with wolfCrypt](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-fido-compliance-implementing-fido-authentication-standards-with-wolfcrypt/)

* [January 15, 2025January 6, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-fido-compliance-implementing-fido-authentication-standards-with-wolfcrypt/)

wolfSSL FIDO Compliance

As organizations move away from traditional password-based authentication, [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/) (Fast Identity Online) has emerged as one of the leading standards for strong authentication. wolfSSL is positioned to support this transition with our robust cryptography library, [wolfCrypt](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt-2/), which implements many of the core algorithms required for FIDO compliance. This blog outlines how wolfSSL can serve as a foundation for FIDO-compliant authentication solutions.

FIDO and Why It Matters

FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance maintains strict standards for cryptographic implementations in authentication systems with a mission to reduce the reliance of passwords. With wolfCrypt implementing most of the FIDO-approved algorithms, this means wolfSSL can provide developers with a compliant cryptographic foundation for their FIDO authentication solutions for both large, web-connected systems as well as embedded microcontrollers.

Existing FIDO-Approved Algorithms

wolfSSL already implements many of the cryptographic algorithms from FIDO’s allowed cryptography list[1], including:

* SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 and SHA3-512
* HMAC capabilities with the allowed hash functions
* HMAC implementation for secure message authentication
* AES-CMAC support for lightweight authentication
* AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
* RSA PSS and PKCS#1 v1.5 signature support
* Ed25519 signatures

The only missing algorithms in wolfSSL are the implementation of ED256, ED256-2, ED512 and ED638.

wolfSSL also meets FIDO’s deterministic random number/bit generator requirements as wolfCrypt is NIST FIPS 140-2/3 compliant which uses NIST SP800-90A HASH\_DRBG as well as NIST SP800-90B compliant entropy generation.

Potential Integration with FIDO2 Applications and Libraries

FIDO2 is the latest authentication standard that enables passwordless and strong two-factor authentication through the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API and Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). With there already being FIDO2 applications on the market wolfSSL can easily be implemented directly or automatically with the compatibility layer or engine/provider OpenSSL replacement. For instance Yubico’s [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2) library which uses OpenSSL could be ported to use wolfCrypt instead.

A wolfSSL employee has also been working on a project that uses 2FA with wolfCrypt on a Raspberry Pi Pico called [Fidelio](https://github.com/danielinux/fidelio).

FIPS 140-3 and FIDO2

Organizations requiring both FIDO2 and FIPS 140-3 compliance can leverage wolfCrypt’s [FIPS 140-3 validated module](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/), which provides CAVP and FIPS validated implementations of essential FIDO algorithms. This dual compliance ensures solutions meet both authentication standards and regulatory requirements.

Looking Forward

Contact us at facts@wolfSSL.com or +1 425 245 8247 for question about comprehensive support for integrating wolfCrypt into your FIDO2 applications, including:

* Technical consultation for implementation
* Documentation and example code
* Integration with hardware security modules
* Optimization for embedded systems
* Custom builds for specific platforms

## [Dilithium Support in wolfCLU](https://www.wolfssl.com/dilithium-support-in-wolfclu/)

* [January 14, 2025January 10, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/dilithium-support-in-wolfclu/)

We have added the Dilithium command to [wolfCLU](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfclu/). Dilithium (referred to as ML-DSA by NIST) is a post-quantam cryptography (PQC) algorithm for signing and verification. This blog post provides an overview of how to use the Dilithium command in wolfCLU.

To use the Dilithium command, you must first build wolfSSL with the appropriate configuration options: `–enable-wolfclu` and `–enable-dilithium`.

**Building wolfSSL:**

```
$ cd wolfssl
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configurte –enable-wolfclu –enable-dilithium
$ make && make check
$ sudo make install

```

Once wolfSSL is built and installed, you can build wolfCLU. No additional macros are required for this step. After installing, you can check wolfssl command version.

**Building wolfCLU:**

```
$ cd wolfclu
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make && make check
$ sudo make install
$ wolfssl -v

```

**Key Generation:**

To generate a Dilithium key pair, use the “-genkey” command. Dilithium supports different security levels (2, 3, and 5) as defined by NIST. You can specify the security level using “-level” and the output filename using “-out”.

```
$ wolfssl -genkey dilithium -level 2 -out dilithium_key -outform der -output keypair

```

**Sign:**

To sign a file with the Dilithium private key, use the “-sign” command. Specify the private key with “-inkey”, the file to be signed with “-in”, and the output signature file with “-out”.

```
$ wolfssl dilithium -sign -inkey dilithium_key.priv -inform der -in test.txt -out signature.sig

```

**Verify:**

To verify a signed file, use the “-verify” command. Provide the public key using “-inkey”, the file to verify with “-in”, and the signature file with “-sigfile”. If the signature is valid, the output will display “Valid Signature”. If not, it will display “Invalid Signature”.

```

## [Renesas RX TSIP with ECDSA and Crypto Callbacks](https://www.wolfssl.com/renesas-rx-tsip-with-ecdsa-and-crypto-callbacks/)

* [January 13, 2025December 31, 2024](https://www.wolfssl.com/renesas-rx-tsip-with-ecdsa-and-crypto-callbacks/)

wolfSSL now has support for Renesas RX TSIP with ECDSA and crypto callbacks. This update provides broader flexibility and security for embedded systems with Renesas RX TSIP. Below is a summary of the key changes and updates that were added in [PR# 7685](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7685):

**Key Changes and Features**

1. **Renesas RX TSIP with ECDSA Support**
   WolfSSL now fully supports ECDSA on Renesas RX TSIP, which adds greater functionality when generating signatures. The update also adds support for raw R+S signatures.
2. **ECC with NO\_ASN**
   You can now use ECC support without ASN.1 encoding by using the configuration:

   ‘./configure –enable-cryptonly –disable-rsa –disable-asn –disable-examples’

   This can decrease the overhead in environments where you don’t need ASN.1 support.
3. **RX TSIP Crypt Configuration Fixes**
   These changes also fixes issues with WOLFSSL\_RENESAS\_TSIP\_CRYPTONLY and NO\_WOLFSSL\_RENESAS\_TSIP\_CRYPT\_HASH macros, allowing for builds to complete smoothly when there is only a requirement for cryptography operations.
4. **Reverted wc\_GenerateSeed Support**
   wc\_GenerateSeed on the RX TSIP was reverted. This ensures compatibility with the updated RNG on RX TSIP.
5. **Updated Client Authentication Key Data**
   Example key data with private key for client authentication has been updated.

**Testing**

These changes were tested using the e2Studio IDE, and tests were verified including client and server examples.

**Conclusion**

These updates extend wolfSSL’s support of the Renesas RX TSIP to include ECDSA and Raw R+S signature support, greatly improving flexibility and optimizing the build for embedded systems. If you have questions about any of the above, please contact us at facts@wolfSSL.com or +1 425 245 8247.

## [wolfSSL Enhances PowerPC Support on Darwin](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-enhances-powerpc-support-on-darwin/)

* [January 10, 2025January 9, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-enhances-powerpc-support-on-darwin/)

At wolfSSL, we are committed to supporting a wide range of platforms and architectures, ensuring that our SSL/TLS library can be used across various environments. One of the platforms we continue to support is PowerPC, both in 32-bit and 64-bit configurations.

The latest updates to our PowerPC support primarily focus on resolving compatibility issues with Darwin (macOS) systems. The recent changes in the pull request https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7931 do not introduce any new features or modify existing functionality. These updates include:

* **PowerPC Macros:** Adjustments ensure compatibility with Darwin, allowing smooth builds on macOS.
* **Assembler Compatibility:** We’ve addressed issues with how registers are prefixed in the Darwin ABI ensuring compatibility with PowerPC systems.

Instead of adding register prefixes via a simple macro, we’ve opted for a more robust approach. This helps prevent potential issues in the future.

If you have questions about any of the above, please contact us at facts@wolfSSL.com or +1 425 245 8247.

## [Extended Key Update for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/extended-key-update-for-transport-layer-security-tls-1-3/)

* [January 9, 2025January 2, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/extended-key-update-for-transport-layer-security-tls-1-3/)

The [Extended Key Update extension for (D)TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-extended-key-update/) is a draft proposal for a new key update mechanism. (D)TLS 1.3 lacks perfect forward secrecy (PFS) for long-lived sessions, leaving them vulnerable to key exfiltration attacks. The proposed Extended Key Update mechanism addresses this by incorporating minimal key exchanges during key updates. This safeguards connections by ensuring that even if session keys are compromised, past and future communications remain confidential.

This extension is ideal for environments where long uninterrupted secure connections are critical. By introducing PFS into key updates without requiring establishing new connections, it enhances security while maintaining availability. Its design also supports hybrid key exchanges, ensuring post-quantum readiness with a fallback to classical cryptography.

wolfSSL strives to provide the best security, and that is why we monitor new developments closely. If this extension is a feature you would be interested in, please write to us at facts@wolfSSL.com or call us at +1 425 245 8247.

## [wolfSSL DTLS 1.2 Connection ID](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-dtls-1-2-connection-id/)

* [January 8, 2025December 24, 2024](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-dtls-1-2-connection-id/)

[wolfSSL release 5.7.4](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) includes an exciting new feature. We have implemented Connection ID (CID) support for DTLS 1.2 (RFC 9146). CID is a new feature in DTLS 1.2 that allows for better handling of connection migration. Without it, DTLS connections are tied to the IP 5-tuple making it unable to recover the connection if one of the peers changes their address. This is where CID comes in. This feature is used to associate DTLS records from a new IP address to an existing connection. This is especially useful for mobile devices that may switch between Wi-Fi and cellular networks, or for any device that may change IP addresses during a connection.

Using CID’s in wolfSSL is easy. Just setup your connection as usual, but call [wolfSSL\_dtls\_cid\_use()](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/ssl_8h.html#function-wolfssl_dtls_cid_use) to enable the CID feature on the connection. This will enable the CID on your side of the connection. To request the peer to use a CID, use [wolfSSL\_dtls\_cid\_set()](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/ssl_8h.html#function-wolfssl_dtls_cid_set).

If you have any questions regarding CID’s in DTLS 1.2 or 1.3, please contact us at facts@wolfssl.com or +1 425 245 8247.

## [wolfSSL libspdm Support](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-libspdm-support/)

* [January 7, 2025December 24, 2024](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-libspdm-support/)

wolfSSL has added support for libspdm 3.3.0. libspdm is the reference implementation of the DMTF’s Security Protocols and Data Models (SPDM specifications). The goal of the SPDM specifications is to provide device attestation and authentication as well as secure communication over any transport. Both wolfSSL and SPDM are designed to operate on any transport.

Our wolfCrypt library is the underlying cryptographic library used by wolfSSL. [wolfCrypt](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt-2/) is a lightweight, embeddable, and easy-to-configure crypto library. It supports all the algorithms used by SPDM such as AES, CHACHA, POLY-1305, SHA-3, RSA, ECC. wolfCrypt is FIPS 140-3 validated and is available under both open source and commercial licenses. wolfCrypt also supports the Chinese SM ciphers SM2, SM3, and SM4.

If you have questions about the libspdm port or any other port, please contact us at facts@wolfSSL.com or +1 425 245 8247.

## [AI-automated fuzz testing uncovered a vulnerability in wolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/ai-automated-fuzz-testing-uncovered-a-vulnerability-in-wolfssl/)

* [January 6, 2025January 6, 2025](https://www.wolfssl.com/ai-automated-fuzz-testing-uncovered-a-vulnerability-in-wolfssl/)

[Code Intelligence](https://www.code-intelligence.com/) is happy to announce the discovery of a heap-based use-after-free vulnerability in wolfSSL, identified through a fuzz test automatically generated by an AI Test Agent. This marks another milestone in advancing automated security testing and demonstrates the power of AI-driven tools to improve software reliability and safety.

**Discovery and Resolution**

The vulnerability was identified during the final week of October 2024.

Remarkably, the discovery required no manual intervention—beyond setting up the project and typing “cifuzz spark” into the command line. This fuzz test, automatically generated and executed by Spark, the AI Test Agent, uncovered the critical data that exposed the flaw.

Spark, the AI Test Agent, is an enhancement to ?ode Intelligence’s fuzz testing product [CI Fuzz](https://www.code-intelligence.com/product-ci-fuzz). Leveraging LLMs and advanced static analysis, it autonomously identifies the most critical functions in the codebase to fuzz, generates and runs fuzz tests, and thus, finds bugs and vulnerabilities.

Spark will be [publicly demonstrated](https://www.code-intelligence.com/fuzzing-forward-lowering-barriers-to-secure-code-with-ai?utm_source=wolfsslblog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=launch2025) to the security and software development community on January 28, 2025. [Secure your free spot here](https://www.code-intelligence.com/fuzzing-forward-lowering-barriers-to-secure-code-with-ai?utm_source=wolfsslblog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=launch2025).

Spark uncovered the vulnerability in wolfSSL during its final beta testing. Code Intelligence reported the issue to the wolfSSL team immediately, and they responded with exceptional efficiency, resolving the vulnerability within 3 days.

[The fix](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8139) was officially included in [release wolfSSL 5.7.6](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.7.6-stable) on 31 December 2024.

In the only manual step, Peter Samarin from Code Intelligence has assessed and confirmed that the vulnerability exists and is exploitable under specific conditions.

We encourage developers to update to the latest version of wolfSSL to mitigate any potential risks.

**What Is a Heap-Based Use-After-Free?**

A heap-based use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a program continues to access memory on the heap after it has been freed.

In a typical scenario, a program allocates memory, uses it, and then frees it. However, if there is a mistake in memory management, such as a dangling pointer, a subsequent access attempt may interact with memory that has already been reallocated for another use.

This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or—more worryingly—security exploits that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or manipulate program behavior maliciously.

We are grateful to the Code Intelligence team for uncovering and reporting the vulnerability to us. You can explore the technical details of the issue in [Code Intelligence’s blog post](https://www.code-intelligence.com/blog/ai-generated-fuzz-test-wolfssl-vulnerability).

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
=========================================================
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.
2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section
7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
"keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.
8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.
Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
Copyright (C)
This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see .
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 Copyright (C)
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
.
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But first, please read
.
