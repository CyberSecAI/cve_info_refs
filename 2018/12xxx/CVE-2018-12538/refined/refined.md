Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12538:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `FileSessionDataStore` class of Eclipse Jetty, specifically how it loads session data from files. The `load(String id)` method searches for files using `name.contains(idWithContext)`. This method incorrectly matches files based on the provided ID being a prefix of the actual session ID, rather than an exact match.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session ID Matching:** The use of `contains()` for session ID matching instead of exact string matching allows for session hijacking by providing a partial session ID.
*   **Session Hijacking:** A malicious user can access other users' sessions by providing a partial session ID.
*   **Session Deletion:** It's also possible to delete other sessions by providing a partial session ID that matches, as the method is not intended for deletion, but the behavior causes files to be removed when no matching session is found based on the flawed search.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to other users' sessions, potentially leading to the ability to perform actions on their behalf, view their data, etc.
*   **Session Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete session data, causing disruption and potentially data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated `JSESSIONID` Cookie:** An attacker can modify their `JSESSIONID` cookie to include a partial or empty session ID. For example setting `JSESSIONID=` or `JSESSIONID=node0a`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with a modified `JSESSIONID` cookie.
*   The attacker needs no prior knowledge of the exact `JSESSIONID` of the target user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Jetty versions 9.4.0 to 9.4.8.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Jetty 9.4.9 by a complete overhaul of the `FileSessionDataStore`.
*   The vulnerability is only present in the `FileSessionDataStore` and does not affect default Jetty configurations.
*   The discovered was not aware of the vulnerability at the time of the fix in 9.4.9, and the issue was resolved inadvertently.
*   Affected NetApp products have also been identified, where the vendor provides a list of the specific products affected along with fixed versions of their software.
