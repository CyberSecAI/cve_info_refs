Release Notes for Patch Release #4790

4 Changes relevant for Operators

4.1 Changes of Conﬁguration Files

Change #SCR-175 Added new property com.openexchange.server.migrationRedirectURL to
server.properties
From the server.properties:
#Specifies the redirect URI/URL during cluster migration to which a client is redirected
in case it landed on a unsuitable node (running incompatible application code).
#E.g. a user gets routed to a node running application code in version X, but that account
has already been migrated to application code in version Y, e. g.: http://1.2.3.4
#No default value
com.openexchange.server.migrationRedirectURL=

Change #SCR-188 Changing readerengine.blacklist conﬁguration regexp from ﬁle://.* to .*
in order to block all (!) external Urls within document by default for security reasons
With the old setting, only ﬁle Urls to the local ﬁle system on the server were blacklisted. Since it
would be still possible to access web services on the local system via external Urls within the docu-
ment, the default has been changed to disallow all external Urls by default.
This strict setting has been chosen to forbid access to not allowed resources in a most secure way.

5 Tests

Not all defects that got resolved could be reproduced within the lab. Therefore, we advise guided
and close monitoring of the reported defect when deploying to a staging or production environ-
ment. Defects which have not been fully veriﬁed, are marked as such.
To avoid side effects, the shipped packages have gone through automated regression test on both,
a Continuous Integration System and a dedicated server set-up for system and integration testing.
All changes have been checked for potential side-effects and effect on behavior. Unless explicitly
stated within this document, we do not expect any side-effects.

Dear subscribers,

we're sharing our latest advisory with you and like to thank everyone who contributed in finding and solving those
vulnerabilities. Feel free to join our bug bounty programs (open-xchange, dovecot, powerdns) at HackerOne.

Yours sincerely,
 Martin Heiland, Open-Xchange GmbH

Product: OX App Suite
Vendor: OX Software GmbH

Internal reference: 58880 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-80)
Vulnerable version: 7.8.4 and 7.8.3
Vulnerable component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.8.4-rev34, 7.8.3-rev49
Vendor notification: 2018-06-05
Solution date: 2018-06-25
Public disclosure: 2018-12-31
Researcher Credits: Secator
CVE reference: CVE-2018-12611
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Unexpected "type" parameters of the "content" XML tag can be used to bypass our content sanitizer. In case users added
malicious RSS feeds to OX App Suite or a legit RSS feed got taken over, this can be used to inject script-code to a
users browser context.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mailicious RSS feed
2. Make users subscribe to this feed using OX App Suite

Proof of concept:
<content></content>
<content type="tex/html"></content>
<content type="garbage"></content>

Solution:
In addition to the existing sanitizers, we added a frontend-level protection to avoid plain-text to be executed as
script code.

Internal reference: 58874 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918)
Vulnerable version: 7.8.4 and earlier
Vulnerable component: documentconverter
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.8.4-rev5, 7.8.3-rev7, 7.6.3-rev4
Vendor notification: 2018-06-05
Solution date: 2018-06-25
Public disclosure: 2018-12-31
Researcher Credits: Secator
CVE reference: CVE-2018-12609
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Using specific XML tags within Powerpoint presentations can be used to trigger network requests on the server side
while converting the document.

Risk:
Internal network endpoints can be accessed and their default response is being exposed to the attacker. Attackers can
use timing attacks and response information to discover valid network services for reconnaissance.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mailicous PPTX file
2. Upload this file to OX App Suite
3. Trigger a document preview on the file

Proof of concept:
<Relationship
TargetMode="External"
Target="<http://localhost:8008/documentconverterws?action=convert&amp;url=http://localhost:8008/documentconverterws&amp;targetformat=png">;
Type="[http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image"](http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image%22);
Id="rId3">

Solution:
In addition to blocking file-system level access, we're now blocking all kinds of external references when processing
XML when convering documents.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12611
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
A API endpoint meant for monitoring purposes can be used to reflect HTTP headers and by that script code. To exploit
this, the user needs to follow a hyperlink on a malicious website.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Upload and share a snippet of bare JS code (no tags) to OX App Suite
2. Create a malicious website that redirects to "TestServlet"
3. Make the user follow a hyperlink that contains script code as URL parameter
4. The URL parameters content will be reflected as "referer" header by "TestServlet"

Proof of concept:
<https://www.example.com/referer.html>?<script/src=/appsuite/api/files/alert.json?action=document&folder=10&id=10%2F215&delivery=view></script/>

Solution:
We removed any reflected HTTP headers from TestServlet.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12611
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Font prefix information can bypass our sanitizers and returned as HTML content when using specific combinations of
brackets and quotes.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a HTML mail with malicious content like images with font parameters applied through CSS
2. Make a App Suite user open that mail

Proof of concept:
<p><img src=x style=font:"'onerror='{font:alert(document.cookie)}></p>
<p><img src=x style=font:"'onerror=alert(document.cookie),{></p>

Solution:
We now block font prefix information in case malformed font attributes are detected.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12611
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
A URL parameter can be used to inject fake "themes" to user settings. If a users follows such a malicious link, script
code is being executed.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a hyperlink containing the "theme" parameter, which refers to a URL containing script code
2. Make a user follow this link

Proof of concept:
<https://example.com/appsuite/#!!&app=io.ox/files&folder=9&theme=../../../0%22%2Balert>(document.cookie)%2B%22

Solution:
We added frontend sanitization to this kind of parameters as they are not processed by our sanitizers.

Vulnerability Details:
The "forgot password" link shown at the login page can be modified by using URL parameters. In case users are following
forged links, script code can be injected there.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a hyperlink containing the "forgot-password" parameter, which refers to a script code using URI scheme
2. Make a user follow this link

Proof of concept:
<https://example.com/appsuite/#!!&forgot-password=javascript:alert>(1)

Solution:
We removed usage of this URL parameter so it will not be reflected anymore.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12611
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
HTML mails can contain "mailto:"; hyperlinks with body parameters that make TinyMCE create E-Mails with HTML elements.
These elements can contain script code which is being executed if the user interacts with those elements.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted
actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a HTML mail with a hyperlink that points to a mailto: resource and contains script code
2. Make a user follow this link and then click the injected HTML element

Proof of concept:
mailto:aaa?body=%3Cselect%20onchange%3D%22alert(document.cookie)%22%3E%3Coption%3E2%3C%2Foption%3E%3Coption%3E2%3C%2Foption%3E%3C%2Fselect%3E

Solution:
We now sanitize HTML content which gets pasted to the HTML editor through "mailto:"; links.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12610
CVSS: 3.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
People which get access to (public) sharing links are able to request the share owners E-Mail address, even though its
not required to make sharing work.

Risk:
Semi-confidential information is being exposed unexpectedly to external entities. This can be used to run targetted
spam and malware attacks.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a share of files, calendar etc. and forward this link to the public or another person
2. Open the share link and run a "list" call of the user API and iterate through user IDs

Proof of concept:
PUT /appsuite/api/user?action=list&columns=1%2C20%2C500%2C501%2C502%2C505%2C524%2C555%2C606%2C614&session=xxx

<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><script
type="text/javascript">(parent["callback_yell"] || window.opener &&
window.opener["callback_yell"])({"data":[[6,6,"useruser\"><img>, =8*8","=8*8","useruser\"><img>",null,6,"user ()
example com",null,-1,null]],"timestamp":1523086065259})</script></head></html>

Solution:
We removeed user e-mail addresses when responding to API calls triggered by (anonymous) guests.

CVE reference: CVE-2018-12610
CVSS: 3.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
In case sessions to access shares are active they will not be terminated in case the owner of the share modifies the
shares pasword or lifetime.

Risk:
Existing user sessions have access to shares which security level has been upgraded or which are not meant to be
accessible by the previous set of users.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open or login to a share
2. As owner of the share, modify the shares password
3. Use the API to request shared data using the previously authenticated session

Proof of concept:
<https://example.com/appsuite/api/files?action=zipfolder&folder=851&recursive=true&session=xxx>

Solution:
We now terminate all active sessions for guests that have access to a share in case that shares password was modified.
