Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12710:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The D-Link DIR-601 router running firmware version 2.02NA exposes the administrator password in cleartext within an XML response to a specific POST request. This occurs even when a low-privileged "User" account is logged in.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Permissions:**  A low privilege user can access admin credentials.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The admin password is exposed in cleartext in an XML response.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining the admin password, an attacker can escalate their privileges from a regular user to an administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can obtain full administrative control of the router by gaining access to the administrator credentials. This would allow them to:
*   Modify router settings, including network configuration, firewall rules, and DNS settings.
*   Intercept network traffic.
*   Potentially use the compromised router as part of a botnet or for other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Network:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable router.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to the router's web interface after authenticating with a low-privilege account.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable D-Link DIR-601 router.
*   **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a valid "User" account on the router.
*   **Ability to intercept HTTP requests and responses:** Tools like BurpSuite can be used to intercept and analyze the router's web traffic.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks the "Tools" option in the router's web interface after logging in with a "User" account.
*   The vulnerable POST request is made to `/my_cgi.cgi`.
*   The admin username and password are found within the `<admin_user>` XML tag in the response.
* The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability.
