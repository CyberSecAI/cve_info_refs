{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NPLUG wireless repeater's web interface does not properly validate authentication, allowing access by setting a specific cookie.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Authentication bypass vulnerability due to improper handling of authentication cookies."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full access to the device's web interface, download configuration files containing plain text passwords, and activate the telnet daemon for root access without a password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by setting a cookie named 'admin:' in an HTTP request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. No prior authentication is needed if exploiting the authentication bypass directly, but the user must be on the same network."
