  "CVE-2018-12115": {
    "description": "nodejs: Out of bounds (OOB) write via UCS-2 encoding",
    "root_cause": "A flaw in Node.js's Buffer API, specifically in the Buffer#write() method when used with UCS-2 encoding. A miscalculation of the maximum length of input bytes when writes start from the second-to-last position can cause writes to occur outside of the bounds of a single Buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption which can lead to process crashes, and potentially allow for sensitive information to be leaked or for arbitrary code execution through writing outside of buffer memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious server sending crafted data during TLS handshake",
       "Malicious Jenkins pipeline",
       "Malicious source code supplied to Node.js application",
       "Abuse of Buffer API using UCS-2 encoding"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
     "Ability to make a connection to a vulnerable Node.js application or server",
     "Ability to provide malicious or crafted input to trigger the vulnerable code path.",
      "Code execution on a system with a vulnerable version of Node.js"
    ],
     "notes": "The vulnerability is present in versions of Node.js 6.x, 8.x, and 10.x. Patches are available in Node.js 6.14.4, 8.11.4, and 10.9.0"
