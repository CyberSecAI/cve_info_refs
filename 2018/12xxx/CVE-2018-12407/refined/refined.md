Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-12407:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ANGLE graphics library, specifically within the `VertexBuffer11` module. This occurs during the process of drawing and validating elements. The vulnerability is triggered when manipulating HTML elements within a website using JavaScript, which leads to the corruption of a heap-based buffer within the `VertexBuffer11` module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in the `VertexBuffer11` module of the ANGLE library.
- Incorrect memory management within the `VertexBuffer11::storeVertexAttributes` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted websites that utilize WebGL content.
- The attacker manipulates HTML elements using JavaScript to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or control a website with malicious WebGL content.
- The user must be tricked into visiting this website.
- The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate specific HTML elements and javascript in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the `VertexBuffer11` module and how it interacts with WebGL content to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Windows 10 x64 and Firefox 63.0, however other platforms may be affected.
- The vulnerability is present in the ANGLE library, which is used by Firefox for WebGL rendering.
- The issue was resolved by a large ANGLE update introduced in Firefox 64.
- This vulnerability is distinct from other ANGLE-related issues, particularly the one described in bug 1488295 related to `TextureStorage11`.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "sec-high" security issue.
- The vulnerability is not present in Firefox ESR60, thus is marked as "unaffected".
- The vulnerability is not present in Firefox 64 beta or the current version of ESR60.
