Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "CorsairService" service, installed by the Corsair Utility Engine software, has insecure default service permissions. Specifically, the local Windows "Everyone" security group is granted "SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS" permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure service permissions: The "Everyone" group having "SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS" is the core vulnerability. This allows any local user to modify the service configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: An unprivileged local user can execute arbitrary commands with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.
- Privilege escalation: A local user can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local privilege escalation: Attackers must have local access to the system.
- Abuse of insecure service permissions: Attackers exploit the overly permissive service access rights.
- Modification of `BINARY_PATH_NAME`: Attackers modify the service's binary path to point to their malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have a local user account on the target system.
- Basic understanding of Windows services: The attacker needs knowledge of how to modify service configurations and binary paths.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Product: Corsair Utility Engine versions 3.2.87, 3.3.103, 3.4.95, 3.6.109, and 3.7.99 were specifically tested and found to be vulnerable. Other versions might also be affected.
- Fixed Product: Corsair Utility Engine version 3.13.94.
- Timeline: The vulnerability was reported to Corsair in June 2018, with repeated notifications of the ongoing issue in subsequent releases until October 2018. A fix was released in February 2019.
