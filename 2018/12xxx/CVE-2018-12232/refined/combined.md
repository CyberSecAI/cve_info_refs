## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-oem](/security/cves?package=linux-oem) - Linux kernel for OEM processors

## Details

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# USN-3752-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

24 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3752-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

socket: close race condition between sock\_close() and sockfs\_setattr()

```
fchownat() doesn't even hold refcnt of fd until it figures out
fd is really needed (otherwise is ignored) and releases it after
it resolves the path. This means sock_close() could race with
sockfs_setattr(), which leads to a NULL pointer dereference
since typically we set sock->sk to NULL in ->release().

As pointed out by Al, this is unique to sockfs. So we can fix this
in socket layer by acquiring inode_lock in sock_close() and
checking against NULL in sockfs_setattr().

sock_release() is called in many places, only the sock_close()
path matters here. And fortunately, this should not affect normal
sock_close() as it is only called when the last fd refcnt is gone.
It only affects sock_close() with a parallel sockfs_setattr() in
progress, which is not common.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-alt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2948)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3658021>

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting CVE-2018-3639; Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391; Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-1120; David Rientjes (Google) for reporting CVE-2018-1000200; and Wen Xu for reporting CVE-2018-1092, CVE-2018-1094, and CVE-2018-1095. The CVE-2018-14619 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer (Red Hat) and Ondrej Mosnacek (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Release Notes linked from the References section.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

socket: close race condition between sock\_close() and sockfs\_setattr()fchownat() doesn't even hold refcnt of fd until it figures out
fd is really needed (otherwise is ignored) and releases it after
it resolves the path. This means sock\_close() could race with
sockfs\_setattr(), which leads to a NULL pointer dereference
since typically we set sock->sk to NULL in ->release().
As pointed out by Al, this is unique to sockfs. So we can fix this
in socket layer by acquiring inode\_lock in sock\_close() and
checking against NULL in sockfs\_setattr().
sock\_release() is called in many places, only the sock\_close()
path matters here. And fortunately, this should not affect normal
sock\_close() as it is only called when the last fd refcnt is gone.
It only affects sock\_close() with a parallel sockfs\_setattr() in
progress, which is not common.

fchownat() doesn't even hold refcnt of fd until it figures out
fd is really needed (otherwise is ignored) and releases it after
it resolves the path. This means sock_close() could race with
sockfs_setattr(), which leads to a NULL pointer dereference
since typically we set sock->sk to NULL in ->release().

As pointed out by Al, this is unique to sockfs. So we can fix this
in socket layer by acquiring inode_lock in sock_close() and
checking against NULL in sockfs_setattr().

sock_release() is called in many places, only the sock_close()
path matters here. And fortunately, this should not affect normal
sock_close() as it is only called when the last fd refcnt is gone.
It only affects sock_close() with a parallel sockfs_setattr() in
progress, which is not common.

That looks like a massive overkill - it's way heavier than it should be.
And it's very likely to trigger shitloads of deadlock warnings, some
possibly even true.

I don't see any other quick way to fix this. My initial thought is
to keep that refcnt until path_put(), apparently you don't like it
either.

I do audit the inode_lock usage in networking, I don't see any
deadlock, of course, there could be some non-networking code
uses socket API that I missed. But _generally_, socket doesn't
have a pointer to retrieve this inode.

You do realize that the same ->setattr() can be called by way of
chown() on /proc/self/fd/<n>, right?  What would you do there -
bump refcount on that struct file when traversing that symlink and
hold it past the end of pathname resolution, until... what exactly?

I was thinking about this:

        error = user_path_at(dfd,....); // hold dfd when needed

        if (!error) {
                error = chown_common(&path, mode);
                path_put(&path);      // release dfd if held

With this, we can guarantee ->release() is only possibly called
after chown_common() which is after ->setattr() too.

No, we can't.  You are assuming that there *is* dfd and that it points
to the opened socket we are going to operate upon.  That is not guaranteed.
At all.  If e.g. 42 is a file descriptor of an opened socket, plain chown(2)
on /proc/self/fd/42 will trigger that ->setattr().  No dfd in sight.
We do run across an opened file at some point, all right - when we traverse
the symlink in procfs.  You can't bump ->f_count there.  Even leaving aside
the "where would I stash the reference to that file?" and "how long would I
hold it?", you can't bump ->f_count on other process' files.  That would
bugger the expectations of close(2) callers.

I'm applying this for now, it is at least a step towards fixing
all of these issues.

If it is really offensive, I can revert, just tell me.

Thanks, David!

Unless there is something fundamentally broken, there is no
reason to revert it. The only risk here is some possible deadlock,
but I am ready to fix any deadlock report caused by this
patch. :)

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1020-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1020.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1020.20)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-1020-kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1020.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1020.20)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-1021-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.15.0-1021.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.15.0-1021.23)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
