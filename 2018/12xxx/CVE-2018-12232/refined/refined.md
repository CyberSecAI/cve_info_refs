{
  "CVE-2018-12232": {
    "Description": "A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's socket handling code. Specifically, a race exists between the close() and fchownat() system calls when they share a socket file descriptor. This race can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Root cause": "Race condition between the close() and fchownat() system calls when sharing a socket file descriptor.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is required to execute the system calls. No special privileges are explicitly needed to trigger the vulnerability."
