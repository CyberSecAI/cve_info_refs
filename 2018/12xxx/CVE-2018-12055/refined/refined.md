Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12055

**Vulnerable Software:** PHP Scripts Mall Schools Alert Management Script

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in several PHP files, specifically: `contact_us.php`, `faq.php`, `about.php`, `photo_gallery.php`, and `privacy.php`. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly embeds user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Database compromise:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify existing records, or potentially gain complete control over the database. This could include access to student, teacher, and admin information, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruption.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the database server configuration, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server through SQL injection.
* **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact:** Successful exploitation leads to high impact in all three categories, as per the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack is performed over the network.
* **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerable files are accessed via HTTP POST requests, with the malicious SQL payload embedded in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable application.
* **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication or user interaction.

**Technical Details:**
The proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted HTTP POST request.
The exploit uses the `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to inject SQL commands into the vulnerable application.
Example POST data: `xxx'/**/union/**/all/**/select/**/1,user(),3,4#` sent to `/photo_gallery.php`.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by "unh3x".
* The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.8.
* Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) estimates a 11.026% probability of exploitation within the next 30 days.
* The vendor, PHP Scripts Mall, did not specify patch versions.

In summary, the provided content details a critical SQL injection vulnerability affecting multiple files within the PHP Scripts Mall Schools Alert Management Script due to improper input handling, which could allow remote attackers to compromise the database without any authentication.
