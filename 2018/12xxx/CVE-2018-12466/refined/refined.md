Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the permission check logic within the open build service (obs) when handling package deletion in the context of project links. The system was incorrectly checking permissions based on the linked project rather than the actual project where the package resided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Check:** The core issue is that the system was following project links when checking permissions for package deletion. This meant that if a package existed in a linked project, the permission check would be performed against the linked project instead of the actual project containing the package.
*   **Project Link Bypass:** This incorrect check could be bypassed by creating a project link and then creating a package within that linked project that had the same name as a package in a different target project, which allowed an attacker with incorrect permissions to delete it.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Package Deletion:** An attacker could potentially delete packages in projects they did not have explicit permissions for by leveraging project links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Package Deletion:** An attacker could delete a package from a project by exploiting the project link mechanism, even if the attacker did not have explicit permissions to do so in the target project. This could lead to data loss and/or impact system integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Project Link Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a project link.
*   **Package Creation in Linked Project:** The attacker must be able to create a package in the linked project with the same name as the target package they want to delete.
*   **Request Submission:** The attacker must create a submit request that would cause the package deletion through the project link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create project links.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create packages within these linked projects.
*   The attacker must be able to submit requests to the system that would trigger the deletion, which could occur during package update or cleanup actions in a project.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes discussions about different potential fixes, including not allowing package deletion through project links at all, or performing stricter permission checks at various stages of the request processing.
*   The fix implemented involved correcting the permission check logic to ensure that permissions are checked against the actual project containing the package, and not the project being linked. The fix also added permission checks for source package updates within the scope of maintenance incidents.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Marcus Meissner.

In summary, CVE-2018-12466 is a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to potentially delete packages from projects where they did not have permissions by exploiting the project link functionality. The vulnerability was resolved by fixing the permission check logic to consider the correct project when deleting packages.
