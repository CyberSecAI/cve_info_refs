### Bug Description

Dear all,

The following null pointer dereference bug was found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the causing hfs filesystem image, the dmesg report and the source code of a simple mounting tool to reproduce this issue.

A local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to mount filesystems (or a system components which auto mounts filesystems) could trigger a null pointer dereference or a kernel panic (depending on panic\_on\_oops).

We can verify this issues for Linux 4.15.0-15.16 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source linux"). The desktop version of ubuntu auto-mounts this file system if provided via USB.

According to Matthew Wilcox this is probably a won't fix bug with a recommendation to the Ubuntu developers to disable or remove support for this orphaned kernel module:

<https://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=152407263325766&w=2>

However, since this is still a vulnerability which can be exploited to trigger a local denial-of-service, could you please somehow fix this issue and assign a CVE?

Best regards,

Sergej
