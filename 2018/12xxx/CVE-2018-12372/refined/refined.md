    "CVE-2018-12372": {
      "content": "The vulnerability is a result of how Thunderbird handles decrypted S/MIME parts within crafted HTML emails. When included in an HTML reply or forward, the plaintext of the decrypted S/MIME part can be leaked. An attacker who has access to S/MIME encrypted messages can craft an HTML email containing the encrypted part, and send this email to the intended recipient. Once the recipient decrypts and replies to or forwards the email, the plaintext content is leaked, as it's included in the reply/forwarded message. \n\nAttack Vectors: A specially crafted HTML email.\nWeaknesses/Vulnerabilities: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of decrypted S/MIME content when composing HTML replies/forwards.\nImpact of Exploitation:  An attacker can leak the plaintext content of S/MIME encrypted messages by sending a specially crafted email and tricking the user into replying or forwarding it. \nRequired Attacker Capabilities/Position: An attacker needs access to S/MIME encrypted messages and must be able to send an email to the victim."

      "CVE-2018-12374": {
      "content": "The vulnerability is due to Thunderbird's handling of forms within HTML emails. It was discovered that forms could be used to exfiltrate encrypted mail parts by pressing the enter key in a form field. If a user presses the enter key inside a form input field in an email where S/MIME was used to encrypt the content, the encrypted part may be sent to a malicious location.\n\nAttack Vectors: Sending a specially crafted email with an embedded form.\nWeaknesses/Vulnerabilities: The vulnerability lies in Thunderbird's failure to properly handle form submission in the context of S/MIME encrypted emails.\nImpact of Exploitation:  An attacker can obtain sensitive information by using a form to exfiltrate encrypted mail parts from a user by tricking them to press enter inside an input field of the form embedded inside the email.\nRequired Attacker Capabilities/Position: An attacker needs to send the user a crafted email and the user must press the enter key inside an input field of an embedded form."
    },
    "CVE-2018-12360": {
      "content": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a use-after-free condition in the `nsFocusManager::CheckIfFocusable` function. This occurs when an input element is removed during a mutation event triggered by focusing on the element.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free in `nsFocusManager::CheckIfFocusable` when deleting an input element during a mutation event handler triggered by focusing that element.\n\nImpact of exploitation: A potentially exploitable crash, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nAttack vectors: Triggering a focus event on an input element, then deleting the same element during a mutation event handler.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the DOM and trigger focus events, potentially using crafted HTML."
