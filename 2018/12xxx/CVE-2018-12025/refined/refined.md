The provided content discusses CVE-2018-12025, which affects the FuturXE (FXE) ERC20 smart contract.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect boolean check in the `transferFrom` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The `if( allowed[from][msg.sender] >= value ) return false;` line in the `transferFrom` function is flawed. Instead of checking if the allowed transfer amount is sufficient, it checks if it's greater or equal and then incorrectly stops the execution with a return false. This should check if the allowed amount is less than the transfer value, if it is, the execution should stop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass the allowance check. The incorrect conditional statement and subsequent logic allows an attacker to transfer any amount of tokens from any account, to an arbitrary address, irrespective of the actual allowed amount. If the `allowed[from][msg.sender]` value is less than the intended transfer amount `value`, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` line results in an underflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is the `transferFrom` function within the smart contract. An attacker can call this function with arbitrary `from`, `to`, and `value` parameters. The vulnerability exists due to the incorrect allowance check, allowing unauthorized transfers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to interact with the smart contract, by creating a transaction with specific parameters and sending it to the Ethereum blockchain. They do not need any special access or the private key of any other users, as long as the contract code is deployed.
