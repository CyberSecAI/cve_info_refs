Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition within the ONOS access control application (onos-acl).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition where the system checks a condition (host information) at one point, but the actual use of that information occurs later. During the time gap, a malicious actor can alter the relevant data (corrupt the host information base), leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Data Plane Access Control Bypass:** The race condition allows a malicious end host to circumvent the intended data plane access control policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Access Control:** A successful exploit allows a malicious end host to bypass the data plane access control rules that are intended to restrict network access.
- **Data Plane Corruption:** By sending a semantically invalid packet, a malicious actor can corrupt the host information base, thus preventing the application of flow deny rules.
- **Compromised Network Security:** This can lead to unauthorized access to network resources and potentially other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious End Host:** The attack is launched by a malicious end host within the network.
- **Semantically Invalid Packets:** The attacker sends a semantically invalid packet into the data plane to trigger the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have a position on the network where they can send packets that will be processed by the vulnerable ONOS instance.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of how the ONOS access control application works and how to manipulate packet structures to exploit the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content provides more detail than a basic CVE description would typically offer. It describes the attack vector, the specific race condition, and the impact of a successful exploit.
- The affected versions of ONOS are also clearly identified (1.12.0 and 1.13.0) along with the corresponding patch commit.
