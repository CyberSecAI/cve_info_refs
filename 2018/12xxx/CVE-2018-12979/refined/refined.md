Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732):** The root cause of this vulnerability is that critical files in the web root directory of the WAGO e!DISPLAY devices have weak permissions. Specifically, the `index.html` file is owned by the 'www' user, which is also the user context under which the web server operates. This allows the 'www' user to modify or overwrite this critical file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permissions:** The primary weakness is the inadequate file permissions on critical resources.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CVE-2018-12980):**  This vulnerability is a critical factor because it enables an authenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the file system via the WBM.
*  **Chained Exploitation:** This vulnerability is part of a chain, where it is exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (Cross-Site Scripting and Arbitrary File Upload) to achieve Remote Code Execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Overwriting:** An authenticated attacker can leverage the unrestricted file upload vulnerability to upload malicious files and, due to the weak permissions, overwrite critical files, like `index.html`.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By overwriting critical files with malicious content (e.g. a web shell), the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the device with the privileges of the 'www' user.
*   **Authentication Bypass**: The ability to overwrite files in the web root, can result in an authentication bypass by replacing the login page with a malicious one.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the attacker only gets code execution under the context of the webserver user 'www', this can be used for further exploitation and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is launched over the network by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface (WBM) of the WAGO e!DISPLAY device.
*   **Abuse of File Upload:** Attackers leverage the file upload functionality of the WBM to introduce malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the WAGO e!DISPLAY device over the network.
*   **Authentication (for direct exploitation of CVE-2018-12979):** An attacker would need to be an authenticated user on the device's web-based management interface to directly exploit the incorrect permissions, but the exploit can be chained with reflected XSS to circumvent this.
*   **Chained Attack**: Since the attacker can chain this with a reflected cross site scripting attack and file upload vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12980 and CVE-2018-12981), they can achieve remote code execution with a relatively low skill level.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects WAGO e!DISPLAY devices with firmware versions prior to FW 02. Specific affected models are 762-3000, 762-3001, 762-3002, and 762-3003.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by T. Weber of SEC Consult.
*   A patch was released by WAGO in the form of firmware FW 02.

In summary, CVE-2018-12979 is a critical vulnerability because it allows authenticated users or unauthenticated users via chaining with XSS to overwrite critical files on the WAGO e!DISPLAY devices. Combined with other vulnerabilities, this can result in remote code execution.
