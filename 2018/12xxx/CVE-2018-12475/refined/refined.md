{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `obs-service-download_files`, `download_src_package` and `download_url` services in openSUSE allow specifying localhost or intranet URLs as a source, which are then accessed by the service's backend.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The services route localhost and intranet host requests to the internet, potentially exposing internal services and data. Specifically, the service's backend becomes accessible via the service itself.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use these services to access internal resources (such as the service's backend or other intranet hosts) by specifying them in the source URL. This allows an attacker to retrieve data from these internal services and/or potentially cause other unintended side effects.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker specifies a localhost or intranet URL in the `Source0` parameter of a spec file, which is processed by the vulnerable service. This service then makes a GET request to the specified URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify spec files that are processed by the vulnerable service."
