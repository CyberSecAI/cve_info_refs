| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-10 10:38:59 UTC  ``` While auditing the download_files services I noticed that it is possible to specify localhost source URLs in spec files like:    Source0:        <http://localhost:5352/build/_workerstatus>  This way the download_files service performs a GET request at the bs_srcserver backend and stores the reply that I was able to retrieve from the OBS server like this:  $ osc cat home:<user>/<package>/_service:download_files:_workerstatus  It is probably possible to access other ports on localhost or reachable intranet / DMZ hosts that offer http, https or ftp protocol access.  Fixing the localhost case should be not too hard but fixing the case for other intranet hosts could be difficile. We need to make sure that the target host really is a publicly accesible host. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-10 11:06:50 UTC  ``` The download_src_package service (currently no maintainer assigned) similarly allows to specify localhost URLs, although it does not allow to save the output. Requests still go out. I can open a separate bug for that if required. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-10 11:27:09 UTC  ``` And the same possibility also applies to the download_url service. This one also allows saving the output under an arbitrary name. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-26 09:18:37 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2018-12475 for this. Keeping private for now since I don't see discussions of a PR here ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c4)  Ruediger Oertel   2019-10-16 12:42:39 UTC  ``` Adrian: do you want to take this one ? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-03-02 12:39:33 UTC  ``` According to our new formal disclosure policy [1] I'm setting an internal CRD for this issue. Since it's already quite old I think 30 days from now are fair. After this date this issue will be published - fixed or not.  Internal CRD: 2020-04-01 or earlier  [1]: [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c6)  Adrian Schröter   2020-04-20 13:31:03 UTC  ``` I don't really see the exact problem here, if files are offered via http they should be accessable.  Also for intranet it must be still possible to reach these servers as this is a valid usecase.  I mean, would you also create an issue against wget that it can download from intranet based on files you can download? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-04-21 08:14:52 UTC  ``` The problem here is, simply spoken, that the download_files services is routing localhost and intranet hosts into the internet.  The most obvious example from [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c0) is that the *backend* is directly reachable via the service. I can't believe that this is intended. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c8)  Adrian Schröter   2020-04-21 08:31:30 UTC  ``` okay, so we speak about server side mode (not local run and neither buildtime).  Yes, that the src-server is reachable is a problem, but a generic setup issue and not a specific problem of this service.  We either need to protect us via container or ipaccess rules here. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c9)  Johannes Segitz   2020-04-22 11:24:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c8)) Malte brought up the idea of using bpf, which would also allow the necessary filtering.   So as this is now being worked upon we set a new Internal CRD: 2020-05-06 Please work on this with priority. The original report is from 2018, so this has been known for a long time and according to our disclosure policy this should already be public. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c10)  Ismail Dönmez   2020-04-22 11:58:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adrian Schröter from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c8)) > okay, so we speak about server side mode (not local run and neither > buildtime). >  > Yes, that the src-server is reachable is a problem, but a generic setup > issue and not a specific problem of this service. >  > We either need to protect us via container or ipaccess rules here.  Short of using a container or a bpf based jail (like firejail), would it just make sense to block access to the following subnets for bs_srcserver?  10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 127.0.0.0/24 ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1107821#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2020-05-11 14:18:07 UTC  ``` CRD reached, making public ``` |  |
