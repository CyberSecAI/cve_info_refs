Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12254

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `EkrishtaUsrID` function within the `router.php` file of the Ek Rishta component for Joomla. This function directly incorporates unsanitized user input from the URL into an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `EkrishtaUsrID` function fails to sanitize the `username` parameter from the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `username` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker could modify or delete data from the database if they have sufficient privileges
- **Complete System Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the database and, possibly, the entire Joomla installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `username` segment within the URL in the format `/index.php/home/requested_user/Sent%20interest/[username]`. The attacker inserts malicious SQL code instead of a valid username.
- **PATH_INFO:** The vulnerability is specifically exploitable via the `PATH_INFO` part of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the Joomla platform to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL structure.
- **Basic SQL Injection Knowledge:** A basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet from `router.php`:

```php
function EkrishtaUsrID($uid_name)
{
	 $db = JFactory::getDBO();
	 $sql = "SELECT `id` FROM #__users WHERE `username`= '" .$uid_name."'";
	 $db->setQuery($sql);
	 return $db->loadResult();
}
```
- The code directly concatenates the `$uid_name` variable (derived from the URL) into the SQL query string, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.
- An example of an attack URL would be `/index.php/home/requested_user/Sent%20interest/1'or%20extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select%20table_name%20from%20information_schema.tables)))%20%23`. This would use error-based SQL injection to extract database table names.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to enumerate tables, columns, and other data in the database.
