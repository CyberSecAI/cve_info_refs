    "content": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability related to the .SettingContent-ms file type in Windows 10. This file type, intended for creating shortcuts to settings pages, can be abused to execute arbitrary shell commands via the <DeepLink> element. \n\nThe vulnerability exists because Windows does not display any warning before executing a .SettingContent-ms file, even when downloaded from the internet with a 'Mark-of-the-Web.' This allows attackers to deliver malicious payloads by embedding them within Office documents via Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), circumventing Office 2016's blocking of 'dangerous' file formats. Furthermore, attackers can bypass Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules by using whitelisted binaries like 'AppVLP.exe' within the Office path, allowing command execution even when child processes from Office applications are blocked.\n\nThe bugzilla entry confirms that the .SettingContent-ms file extension bypasses the dangerous file prompt in Firefox, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) via web extensions.  The patch adds 'SettingContent-ms' to the list of executable file extensions to trigger a warning dialog before opening such a file. This prevents arbitrary code execution without user warning by blocking file execution if a malicious extension creates a file with the vulnerable extension. The report also notes that a missing warning exists within windows even when files are marked with MOTW. The reporter also notes that Microsoft considered the issue low severity and was not planning on fixing it.\n\nMultiple documents from Mozilla confirm the vulnerability and that it was fixed in Firefox and Thunderbird. They also confirm that the vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution on Windows Systems and is considered a moderate impact vulnerability. \n\n",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of warning when executing .SettingContent-ms files in Windows 10, even when the file is downloaded from the internet. Additionally, Office 2016 does not block this file extension when embedding it through OLE, and ASR rules can be bypassed using whitelisted binaries.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Lack of warning for .SettingContent-ms execution.",
        "Bypass of Office OLE block list.",
        "Bypass of ASR child process creation rules.",
        "Firefox download handling of .SettingContent-ms files does not display a warning.",
        "WebExtensions with limited permissions can execute arbitrary code via .SettingContent-ms."
      ],
      "Impact": "Arbitrary shell command or code execution on the target system.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Direct download from the internet.",
        "Embedding in Office documents using OLE.",
         "Firefox download via a browser extension with downloads.open permissions."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to deliver a .SettingContent-ms file to the target system, either directly or through an Office document. For Firefox, attacker must be able to craft a malicious extension to facilitate file execution."
