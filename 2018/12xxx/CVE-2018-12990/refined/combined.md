 Hello All, In this blog, we dive into the dark side of package files and Storage Account abuse within the Azure Function App service. We explore how package files can be leveraged to enhance the functionality of the Functions Apps, shedding light on the potential abuse of package files. By examining the connection between the Function App and Storage Account, we uncover how attackers can abuse the Storage Account's connection string to gain unauthorized access to the Function Apps. We will provide step-by-step insights into replacing binary files and deploying custom code, enabling attackers to take control of the Function App.  The research was jointly done by  Raunak and myself . What are Function Apps? Function Apps (Lambda in AWS) are serverless computing services provided by Azure Cloud. They allow developers to build and deploy small, functions that can be triggered by events such as simple HTTP request. Function Apps provide an environment for executing our code ...

 Hello All, Active directory is a backbone of almost all the organizations. It helps the IT team to manage the systems, users, policies etc, centrally across the complete network. Since it is integral part of the organization, it open's multiple opportunity for the attackers to leverage the features of active directory and abuse them for malicious intent. We will look at one such feature known as Active Directory Replication in this post.  In this post we will look at few approach that we can use to detect the DCSync attack and gain understand about the attack. DCSync attack and detection is already explained by Sean Metcalf & Will Schroeder in their blog post. About Active Directory Replication Domain Controllers (DC) are the pillars of Active Directory (AD) environment. Organizations often have multiple Domain Controllers for it's Active Directory as a backup or they have different Domain Controllers for each location so that the authentication and other policies can b...

Hello All, In this blog post, we will explore the Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability discovered by the WIZ team in Azure Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) application that was assigned a CVE ID - CVE-2021-38647. The blog post published by the WIZ team contains all the details that are required to exploit the vulnerability if a vulnerable instance is available. While reading the blog post, we thought of reproducing the scenario and create some quick PoC to exploit the vulnerability. We are releasing Proof of Concept (PoC) code in PowerShell & Python. The PoC code is published on the Github repo . About Azure Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) OMI is a UNIX/Linux application installed on the Azure UNIX/Linux VM that allows users to manage the machine & configuration remotely & locally. It is equivalent to Windows WMI that uses the Common Information Model (CIM). It runs with root privileges. The OMI application gets installed automatically when service...

Hello All, In this post we will discuss on how to perform Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) attack from an Linux machine to be specific we will use Kali Linux as an attacker machine. RBCD attacks is already been explained in detailed by  Will Schroeder ,  Elad Shamir  &  Dirk-jan Mollema  in their blog posts.  What is Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) ? In Windows Server 2012 Microsoft introduced a new type of delegation wherein the Service Administrators or Owner of the resources are allowed to configure which accounts are trusted to delegate to them. As per the Microsoft Docs this can also be configured across the domains.  This also shifts the decision of whether a server should trust the source of a delegated identity from the delegating-from domain administrator to the resource owner. Access is controlled by the security descriptor on the target resource instead of an list of SPN records. The security descriptor are stor...

Hello All,

**​INTRODUCTION**

T​he purpose of this post is to let you know how I managed to get one more CVE​. Throughout this post, I will give you relevant examples/screenshots that demonstrates how I ended up finding the vulnerability.

​Alright, lets plunge into the Proof-Of-Concept !

​

**PATH OF EXPLORATION**

​

After submitting the first vulnerability (Stored Cross Site Scripting) to the developer for phpwcms application I continued to test further for finding more vulnerability. While testing I saw that CSRF Token was submitted in all the request. I tried to tamper with the parameter which contained the CSRF Token and found that the application throws an error which discloses the Internal Path of the application where it has been hosted.

**THE MOST AWAITED DEEP DIVE POC​**

1) While submitting the profile page request I saw that the application passes one parameter (csrf\_token\_value) which as per the name suggest contains the csrf token as you can refer the below screenshot.

The CSRF Token was passed on mostly all pages in the application.

2) I modified the last 2 numbers of **csrf\_token\_value** parameter and submitted the request to check if it validates the token.

Hello All, Performing Red Team assessments are becoming challenging day by day. In mature environments we see a lot of custom tool development and new techniques are getting discovered by the community to overcome various challenges. While thinking about such challenges, I came up with the idea of creating a tool that can leverage legitimate services for establishing command & control communication channel which is likely to be whitelisted or are less monitored due to the nature of services used by the corporate environments. This is not a new technique, we have already seen similar projects that were developed to leverage legitimate services for command & control. Communication channels such as Slackor for Slack C2, DaaC2 for Discord C2 or  Domain Fronting techniques etc. In this post I will introduce you to a tool called "Callidus" which I created to learn & to improve my knowledge about developing custom toolset in C# and learning how to leverage ...

Hello All, After publishing the post about Dumping Process Memory with Custom C# Code my friend Himanshu suggested me to write a tool & a blog post about Process Injection for learning and he referenced his post about Code Injection which covers the concept about the vanilla process injection technique. It was quite interesting to learn and understand the core concepts about Process Injection techniques and as a learning path to code in c# leveraging Windows API I started writing the tool for Process Injection. What is Process Injection ? Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. Why Process Injection ? ...

Dear Team,

I have found one vulnerability in the PHPWCMS which discloses the internal path of the application where it has been hosted. I have posted a blog and made a public disclosure about the vulnerability bcoz it wasn't fixed for more than 8 months.
