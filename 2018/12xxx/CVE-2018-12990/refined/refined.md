Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the CSRF token within the PHPWCMS application. Specifically, when the application encounters a tampered or invalid CSRF token, it throws an error message that includes the internal path of the application on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the application's internal path, which could reveal sensitive information about the server's structure and configuration.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the CSRF token, resulting in an error that exposes sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to obtain the full path of the application on the server.
- **Reconnaissance:** This information can be used by an attacker for further reconnaissance and planning of more targeted attacks on the system, potentially increasing the risk of further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Tampering with CSRF Token:** The attacker modifies the `csrf_token_value` parameter in requests to the application. This can be done on any page where a CSRF token is used
- **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a manipulated request to the web server and triggers the error response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how web applications work, including request parameters and error messages.
- **Ability to Intercept and Modify Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify web requests to tamper with the CSRF token before submitting to the server. This could be done through a proxy or browser developer tools.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without the need for prior authentication.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered in the phpwcms application.
- The vulnerability was reported to the developer on 23 October 2017, but was not fixed, leading to public disclosure on 29 June 2018
- The attacker only needed to change the last two digits of the `csrf_token_value` parameter to trigger the error message.
- The vulnerability was confirmed and assigned CVE-2018-12990
