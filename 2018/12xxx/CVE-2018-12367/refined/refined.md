{
  "CVE-2018-12367": {
    "Description": "In the previous mitigations for Spectre, the resolution or precision of various methods was reduced to counteract the ability to measure precise time intervals. In that work, `PerformanceNavigationTiming` was not adjusted but it was found that it could be used as a precision timer.",
    "Root cause": "The `PerformanceNavigationTiming` API was not adjusted to reduce time precision, thus allowing for precise time intervals to be measured, which could be exploited in a timing attack similar to Spectre.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient mitigation against timing attacks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Precise time measurement could be used in Spectre-like timing attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web content"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript/access web page to leverage this vulnerability"
  }
