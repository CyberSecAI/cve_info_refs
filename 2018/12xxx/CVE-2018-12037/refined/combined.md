**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20181112-0001
**Version:**
7.0

**Last updated:**
11/18/2020

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2018-12037, CVE-2018-12038

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products contain Self-Encrypting Solid State Drives. Researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands reported multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of ATA Security and TCG Opal Standards in Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) which can allow an attacker with physical access to the drive and instrumented hardware and firmware to decrypt the contents of an encrypted drive.

#### Impact

ONTAP, SANtricity and StorageGRID based products do not support any of the drive models referenced within the paper from the researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker with physical access to the drive and instrumented hardware and firmware to decrypt the contents of an encrypted drive.
