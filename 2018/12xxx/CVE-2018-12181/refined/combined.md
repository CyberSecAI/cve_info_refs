| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-26 17:40:53 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in edk2. When registering a Ram disk whose size is not a multiple of 512 bytes, the BlockIo protocol produced by the RamDiskDxe driver will incur memory read/write overrun. The memory overrun will happen when reading/writing the last block on the Ram disk.   Upstream Bug: <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1134>  Upstream Patch: <https://lists.01.org/pipermail/edk2-devel/2019-February/037248.html> <https://lists.01.org/pipermail/edk2-devel/2019-February/037249.html> <https://lists.01.org/pipermail/edk2-devel/2019-February/037250.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-26 17:41:14 UTC  ``` Created edk2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1683374](show_bug.cgi?id=1683374 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-12180 edk2: Buffer Overflow in BlockIo service for RAM disk [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1683373](show_bug.cgi?id=1683373 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-12180 edk2: Buffer Overflow in BlockIo service for RAM disk [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-01 15:09:27 UTC  ``` Functions RamDiskBlkIoWriteBlocks() and RamDiskBlkIoReadBlocks() in RamDiskDxe/RamDiskBlockIo.c do not correctly check the last block when writing/reading to/from a RamDisk that has a size not multiple of 512 bytes. An attacker may use this flaw by loading a maliciously crafted ramdisk and making the firmware overwrites area of memory beyond the intended buffer, causing system crashes or other unspecified effects.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-23 14:27:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0809 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0809](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0809)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-07 04:18:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:0968 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0968](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0968)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1683372#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-08 13:43:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1116 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1116](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1116)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-22 07:15:09 UTC  ``` Buffer overflows on the stack/heap are found in UDF-related codes under MdeModulePkg\Universal\Disk\PartitionDxe\Udf.c and MdeModulePkg\Universal\Disk\UdfDxe. The issue may be triggered with long file name (> 128 characters) or path name (> 256 characters) or with invalid formatted UDF media.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c1)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-22 07:18:00 UTC  ``` See [bug 1683404](show_bug.cgi?id=1683404 "CLOSED NOTABUG - edk2: stack buffer overflow in file/path name string check in UdfDxe/File.c"), [bug 1683410](show_bug.cgi?id=1683410 "CLOSED NOTABUG - edk2: stack buffer overflow in FindAnchorVolumeDescriptorPointer in PartitionDxe/Udf.c"), [bug 1683413](show_bug.cgi?id=1683413 "CLOSED NOTABUG - edk2: heap buffer overflow in ReadFile in UdfDxe/FileSystemOperations.c"), [bug 1683421](show_bug.cgi?id=1683421 "CLOSED NOTABUG - edk2: heap buffer overflow in LengthofComponentIdentifier in UdfDxe/FileSystemOperations.c"), [bug 1683425](show_bug.cgi?id=1683425 "CLOSED NOTABUG - edk2: heap buffer overflow in NumberOfPartitions in UdfDxe/FileSystemOperations.c").   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-22 07:20:39 UTC  ``` Upstream patches: <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/4df8f5bfa28b8b881e506437e8f08d92c1a00370> <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/b9ae1705adfdd43668027a25a2b03c2e81960219> <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/5c0748f43f4e1cc15fdd0be64a764eacd7df92f6> <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/89f75aa04a97293a8ed9db2a90851a5053730cf5> <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/3b30351b75d70ea65701ac999875fbb81a89a5ca>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-03-22 07:22:18 UTC  ``` Created edk2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1691646](show_bug.cgi?id=1691646 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-0160 edk2: buffer overflows in PartitionDxe and UdfDxe with long file names and invalid UDF media [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1691645](show_bug.cgi?id=1691645 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-0160 edk2: buffer overflows in PartitionDxe and UdfDxe with long file names and invalid UDF media [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c5)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-03-22 18:05:38 UTC  ``` Testing method for virt-QE:  Sanity checking is sufficient.  (1)   Install a new RHEL or Fedora guest from a Live or installer ISO.  (2)   Boot the installed system  (3.1) Partition a physical USB stick with MBR partition table format,       and create a single FAT32 partition on it. Copy a small text file       to the FAT32 filesystem. (You can use normal RHEL tools for this,       on the host.)  (3.2) Assign the USB stick with virtio-scsi "LUN passthrough" to the       guest.        <disk type='block' device='lun'>       <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/storage_vols#sect-Storage_Volumes-Adding_storage_devices_to_guests>        Note that you should assign the device node from the host system       that represents the entire USB stick, i.e. not just a partition of       it.  (3.3) Boot UefiShell.iso in the guest, and check with the TYPE shell       command whether the text file can be read. (For best results you       might have to use CRLF in the text file.)  (4.1) Add two ISO images to a domain configuration, UefiShell.iso and       some Windows installer ISO. In this example I use       "en_windows_server_2012_r2_x64_dvd_2707946.iso", but other Windows       media should work too.  (4.2) Add only UefiShell.iso to the boot order.  (4.3) In the UEFI Shell, run the MAP command. Locate the "FSx:" alias       whose UEFI device path ends with a       VenMedia(C5BD4D42-1A76-4996-8956-73CDA326CD0A) device path node.       For example:  > FS2: Alias(s):F0a1:;BLK8: >     PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)/Scsi(0x0,0x1)/VenMedia(C5BD4D42-1A76-4996-8956-73CDA326CD0A)  (4.4) Change to the filesystem in question, and list a file with the       TYPE command that is likely a text file. For example:  > Shell> fs2: > > FS2:\> dir > Directory of: FS2:\ > 08/22/2013  10:07       r         128  autorun.inf > 08/22/2013  10:07 <DIR> r         564  boot > 08/22/2013  10:07       r     427,680  bootmgr > 08/22/2013  10:07       r   1,612,128  bootmgr.efi > 08/22/2013  10:07 <DIR> r         148  efi > 08/22/2013  10:07       r      77,424  setup.exe > 08/22/2013  10:07 <DIR> r      13,128  sources > 08/22/2013  10:07 <DIR> r         252  support >           4 File(s)   2,117,360 bytes >           4 Dir(s) > > FS2:\> type autorun.inf > [AutoRun.Amd64] > open=setup.exe > icon=setup.exe,0 > > [AutoRun] > open=sources\SetupError.exe x64 > icon=sources\SetupError.exe,0 > > FS2:\>  Step (1) will regression-test ISO9960/ElTorito, when booting the ISO image.

Don't forget to unmount any filesystems located on the USB stick from the host, between steps (3.1) and (3.2).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c7)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-03-22 20:18:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laszlo Ersek from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c5))  > (3.3) Boot UefiShell.iso in the guest, and check with the TYPE shell >       command whether the text file can be read.

This is the right behavior, but for this test case we do want to see everything. Therefore, when the UEFI shell is reached, first run:    connect -r   map -r   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c8)  Michael    2019-05-15 09:02:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laszlo Ersek from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1691640#c5))  Hi Laszlo:  I am verifying [Bug 1691647](show_bug.cgi?id=1691647).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [edk2](/security/cves?package=edk2) - UEFI firmware for 64-bit x86 virtual machines

## Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in the network stack. An unprivileged user

could potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or denial of service.

This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04 LTS and 19.10.

([CVE-2018-12178](/security/CVE-2018-12178))

A buffer overflow was discovered in BlockIo service. An unauthenticated user

could potentially enable escalation of privilege, information disclosure and/or

denial of service. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04

LTS and 19.10. ([CVE-2018-12180](/security/CVE-2018-12180))

A stack overflow was discovered in bmp. An unprivileged user

could potentially enable denial of service or elevation of privilege via

local access. This issue was already fixed in a previous release for 18.04

LTS and 19.10. ([CVE-2018-12181](/security/CVE-2018-12181))

It was discovered that memory was not cleared before free that could lead

to potential password leak. ([CVE-2019-14558](/security/CVE-2019-14558))

A memory leak was discovered in ArpOnFrameRcvdDpc. An attacker could

possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified

impact. ([CVE-2019-14559](/security/CVE-2019-14559))

An integer overflow was discovered in MdeModulePkg/PiDxeS3BootScriptLib.

An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or

other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2019-14563](/security/CVE-2019-14563))

It was discovered that the affected version doesn't properly check whether an

unsigned EFI file should be allowed or not. An attacker could possibly load

unsafe content by bypassing the verification. ([CVE-2019-14575](/security/CVE-2019-14575))

It was discovered that original configuration runtime memory is freed, but it

is still exposed to the OS runtime. ([CVE-2019-14586](/security/CVE-2019-14586))

A double-unmap was discovered in TRB creation. An attacker could use it to

cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2019-14587](/security/CVE-2019-14587))

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The root cause is an interface contract that went wrong between QEMU and OVMF.  - In November 2015, a user reported the ticket "no pcie hotplug support for   q35/ovmf", in the then-bug-tracker for edk2; namely at   <<https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues/32>>.  - That bug tracker was torn down soon after, but I mirrored all OVMF bugs   faithfully (and manually) to the new bug tracker, so you can still read   through it at <<https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75>>.  - The relevant upstream thread is linked in   <<https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75#c25>>, namely   <<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.bios.edk2.devel/8707>>.  - Obviously, GMANE too has died since, so let me give you a working link to   that thread:    [edk2] [PATCH 0/5] OvmfPkg: enable PCIe on Q35   Message-Id: <1457102794-25499-1-git-send-email-lersek>   [https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel@lists.01.org/msg08570.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel%40lists.01.org/msg08570.html)  - Of particular interest for the interface contract is the discussion in the   sub-thread    Re: [edk2] [PATCH 2/5] OvmfPkg: PlatformPei: enable PCIEXBAR (aka MMCONFIG / ECAM) on Q35   Message-Id: <1457340448.25423.43.camel>   [https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel@lists.01.org/msg08682.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel%40lists.01.org/msg08682.html)    In that thread, we agreed that on Q35, QEMU would not map any RAM into the   [2GB, 3GB) GPA range. OVMF would program the EXBAR at 2GB, and the 32-bit   PCI MMIO aperture would start at 2GB+256MB.  - As a result, I posted the v2 series:    <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75#c27>   [edk2] [PATCH v2 0/6] OvmfPkg: enable PCIe on Q35   Message-Id: <1457446804-18892-1-git-send-email-lersek>   [https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel@lists.01.org/msg08743.html](https://www.mail-archive.com/edk2-devel%40lists.01.org/msg08743.html)  which was then merged as commit range 7e869eeb15b0..7daf2401d420.  - The relevant commits, which rely on the interface contract, are:    OvmfPkg: PlatformPei: lower the 32-bit PCI MMIO base to 2GB on Q35   <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/b01acf6ea7e7>    OvmfPkg: PlatformPei: enable PCIEXBAR (aka MMCONFIG / ECAM) on Q35   <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/7b8fe63561b4>  - The problem is that in reality, QEMU does not adhere to the interface   contract. It does place RAM into the [2GB, 3GB) GPA range. See   pc_q35_init() in "hw/i386/pc_q35.c":  >     /* Check whether RAM fits below 4G (leaving 1/2 GByte for IO memory >      * and 256 Mbytes for PCI Express Enhanced Configuration Access Mapping >      * also known as MMCFG). >      * If it doesn't, we need to split it in chunks below and above 4G. >      * In any case, try to make sure that guest addresses aligned at >      * 1G boundaries get mapped to host addresses aligned at 1G boundaries. >      */ >     if (machine->ram_size >= 0xb0000000) { >         lowmem = 0x80000000; >     } else { >         lowmem = 0xb0000000; >     } > >     /* Handle the machine opt max-ram-below-4g.

And that breaks the interface contract. OVMF maps the 256MB PCIEXBAR, and the start of the 32-bit PCI MMIO aperture, over the [2048MB, 2816MB) range, and Bad Things Happen (TM).  Unfortunately, I have no idea how to fix this. The Q35 memory split code is very complex, and I'm not sure what the firmware should do in the first place. I was happy that the contract was so simple. :(   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c2)  Gerd Hoffmann    2019-01-17 15:19:42 UTC  ``` > - The problem is that in reality, QEMU does not adhere to the interface >   contract.

Totally forgot this little detail. I'm kida surprised that it took *that* long to show up. Seems nobody uses VMs with odd memory sizes.  > >     /* Handle the machine opt max-ram-below-4g.

The Q35 memory split code is > very complex, and I'm not sure what the firmware should do in the first > place. I was happy that the contract was so simple. :(  Hmm, I think we should fix qemu to stop using lowmem = 0xb0000000.  Unfortunaly that'll work for new machine types only, for live migration compatibility reasons. So we could fix the rhel-8 q35 machine types but rhel-7 q35 machine types would stay broken.  Given that odd memory sizes seem to be used rarely in practice and we have a workaround (max-ram-below-4g=2G) this might still be good enough though.  If we want fix things on the edk2 side I'd suggest to move MMCFG as high as possible, i.e. use 0xe0000000 -> 0xefffffff range instead of 0x80000000 -> 0x8fffffff range. Advantage: we can stick to a fixed location.  Drawback: we'll have two windows for io then (end-of-ram -> 0xdfffffff and 0xf0000000 -> ioapic-base), but I think edk2 resource management can deal with that.  I hope the qemu acpi generator can handle it too.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c4)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-18 23:46:52 UTC  ``` Hi Gerd, thank you for the help!  Unfortunately, the edk2 PCI infrastructure cannot currently deal with discontiguous MMIO apertures. The interface through which a platform expresses the MMIO apertures for a specific root bridge is    MdeModulePkg/Include/Library/PciHostBridgeLib.h  and it only offers (under 4GB):    PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE_APERTURE Mem;                   ///< MMIO aperture below 4GB which can be used by the root bridge.   PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE_APERTURE PMem;                  ///< Prefetchable MMIO aperture below 4GB which can be used by the root bridge.  in the PCI_ROOT_BRIDGE structure.  The platform is supposed to: - implement a PciHostBridgeLib instance in the platform-specific way, - build "MdeModulePkg/Bus/Pci/PciHostBridgeDxe/PciHostBridgeDxe.inf" in the platform DSC file, - hook the platform's PciHostBridgeLib instance into PciHostBridgeDxe.  Then PciHostBridgeDxe calls into the platforms PciHostBridgeLib instance (the PciHostBridgeGetRootBridges() function), and gets the root bridges with their apertures from platform-specific code.  In OVMF, the lib instance lives at "OvmfPkg/Library/PciHostBridgeLib", and it relies on dynamic PCDs that OvmfPkg/PlatformPei sets during the PEI phase. All root bridges share the same apertures (one per bitness).  ... The reason that PlatformPei handles this information, as very first agent in the firmware, is that the MMIO apertures affect the layout / size of the full address space, and dealing with that belongs in PlatformPei.  Anyway, here's what I suggest, as "action items": - We should fix this as soon as we can, for the next available machine type. Honestly, I'd like to punt this part to you. :) - I should test whether max-ram-below-4g=2G helps. Setting needinfo on myself for that. - If it helps, we should update the RHEL documentation and explain that these memory sizes should not be used -- add a Known Issue. In practice, I think their impact is nil; nobody really uses such memory sizes.  Sound good?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c6)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-19 00:12:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laszlo Ersek from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c4)) > - I should test whether max-ram-below-4g=2G helps.

In practice, I > think their impact is nil; nobody really uses such memory sizes.  Sorry, I was unclear. I meant that we should document the Known Issue either way, and if "max-ram-below-4g=2G" works it around, then document the workaround as well.  However... we only support QEMU usage through libvirt, and I don't think libvirt exposes this knob. And hooking it in with <qemu:arg> taints the domain and makes it unsupportable again. So I guess we can't really fix it for old machine types.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c7)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-21 14:56:55 UTC  ``` Gerd, how about this:  - Move the exbar base to fixed 0xe000_0000. - Write off the GPA range [0xf000_0000, 0xfc00_0000), as unusable for 32-bit PCI MMIO aperture. - Use the [TopOfLowRam, 0xe000_0000) range as 32-bit PCI MMIO aperture. (This would change the relative order of the 32-bit aperture and the exbar.)  Comparing the cases when the 32-bit window is largest: - Currently OVMF exposes [0x9000_0000, 0xfc00_0000); that is, 0x6c00_0000 == 1728 MB. - With the suggested change, OVMF would expose [0x8000_0000, 0xe000_0000] == 1536 MB (192 MB less).  In other words, we would trade - 192MB of the 32-bit aperture, in the common "much RAM" case, - for arbitrary RAM size support, in the uncommon "not much RAM" case.  Is it worth it?  Also, the change would be guest visible, if a guest were forward-migrated and then rebooted on the target host (which had a more recent OVMF).  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c9)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-21 21:06:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laszlo Ersek from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c4))  > - I should test whether max-ram-below-4g=2G helps.

I wrote above, "with the following addition".  I meant that you should please *add* the option to everything else that you already have on the command line.  In particular, the addition was not supposed to *replace* the Q35 machine type. The option was supposed to set a machine property *for* the Q35 machine type, not to replace the Q35 machine type.  In all three of your scenarios, QEMU ended up using the "pc" machine type.  In scenario [2], you get a black screen because OVMF simply doesn't boot on the "pc" (i440fx) machine type. Although you wrote "The result is same with comments#0", in reality that only applies to the end-user-visible symptom ("black screen"); internally, the problem is entirely different.  Similarly, in scenario [3], QEMU complains about not finding the "pcie.0" bus because, i440fx has none.  Can you please repeat the test with the "max-ram-below-4g=2G" machine property added to everything else on the command line? For this, it is possible to  (a) use two -machine options, such as:    -machine q35,[other options you usually have here] \   -machine max-ram-below-4g=2G \  (b) or identically, use a single merged -machine option, such as:    -machine q35,[other options you usually have here],max-ram-below-4g=2G  The reason that I couldn't immediately recommend a merged "-machine" option was that [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c0) doesn't contain a QEMU command line, so I couldn't modify it. I could only suggest to add (= append) "-machine max-ram-below-4g=2G".  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c13)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-22 21:32:44 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, I think we *really* cannot fix this. Not the "PCIEXBAR vs. low RAM" mapping issue specifically, but the general "failure to boot OVMF with arbitrary small RAM sizes" issue.  I've now written a small series to address the first issue (i.e., for moving the EXBAR to 0xE000_0000, and to move the 32-bit PCI hole below it). I wrote a super-detailed commit message for the last patch (the main one), and then I prepared to start testing all the boundary conditions that I described in that patch. That was when I (re-)discovered the real mess.  Note that [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c0) does not carry an OVMF debug log, so we can't precisely tell what the issue was. The scenario we've discussed thus far is valid, and a RAM size strictly larger than 2048MB and strictly smaller than 2816MB *may* indeed fail the following assertion:        ASSERT (TopOfLowRam <= PciExBarBase);  in MemMapInitialization() [OvmfPkg/PlatformPei/Platform.c].  However, [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c0) also mentions RAM size 1025MB as a trigger, not just 2049MB. And RAM size 1025MB falls entirely outside of the discussion thus far; it does not interfere with the PCIEXBAR at 2GB. Instead, we have a different assertion failure in that case:  > ASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status = Out of Resources) > ASSERT OvmfPkg/PlatformPei/MemDetect.c(702): !EFI_ERROR (Status)  which refers to the following code in QemuInitializeRam():  >     // >     // Set memory range from the "top of lower RAM" (RAM below 4GB) to 4GB as >     // uncacheable >     // >     Status = MtrrSetMemoryAttribute (LowerMemorySize, >                SIZE_4GB - LowerMemorySize, CacheUncacheable); >     ASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status);  The MTRR library in edk2 (UefiCpuPkg/Library/MtrrLib/) implements a complex algorithm for determining optimal utilization for the fixed and variable memory type range registers. In some cases however, there simply aren't enough registers available for splitting the specified address space into power-of-two sized masks, such that the requested coverage be produced precisely. In those cases, MtrrSetMemoryAttribute() fails.  And this code in OVMF is already the result of a painful struggle; please see:    <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/79d274b8b6b1>  In that commit, we ensured that any particular *large* guest RAM size would be well covered by MTRR (which was in turn required by the Linux guest!), however, in exchange, we had to give up coverage for many small RAM sizes.  And, now I believe that said general theme applies to the prior discussion too. Large RAM sizes are more likely, and in those cases, QEMU will also set the 32-bit RAM split at 2GB, and things will just work.  If customers care much for small guests, we should likely determine a limited set of well-working "small instance sizes", and document those. For example, the following all work for me: - 512 MB - 768 MB - 1024 MB - 1536 MB - 2048 MB - 3072 MB - 4096 MB  It pains me, but I have to close this BZ now as CANTFIX. I'm really sorry. If necessary, please open a new BZ for the virt docs.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c14)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-01-22 21:36:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1522513](attachment.cgi?id=1522513 "reorder the 32-bit PCI hole vs. the  PCIEXBAR on q35 (tarball of INSUFFICIENT edk2 patches)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1522513&action=edit "reorder the 32-bit PCI hole vs. the  PCIEXBAR on q35 (tarball of INSUFFICIENT edk2 patches)") reorder the 32-bit PCI hole vs. the  PCIEXBAR on q35 (tarball of INSUFFICIENT edk2 patches)  For posterity, I'm attaching the patches I've written for the PCIEXBAR <-> TopOfLowRam issue.

It would only help in a subset of the problematic cases. There are multiple issues when the VM RAM size is smaller than 2816 MB, and the machine property in question would help with only some of them. In addition, you would be testing something that libvirt doesn't currently expose.  Instead, please document this BZ as a known issue in your test plans, and whenever you need a "small guest", use one of the RAM sizes from the end of [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c13).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c0)  Andrew Jones    2019-05-28 07:11:37 UTC  ``` Paraphrasing (well, mostly quoting) Laszlo:  A downstream-only regression from the latest rebase ([bug 1687731](show_bug.cgi?id=1687731 "CLOSED ERRATA - rebase edk2 to upstream tag edk2-stable201903 for RHEL-8.1")) has been introduced. The regression comes from downstream commit 76b4ac28e975 ("ArmVirtPkg: silence DEBUG_VERBOSE (0x00400000) in QemuRamfbDxe (RH only)", 2019-03-20).  The problem is that the commit doesn't only clear the DEBUG_VERBOSE bit, it also unconditionally sets some other bits, which we normally keep clear in the "silent" build.  To fix up this downstream-only commit we need to replace the    0x8000004F  constant it added, with    ($(DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL) & 0xFFBFFFFF)  Because we build the "silent" binary with    -D DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL=0x80000000   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c1)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-05-28 09:42:36 UTC  ``` To refine the suggested syntax: we should likely write:        gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|($(DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL)) & 0xFFBFFFFF  Because: the edk2 DSC spec at <<https://edk2-docs.gitbooks.io/edk-ii-dsc-specification/content/2_dsc_overview/22_build_description_file_format.html#table-3-using-system-environment-variable>> provides the following example:  [LibraryClasses.X64, LibraryClasses.IA32]   DEFINE PERF = PerformancePkg/Library   TimerLib|$(PERF)/DxeTscTimerLib/DxeTscTimerLib.inf  This implies that macro expansion doesn't (mustn't) automatically wrap the replacement text in parentheses. And therefore, in preparation for "tricky" values in DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL, we should tightly enclose $(DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL) in parens.  Furthermore, an outermost set of parens doesn't look necessary (the PCD setting syntax doesn't appear to require it).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c4)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-07-26 16:01:57 UTC  ``` Here's a summary of the rhvirt-patches review discussion (linked in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c3)):  (1) The patch, as posted, uses the mask ~0x00400000 for clearing the DEBUG_VERBOSE bit. Using the bitwise-complement operator for setting PCDs in the DSC is not recommended. The edk2 DSC spec refers (somewhat vaguely) to the C standard when it specifies such PCD assignments. In C, on all platforms that we care about, (~0x00400000) leads to flipping the sign bit in a signed integer. We should avoid that. If we could write (~0x00400000u), that would be fine, but my understanding is that the DSC spec does not permit that. I suggest using 0xFFBFFFFF as mask, explicitly. (This C language constant has type "unsigned int" on all platforms that we care about.)  (2) There are two new log messages that the patch does not suppress:  - "Error: Image at 00047505000 start failed: Not Found" - "remove-symbol-file ..."  Suppressing each of these will require a dedicated patch; see below:  (2.1) The first message comes from the DXE Core. It can only be suppressed with downstream-only changes, as printing the message at DEBUG_ERROR level is the right thing for the DXE Core otherwise, and it is also right for QemuRamfbDxe to exit with an error under the given circumstances. Options:  (2.1.1) Downgrade the log mask to DEBUG_WARN in the DXE Core. Bad idea, we'd lose valuable reports of driver startup failures.  (2.1.2) Change QemuRamfbDxe to return EFI_SUCCESS even when it fails (e.g. ramfb is not configured). Wastes some memory (driver stays resident without any good use), but it is mostly harmless, as the memory is released by the OS after ExitBootServices().  (2.1.3) Replace "-D DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL=0x80000000" in the spec file with "-D DEBUG_PRINT_ERROR_LEVEL=0x0". This will suppress *all* debug messages (even errors). Not ideal because (a) it allows errors to "snowball" (we could notice an issue only much later, from behavioral problems), (b) it makes the "silent" firmware binary entirely unsuitable for bug reporting and triaging, (c) it prevents us from cleaning up new debug messages up-stream that are needlessly logged at DEBUG_ERROR level.  (2.2) The second message should be downgraded to DEBUG_INFO level, with an upstream patch, similarly to upstream commit 1fce963d89f3 ("ArmPkg: DebugPeCoffExtraActionLib: debugger commands are not errors", 2015-03-02). This upstream patch should be backported then.   My recommendation is a series of 3 patches: - patch #1: what was posted already (downstream-only patch), but replace             ~0x00400000 with 0xFFBFFFFF - patch #2: downstream-only patch implementing (2.1.2) - patch #3: backport of new upstream patch implementing (2.2)  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c5)  Andrew Jones    2019-07-27 09:53:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Laszlo Ersek from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c4)) > My recommendation is a series of 3 patches: > - patch #1: what was posted already (downstream-only patch), but replace >             ~0x00400000 with 0xFFBFFFFF > - patch #2: downstream-only patch implementing (2.1.2)  Yes, I prefer 2.1.2 as well.  > - patch #3: backport of new upstream patch implementing (2.2) >  > Thanks!  Thanks, drew   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c6)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-07-30 16:51:14 UTC  ``` For (2.2), Phil posted:  [edk2-devel] [PATCH 0/2] ArmPkg: DebugPeCoffExtraActionLib: debugger                          commands are not errors [http://mid.mail-archive.com/20190729180321.1715-1-philmd@redhat.com](http://mid.mail-archive.com/20190729180321.1715-1-philmd%40redhat.com) <https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/44569>  Pushed by Leif as commit range 8fed4e47d9a6..3d34b5f32692:  1 a6cd7fbac494 ArmPkg: DebugPeCoffExtraActionLib: debugger commands are                not errors 2 3d34b5f32692 ArmPkg: DebugPeCoffExtraActionLib: fix trivial comment                typos   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1714446#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 20:44:44 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
