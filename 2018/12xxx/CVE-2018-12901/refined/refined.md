- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ST 14.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary script or HTML code into a user's browser, potentially leading to exposure of user information.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a malicious link to a user. If the user clicks the link, the attacker's script is executed in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link and convince the user to click it. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
