  "CVE-2018-12383": {
    "Description": "If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Unencrypted storage of passwords"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of stored password data.",
    "Attack Vectors": [
      "Local access to user's profile directory."
    ],
    "Required Capabilities": [
      "Local access to user's file system."
    ]
  },
 "CVE-2018-12385": {
    "Description": "A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Crash in `TransportSecurityInfo`",
      "Use of cached data in an unsafe manner."
    ],
    "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crash, or denial of service. Potentially arbitrary code execution if combined with a vulnerability that allows writing to local cache.",
     "Attack Vectors": [
       "Writing data to the local cache through another vulnerability or locally installed malware."
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Ability to write data into the local cache",
         "Or locally installed malware"

"CVE-2018-12382": {
  "Description": "The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Address bar spoofing."
      ],
      "Impact": "User confusion due to the spoofed address bar.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Specially crafted `javascript:` URI."

      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Ability to craft a specific `javascript:` URI and load it into the address bar."
      ]
    },
"CVE-2018-12379":{
      "Description": "When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability"

 "CVE-2018-12376": {
      "Description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Memory safety bugs, memory corruption."
