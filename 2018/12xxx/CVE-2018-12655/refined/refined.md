The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Circulation module of the SLIMS8 Akasia software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "keywords" parameter of the loan_rules.php page before reflecting it back in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
- This can be used to:
    - Steal session cookies of logged-in administrators.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites (potentially containing malware).
    - Force the download of malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the `keywords` parameter.
- The victim (administrator) visits the crafted URL while logged in.
- The vulnerable application reflects the malicious script in the response.
- The victim's browser executes the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to visit the crafted URL (e.g., through phishing or social engineering).
