The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the ASUSTOR AS-602T NAS device, and one of them is indeed CVE-2018-12312.

**CVE-2018-12312 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization of the `secret_key` URL parameter when setting up two-factor authentication for a user account.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `secret_key` parameter, intended for two-factor authentication setup, is not properly validated before being passed to the shell. This allows for command injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with the ability to create new user accounts can execute arbitrary system commands as root by injecting malicious commands into the `secret_key` parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/portal/apis/accessControl/user.cgi` with the `act=set_two_step_auth` parameter, and injecting a malicious payload into the `secret_key` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create user accounts on the NAS device.
