Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2018-12975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used by the Cryptosaga game on the Ethereum blockchain. The game uses `block.blockhash(block.number)`, `seed` (a private variable), and `now` (timestamp) to generate random numbers that determine hero classes. The `block.blockhash(block.number)` will always return 0 since it is called with the current block number, which is not supported by the solidity function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Randomness:** The PRNG relies on values that are either predictable or accessible. Specifically:
    *   `block.blockhash(block.number)` always returns 0 in the context of the current block.
    *   The `seed` is a private variable stored in the contract storage, which can be read using `web3.eth.StorageAt()`.
    *   `now` (timestamp) is predictable, although not with perfect precision.
*   **Use of Private Variable in PRNG:** The inclusion of a private storage variable, `seed`, as an input to PRNG makes the sequence of numbers predictable.
*   **Incorrect Usage of `blockhash()`:**  The game uses `block.blockhash(block.number)` which will always be '0', as it is called for the current block which is an invalid use of blockhash().

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Creation of Legendary Heroes:** By predicting the output of the PRNG, an attacker can manipulate the timing of their transaction to generate legendary heroes, which have higher value and/or in-game advantages.
*   **Economic Advantage:** The ability to create legendary heroes gives an unfair advantage to the attacker and disrupts the game's economy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Smart Contract Interaction:** The attack involves creating a smart contract that calls the vulnerable game's function (`payWithEth()`) at specific timestamps to generate legendary heroes.
*   **Timing Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the transaction execution time (using a custom contract that reverts if the timestamp is not correct) to align with predicted PRNG outputs. This attack requires some luck and many attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ethereum Knowledge:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and smart contracts.
*   **Web3/Ethereum Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using tools like `web3.js`.
*   **Ability to Deploy Contracts:** The attacker needs to deploy a malicious contract to interact with the target contract.
*   **Contract Storage Access:** The attacker needs to access contract storage to read private variables (e.g., using `web3.eth.getStorageAt`).
*   **Timing Control:** The attacker needs to control (or at least influence) the timing of transaction execution.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content explains in details how the random number is generated and how to predict the outcome to generate a legendary hero. The attacker uses a smart contract to call the vulnerable function at a specific timestamp, however it requires many trials to succeed as the timestamp needs to match the prediction.
