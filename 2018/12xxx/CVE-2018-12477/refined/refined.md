{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `obs-service-refresh_patches` service used `ls` and `grep` commands to determine directories created during a quilt unpack process. This method was vulnerable to injection of newlines, allowing an attacker to manipulate the output.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create a specially formatted archive (e.g., tarball) that includes directory entries with newlines (e.g., ` ..\\nsomedir`). This would trick the service into recognizing `..` as a created directory, causing `shutil.rmtree()` to potentially remove unrelated directories and files.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted archive file with directory entries containing newlines.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious archive and have it processed by the vulnerable service."
