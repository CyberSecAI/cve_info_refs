| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-12 14:08:40 UTC  ``` The refresh_patches service uses the following line to determine existing directories in the CWD:      silent_popen("ls -l | grep '^d' | awk '{print $9}'", shell=True).strip().split("\n")  It is used to determine which directory was created as a result of the quilt unpack process. This kind of parsing the directories is prone to injection of newlines, however.  For example adding a directory entry " ..\nsomedir" into a tarball will result in the above line to recognize ".." as the created directory. Due to a following `shutil.rmtree(...)` this might result in removal of unexpected files.  Instead of using the shell logic above, os.listdir() or a single iteration of os.walk() should be used. This avoids any tricks like the one explained here. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c2)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2018-09-17 09:37:35 UTC  ``` Didnt even have the git repo, because I never did a patch so far. CCing vuntz to review <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-refresh_patches/pull/6> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c3)  Vincent Untz   2018-09-17 11:50:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bernhard Wiedemann from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c2)) > Didnt even have the git repo, because I never did a patch so far. > CCing vuntz to review > <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-refresh_patches/pull/6>  Now merged by Daniel 5 minutes ago. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-09-17 15:21:27 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1108189) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/636202> 15.0+42.3+Backports:SLE-15 / obs-service-refresh_patches <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/636203> Factory / obs-service-refresh_patches ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1108189#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-20 14:37:50 UTC  ``` I also just had a look at the code and it looks good.
