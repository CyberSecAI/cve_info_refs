Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that log files are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`Data/Log/`) and are named using a predictable date format (year_month_day.log).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The main weakness is the lack of access control on the log files.
- **Predictable Resource Location:** The naming convention of the log files makes them easily discoverable by simply guessing dates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers can download all log files containing sensitive information about the web application, potentially including error messages, debug information, user activity, database queries, and more.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** The attacker directly accesses the log files through their URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know or guess the log file naming convention.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was identified in GreenCMS version 2.3.0603.
- The issue was reported by vr\_system.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to access the log files using a predictable date format.
- The recommended remediation is to strengthen the complexity of log file names.
- The exploit-db entry provides a concise summary of the vulnerability and the proof of concept.
