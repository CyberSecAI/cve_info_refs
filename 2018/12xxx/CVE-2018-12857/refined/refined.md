Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12857:

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-12857 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, which could lead to information disclosure.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the software. This occurs when the application attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer, potentially leading to sensitive data being leaked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads memory outside the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Information disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in memory, including potentially other users data or system information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted file. While the specific file type isn't explicitly mentioned, it is likely a malicious PDF file or one containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image, given the context from the checkpoint article.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious PDF file or a file containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image to the target user and have it opened with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional details from Checkpoint Research article:**

- The Checkpoint article explains their methodology for discovering multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-12857, using fuzzing techniques against Adobe Reader. They targeted the JP2KLib.dll library, which handles the JPEG2000 image format, for their initial fuzzing efforts.
- They also describe how they crafted a harness to target specific functions within the library, which allowed them to fuzz the library in a more controlled and efficient manner. This involved reverse engineering the library, identifying the API entry points they needed to target and creating their own custom functions to mimic the expected behavior of the library.
- The article also outlines steps for fuzzing, such as setting up an environment, initial tests, corpus creation and minimization, coverage analysis and triage.

- The checkpoint article revealed that CVE-2018-12857 was one of 53 critical bugs found during their 50 day fuzzing research project, which indicates this vulnerability is part of a larger group of security flaws in Adobe Reader.
