**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20181112-0001
**Version:**
7.0

**Last updated:**
11/18/2020

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2018-12037, CVE-2018-12038

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products contain Self-Encrypting Solid State Drives. Researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands reported multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of ATA Security and TCG Opal Standards in Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs) which can allow an attacker with physical access to the drive and instrumented hardware and firmware to decrypt the contents of an encrypted drive.

#### Impact

ONTAP, SANtricity and StorageGRID based products do not support any of the drive models referenced within the paper from the researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker with physical access to the drive and instrumented hardware and firmware to decrypt the contents of an encrypted drive.

## Self-encrypting hard drives do not adequately protect data

#### Vulnerability Note VU#395981

Original Release Date: 2018-11-06 | Last Revised: 2019-11-14

---

### Overview

There are multiple vulnerabilities in implementations of ATA Security or TCG Opal Standards in Self-Encrypting Disks (SEDs), which can allow an attacker to decrypt contents of an encrypted drive.

### Description

| [**CVE-2018-12037**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12037)  There is no cryptographic relation between the password provided by the end user and the key used for the encryption of user data. This can allow an attacker to access the key without knowing the password provided by the end user, allowing the attacker to decrypt information encrypted with that key.According to National Cyber Security Centre - The Netherlands (NCSC-NL), the following products are affected by CVE-2018-12037:   * Crucial (Micron) MX100, MX200 and MX300 drives * Samsung T3 and T5 portable drives * Samsung 840 EVO and 850 EVO drives (In "ATA high" mode these devices are vulnerable, In "TCG" or "ATA max" mode these devices are NOT vulnerable.)  [**CVE-2018-12038**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12038)Key information is stored within a wear-leveled storage chip. Wear-leveling does not guarantee that an old copy of updated data is fully removed. If the updated data is written to a new segment, old versions of data may exist in the previous segment for some time after it has been updated (until that previous segment is overwritten). This means that if a key is updated with a new password, the previous version of the key (either unprotected, or with an old password) could be accessible, negating the need to know the updated password.According to NCSC-NL, the following products are affected by CVE-2018-12038:  * Samsung 840 EVO drives  Other products were not reported to have been tested, and similar vulnerabilities may be found in those products. |
| --- |

### Impact

| These vulnerabilities allow for full recovery of the data without knowledge of any secret, when the attacker has physical access to the drive. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches**Vendors have issued patches to address the vulnerabilities. See the Vendor pages below for additional information. |
| --- |

| If patches are not able to be deployed, consider the following workarounds:**Do not use drive-based encryption**Use software-based encryption rather than the hardware-based encryption provided by self-encrypting drives.  **Additional Information:**According to NCSC-NL, BitLocker as bundled with Microsoft Windows relies on hardware full-disk encryption by default if the drive indicates that it can support this.To determine whether BitLocker is using hardware-based encryption or software-based encryption:   * Run "manage-bde.exe -status" in an administrator command prompt. * If the "Encryption Method" starts with "Hardware Encryption", then BitLocker is using the self-encrypting disk's hardware-based encryption implementation. * If the "Encryption Method" states something other than "Hardware Encryption", such as "AES-128" or "XTS AES-256", then BitLocker is using software-based encryption.   BitLocker's default encryption method can be controlled with Group Policy settings. Configure these settings to force BitLocker to use software-based encryption by default. Once these policy settings have been changed, BitLocker needs to be disabled and re-enabled to re-encrypt the drive with software-based encryption (if not already using software-based encryption).  Group policy links to control hardware-based BitLocker encryption:   * Fixed data drives: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings#bkmk-hdefxd> * OS drives: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings#bkmk-hdeosd> * Removable drives: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings#bkmk-hderdd> |

### [Microsoft](#LTYS-B68MKA) Affected

Updated:  November 07, 2018

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Encryption with BitLocker depends on the correct setting of the Group Policy. More information about this Group Policy can be found via the following location (Microsoft URL). Changing the default setting is not sufficient to mitigate the risk because it does not affect the vulnerability in already encrypted data. Only a complete new installation, including removal and reformatting of data, enforces encryption via BitLocker.

### Vendor Statement

Self-Encrypting Solid-State Drive Research Study: VU#395981, CVE-2018-12037,
CVE-2018-12038

All Seagate Secure™ TCG Enterprise SSC and TCG Opal SSC based SED and FIPS
devices across all interfaces (SAS, SATA and NVMe) provide certified
mitigations to the threats referenced in the recent research study entitled
"Self-encrypting deception: weaknesses in the encryption of solid-state drives
(SSDs)" by Carlo Meijer and Bernard van Gastel at Radboud University in the
Netherlands. Specifically, the threats referenced in this study are:

Password and DEK not linked
Single DEK used for the entire disk
Lack of entropy in randomly generated DEKs
Wear leveling, power-saving mode (e.g. DEVSLP)
General implementation issues (i.e. incorrect crypto usage)
JTAG access
Vendor diagnostic commands access
Arbitrary unsigned code execution, and
Same intermediate encryption key for all MEKs

These threats are addressed in Seagate Secure SED and FIPS devices which are
thoroughly validated by independent labs that certify Seagate Secure products
against the FIPS 140 Standard and Common Criteria FDE Encryption Engine profile.

Seagate leads the industry with security certifications and transparency as a
result of our FIPS 140 and Common Criteria Certificates and corresponding
Seagate Secure Security Policies. These certifications provide public
visibility to the implemented security policies and assurance that device
protection, cryptography and key management are implemented to publicly
recognized security standards.

Common Criteria Certificate - CCEVS-VR-VID10857-2018
FIPS 140 Certificate Examples - #3316, #3252, #2634 (Refer to Seagate website
for additional certificates)
