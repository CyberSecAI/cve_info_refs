The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-12305. Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:

**CVE-2018-12305: Cross-Site Scripting via SVG Images**

*   **Root Cause:** The File Explorer feature in the web interface allows users to upload and view files. The system doesn't properly sanitize SVG files.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the File Explorer, allowing the inclusion of malicious JavaScript within these files. The system also sends session tokens in the URL, enabling attackers to steal authentication data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file disguised as a `.png` image containing embedded JavaScript. When a user previews this file, the malicious script executes in the user's browser, allowing for actions such as stealing session tokens and potentially other malicious actions within the context of the web application.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG image with embedded JavaScript using the File Explorer. The attack is triggered when a victim user previews this image using the "Preview in new Window" feature.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the NAS through the web interface.
