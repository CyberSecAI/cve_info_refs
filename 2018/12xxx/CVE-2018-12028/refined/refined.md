The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12028.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from issues in SpawningKit, a subsystem within Passenger responsible for spawning application processes. This subsystem introduced new vulnerabilities in version 5.3.0 due to a major overhaul.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Race conditions allow a malicious application to cause Passenger to connect to arbitrary sockets by manipulating symlinks.
- Reads and writes to arbitrary file paths could be induced by replacing path elements with symlinks.
- Vulnerability exists in how Passenger handles PID reporting by a preloader.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Denial of Service (DoS) on the system by incorrectly reporting a PID and causing Passenger to kill it.
- Local privilege escalation through induced reads and writes to arbitrary file paths.
- Local information disclosure by manipulating the app socket directory.
- Traffic hijacking by forcing Passenger to connect to a process not belonging to the app user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting race conditions through symlink manipulation.
- Manipulating socket directories and their parent directories.
- Incorrect PID reporting by a malicious application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be a malicious user on the same system as the vulnerable Passenger instance.
- Ability to run an application managed by the vulnerable Passenger instance.
- Ability to create and manipulate symlinks.
- Ability to manipulate directory permissions if targeting the socket directory vulnerability.
