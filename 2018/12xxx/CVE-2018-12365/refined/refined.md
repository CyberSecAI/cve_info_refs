Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A compromised IPC (Inter-Process Communication) child process in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird can escape the content sandbox. 
*   This allows the compromised child process to list the names of arbitrary files on the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The content sandbox is not adequately isolating the IPC child process, allowing it to access the file system.
*   **Lack of User Consent/Interaction:** The compromised process can perform file listing operations without any user consent or interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of private local files by listing their names.
*   In the worst case, could lead to leaking the content of files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A compromised IPC child process is the attack vector. This could occur through various means such as a malicious website or a compromised plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromised IPC Child Process:** The attacker must have already compromised an IPC child process within Firefox or Thunderbird. This could be achieved through a variety of methods and may require previous exploits.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `GetFilesRequest` IPC method of `PContentParent` class, as described in the Mozilla source code at `dom/ipc/ContentParent.cpp`.
*   The fix involves restricting file access using the `FileSystemSecurity` component and checking for access rights.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Firefox and Thunderbird and affects multiple operating systems.
*   Red Hat also mentions that a compromised IPC child process can list local filenames.
*   The issue is rated as moderate severity by Mozilla.
*   The issue is resolved in Firefox ESR 52.9, Firefox ESR 60.1, Firefox 61 and Thunderbird 52.9 and 60.
