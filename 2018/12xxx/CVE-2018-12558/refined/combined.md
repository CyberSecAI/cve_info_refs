# NAME

Email::Address - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

# VERSION

version 1.913

# SYNOPSIS

```
use Email::Address;

my @addresses = Email::Address->parse($line);
my $address   = Email::Address->new(Casey => 'casey@localhost');

print $address->format;
```
# DESCRIPTION

This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email addresses in strings and returns a list of `Email::Address` objects found. Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of this software is to be correct, and very very fast.

Version 1.909 and earlier of this module had vulnerabilies ([CVE-2015-7686](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686)) and ([CVE-2015-12558](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12558)) which allowed specially constructed email to cause a denial of service. The reported vulnerabilities and some other pathalogical cases (meaning they really shouldn't occur in normal email) have been addressed in version 1.910 and newer. If you're running version 1.909 or older, you should update!

Alternatively, you could switch to [**Email::Address::XS**](/pod/Email%3A%3AAddress%3A%3AXS) which has a backward compatible API. **Why not just use that?**

## Package Variables

**ACHTUNG!** Email isn't easy (if even possible) to parse with a regex, *at least* if you're on a `perl` prior to 5.10.0. Providing regular expressions for use by other programs isn't a great idea, because it makes it hard to improve the parser without breaking the "it's a regex" feature. Using these regular expressions is not encouraged, and methods like `Email::Address->is_addr_spec` should be provided in the future.

Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others. For convenience, these variables are declared as package variables that you may access from your program.

These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in RFC 2822.

You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want short names, define them yourself.

```
my $addr_spec = $Email::Address::addr_spec;
```
$Email::Address::addr\_spec

This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to look like.

$Email::Address::angle\_addr

This regular expression defines an `$addr_spec` wrapped in angle brackets.

$Email::Address::name\_addr

This regular expression defines what an email address can look like with an optional preceding display name, also known as the `phrase`.

$Email::Address::mailbox

This is the complete regular expression defining an RFC 2822 email address with an optional preceding display name and optional following comment.

## Class Methods

parse
```
my @addrs = Email::Address->parse(
  q[me@local, Casey <me@local>, "Casey" <me@local> (West)]
);
```

This method returns a list of `Email::Address` objects it finds in the input string. **Please note** that it returns a list, and expects that it may find multiple addresses. The behavior in scalar context is undefined.

The specification for an email address allows for infinitely nestable comments. That's nice in theory, but a little over done. By default this module allows for one (`1`) level of nested comments. If you think you need more, modify the `$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL` package variable to allow more.

```
$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I'm deep
```

The reason for this hardly-limiting limitation is simple: efficiency.

Long strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to parse, a bug which has not yet been adequately addressed. The default behavior is now to collapse multiple spaces into a single space, which avoids this problem. To prevent this behavior, set `$Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES` to zero. This variable will go away when the bug is resolved properly.

In accordance with RFC 822 and its descendants, this module demands that email addresses be ASCII only. Any non-ASCII content in the parsed addresses will cause the parser to return no results.

new
```
my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local');
my $address = Email::Address->new('Casey West', 'casey@local');
my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local', '(Casey)');
```

Constructs and returns a new `Email::Address` object. Takes four positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment, and original string.

The original string should only really be set using `parse`.

purge\_cache
```
Email::Address->purge_cache;
```

One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live in memory and there is the remote possibility that you will have a memory problem. On the off chance that you think you're one of those people, this class method will empty those caches.

I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory problem.

disable\_cache

enable\_cache
```
Email::Address->disable_cache if memory_low();
```

If you'd rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable (and re-enable) the Email::Address cache with these methods. The cache is enabled by default.

## Instance Methods

phrase
```
my $phrase = $address->phrase;
$address->phrase( "Me oh my" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the phrase portion of an address.

address
```
my $addr = $address->address;
$addr->address( "me@PROTECTED.com" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the address portion of an address.

comment
```
my $comment = $address->comment;
$address->comment( "(Work address)" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the comment portion of an address.

original
```
my $orig = $address->original;
```

Accessor for the original address found when parsing, or passed to `new`.

host
```
my $host = $address->host;
```

Accessor for the host portion of an address's address.

user
```
my $user = $address->user;
```

Accessor for the user portion of an address's address.

format
```
my $printable = $address->format;
```

Returns a properly formatted RFC 2822 address representing the object.

name
```
my $name = $address->name;
```

This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the address. First the `phrase` is checked. If that doesn't work out the `comment` is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the `user` portion of the `address` is returned.

This method does **not** try to massage any name it identifies and instead leaves that up to someone else. Who is it to decide if someone wants their name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

## Overloaded Operators

stringify
```
print "I have your email address, $address.";
```

Objects stringify to `format` by default. It's possible that you don't like that idea. Okay, then, you can change it by modifying `$Email:Address::STRINGIFY`. Please consider modifying this package variable using `local`. You might step on someone else's toes if you don't.

```
{
  local $Email::Address::STRINGIFY = 'host';
  print "I have your address, $address.";
  #   geeknest.com
}
print "I have your address, $address.";

Modifying this package variable is now deprecated. Subclassing is now the recommended approach.

## Did I Mention Fast?

On his 1.8GHz Apple MacBook, rjbs gets these results:

```
$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 5
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.59/s             --           -44%
Email::Address 4.59/s            77%             --

$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 25
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.58/s             --           -67%
Email::Address 7.84/s           204%             --

$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 50
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.57/s             --           -70%
Email::Address 8.53/s           232%             --
```

...unfortunately, a known bug causes a loss of speed the string to parse has certain known characteristics, and disabling cache will also degrade performance.

# PERL VERSION

This library should run on perls released even a long time ago. It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased. The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

Vulnerable are all applications which receive (untrusted) emails and

# NAME

Email::Address - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

# VERSION

version 1.913

# SYNOPSIS

```
use Email::Address;

my @addresses = Email::Address->parse($line);
my $address   = Email::Address->new(Casey => 'casey@localhost');

print $address->format;
```
# DESCRIPTION

This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email addresses in strings and returns a list of `Email::Address` objects found. Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of this software is to be correct, and very very fast.

Version 1.909 and earlier of this module had vulnerabilies ([CVE-2015-7686](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686)) and ([CVE-2015-12558](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12558)) which allowed specially constructed email to cause a denial of service. The reported vulnerabilities and some other pathalogical cases (meaning they really shouldn't occur in normal email) have been addressed in version 1.910 and newer. If you're running version 1.909 or older, you should update!

Alternatively, you could switch to [**Email::Address::XS**](/pod/Email%3A%3AAddress%3A%3AXS) which has a backward compatible API. **Why not just use that?**

## Package Variables

**ACHTUNG!** Email isn't easy (if even possible) to parse with a regex, *at least* if you're on a `perl` prior to 5.10.0. Providing regular expressions for use by other programs isn't a great idea, because it makes it hard to improve the parser without breaking the "it's a regex" feature. Using these regular expressions is not encouraged, and methods like `Email::Address->is_addr_spec` should be provided in the future.

Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others. For convenience, these variables are declared as package variables that you may access from your program.

These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in RFC 2822.

You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want short names, define them yourself.

```
my $addr_spec = $Email::Address::addr_spec;
```
$Email::Address::addr\_spec

This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to look like.

$Email::Address::angle\_addr

This regular expression defines an `$addr_spec` wrapped in angle brackets.

$Email::Address::name\_addr

This regular expression defines what an email address can look like with an optional preceding display name, also known as the `phrase`.

$Email::Address::mailbox

This is the complete regular expression defining an RFC 2822 email address with an optional preceding display name and optional following comment.

## Class Methods

parse
```
my @addrs = Email::Address->parse(
  q[me@local, Casey <me@local>, "Casey" <me@local> (West)]
);
```

This method returns a list of `Email::Address` objects it finds in the input string. **Please note** that it returns a list, and expects that it may find multiple addresses. The behavior in scalar context is undefined.

The specification for an email address allows for infinitely nestable comments. That's nice in theory, but a little over done. By default this module allows for one (`1`) level of nested comments. If you think you need more, modify the `$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL` package variable to allow more.

```
$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I'm deep
```

The reason for this hardly-limiting limitation is simple: efficiency.

Long strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to parse, a bug which has not yet been adequately addressed. The default behavior is now to collapse multiple spaces into a single space, which avoids this problem. To prevent this behavior, set `$Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES` to zero. This variable will go away when the bug is resolved properly.

In accordance with RFC 822 and its descendants, this module demands that email addresses be ASCII only. Any non-ASCII content in the parsed addresses will cause the parser to return no results.

new
```
my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local');
my $address = Email::Address->new('Casey West', 'casey@local');
my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local', '(Casey)');
```

Constructs and returns a new `Email::Address` object. Takes four positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment, and original string.

The original string should only really be set using `parse`.

purge\_cache
```
Email::Address->purge_cache;
```

One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live in memory and there is the remote possibility that you will have a memory problem. On the off chance that you think you're one of those people, this class method will empty those caches.

I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory problem.

disable\_cache

enable\_cache
```
Email::Address->disable_cache if memory_low();
```

If you'd rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable (and re-enable) the Email::Address cache with these methods. The cache is enabled by default.

## Instance Methods

phrase
```
my $phrase = $address->phrase;
$address->phrase( "Me oh my" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the phrase portion of an address.

address
```
my $addr = $address->address;
$addr->address( "me@PROTECTED.com" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the address portion of an address.

comment
```
my $comment = $address->comment;
$address->comment( "(Work address)" );
```

Accessor and mutator for the comment portion of an address.

original
```
my $orig = $address->original;
```

Accessor for the original address found when parsing, or passed to `new`.

host
```
my $host = $address->host;
```

Accessor for the host portion of an address's address.

user
```
my $user = $address->user;
```

Accessor for the user portion of an address's address.

format
```
my $printable = $address->format;
```

Returns a properly formatted RFC 2822 address representing the object.

name
```
my $name = $address->name;
```

This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the address. First the `phrase` is checked. If that doesn't work out the `comment` is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the `user` portion of the `address` is returned.

This method does **not** try to massage any name it identifies and instead leaves that up to someone else. Who is it to decide if someone wants their name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

## Overloaded Operators

stringify
```
print "I have your email address, $address.";
```

Objects stringify to `format` by default. It's possible that you don't like that idea. Okay, then, you can change it by modifying `$Email:Address::STRINGIFY`. Please consider modifying this package variable using `local`. You might step on someone else's toes if you don't.

```
{
  local $Email::Address::STRINGIFY = 'host';
  print "I have your address, $address.";
  #   geeknest.com
}
print "I have your address, $address.";
#   "Casey West" <casey@geeknest.com>
```

Modifying this package variable is now deprecated. Subclassing is now the recommended approach.

## Did I Mention Fast?

On his 1.8GHz Apple MacBook, rjbs gets these results:

```
$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 5
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.59/s             --           -44%
Email::Address 4.59/s            77%             --

$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 25
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.58/s             --           -67%
Email::Address 7.84/s           204%             --

$ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 50
                 Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
Mail::Address  2.57/s             --           -70%
Email::Address 8.53/s           232%             --
```

...unfortunately, a known bug causes a loss of speed the string to parse has certain known characteristics, and disabling cache will also degrade performance.

# PERL VERSION

This library should run on perls released even a long time ago. It should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version will not be increased. The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Subject: CVE-2018-12558: DOS in perl module Email::Address

Hello!

Perl module Email::Address, also in the last version 1.909 is vulnerable
to Algorithm Complexity problem and can cause Denial of Service when
attacker prepares specially crafted input. Root of this problem is that
parsing of email addresses in Email::Address module is done by regular
expressions, which in perl can be exponential.

The trivial input is 30 form-fields characters. You can test it with
following oneliner:

$ perl -MEmail::Address -E 'Email::Address->parse("\f" x 30)'

Vulnerable are all applications which receive (untrusted) emails and
parse address headers (From/To/Cc/...) by Email::Address module. Such
application can be DOSed by sending email with 30 form-fields characters
in From or To header.

Note that this is not the only one problematic input, due to way how is
Email::Address implemented it should be possible to prepare more
non-trivial inputs.

This problem was already reported to Debian Security Team and they
suggested to ask MITRE for assigning CVE identifier. MITRE now assigned
CVE-2018-12558.
