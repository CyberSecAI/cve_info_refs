- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Privilege escalation due to improper file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The Intel Driver and Support Assistant and Intel Computing Improvement Program had insecure file permissions that allowed an authenticated user to gain escalated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can potentially execute code as an administrator, leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated local user.
