Clean install Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-30-20190415.n.2.iso 2. Update with latest u-t 3. `dnf group install Virtualization` 4. `dnf install libvirt libvirt-dbus` because those are installed on two unrelated Fedora 29->30 systems. 5. Create a new machine using the wizard, picking a local ISO for F30server, and a precreated raw file using fallocate, both are in /var/lib/libvirt/images/ are are selected in the wizard without problem. 6. Choose the checkbox to customize 7. Change from BIOS to UEFI firmware 8. Start the VM  Actual results:  Indefinite black screen, no error.   Expected results:  I should see Tianocore splash screen and then GRUB menu, or an error.

Only the clean install of Fedora 30 is failing to work.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c5)  Chris Murphy    2019-04-21 01:28:00 UTC  ``` Whenever I set memory to 2560, this happens. If I change it to 2048 or 3072 the problem doesn't happen. A value of 2560 works fine on a Fedora 29 Server.  Anyway, it's either a regression bug in qemu, I guess? Or if it's now the correct behavior, then it's a bug in virt-manager for letting me enter an invalid value.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c6)  Cole Robinson    2019-04-23 14:41:07 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report. Sounds strange indeed having a specific memory value tickling this. I'll try to reproduce   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c7)  Cole Robinson    2019-04-23 16:03:53 UTC  ``` I can reproduce. It seems to be the combo of machine=q35 and edk2/uefi and the memory value. I tested both edk2-20190308stable-1.fc30 and older edk2-20180815gitcb5f4f45ce-5.fc30  With memory=2560, q35 + edk2 fails (no tianocore splash screen). q35+seabios and pc+edk2 work. With memory=2048 I don't see any failure. Other non-round memory values seem to tickle it too but I didn't investigate thoroughly  I was testing with qemu-4.0.0-0.4.rc1.fc30.x86_64 which is newer, so 3.1 and 4.0 are affected. VM config was roughly similar to what Chris posted above.  Laszlo have you heard of an issue like this?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c8)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-04-24 08:53:36 UTC  ``` Yes, this is a known issue, and as much as I dislike it, it is unfixable. Please use memory sizes that work.  For details, please refer to [bug 1666941](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941 "CLOSED ERRATA - UEFI guest cannot boot into os when setting some special memory size") (up to and including [bug 1666941 comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c13 "CLOSED ERRATA - UEFI guest cannot boot into os when setting some special memory size")). The short version is that there are two problems with arbitrary memory sizes: (a) PCIEXBAR placement disagreement between QEMU and OVMF, (b) MTRR configuration.  Problem (a) is fixable (you can find the patches in [bug 1666941 comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c14 "CLOSED ERRATA - UEFI guest cannot boot into os when setting some special memory size")), but fixing just (a) is insufficient, to remove the symptom.  Problem (b) is unfixable (see [bug 1666941 comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c13 "CLOSED ERRATA - UEFI guest cannot boot into os when setting some special memory size")). If a small RAM size is needed, please pick one that works, e.g. from the following list: -  512 MB -  768 MB - 1024 MB - 1536 MB - 2048 MB - 3072 MB - 4096 MB  My apologies.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c9)  Cole Robinson    2019-04-24 21:18:05 UTC  ``` Thanks Laszlo, that's interesting. If this is CANTFIX at the edk2 level then IMO we need to do something at a higher level, the failure scenario here of 'black screen VM that doesn't work' is horrible and going to generate lots of bug reports I imagine. Maybe libvirt or qemu can catch this situation and error for starters. I'll start a thread internally, I'm sure someone can come up with some clever idea.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c10)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-05-03 16:04:32 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c20](show_bug.cgi?id=1666941#c20 "CLOSED ERRATA - UEFI guest cannot boot into os when setting some special memory size")   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c11)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-05-16 19:36:11 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  $ git log --oneline --reverse 3b7a897cd8e3..39b9a5ffe661 | cat -n      1  60e95bf5094f OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: assign PciSize on both i440fx/q35 branches explicitly      2  9a2e8d7c65ef OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: hoist PciBase assignment above the i440fx/q35 branching      3  75136b29541b OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: reorder the 32-bit PCI window vs. the PCIEXBAR on q35      4  39b9a5ffe661 OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: fix MTRR for low-RAM sizes that have many bits clear   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1701710#c12)  Laszlo Ersek    2019-05-16 20:16:08 UTC  ``` Cole, Gerd, Paolo, in place of picking the above patches, you might want to rebase edk2 to the upcoming edk2-stable201905 release.
