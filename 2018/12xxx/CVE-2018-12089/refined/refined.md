Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of a Service Fabric Cluster password in clear text within the deployment logs when specific conditions are met. This occurs when the `OctopusPrintVariables` setting is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintentional exposure of sensitive credentials (the Service Fabric Cluster password) in plain text.
*   **Insecure Logging:** The system logs variables, including sensitive ones, without proper sanitization or redaction when `OctopusPrintVariables` is set to true.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the deployment logs can obtain the Service Fabric Cluster password.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With the compromised password, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Service Fabric cluster and potentially compromise other connected services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Deployment Logs:** The attack vector requires access to the deployment logs generated by Octopus Deploy. This could be through compromised accounts with access to the Octopus Deploy system or through exfiltration of the logs.
*   **Specific Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered when a Service Fabric Cluster target is configured with Azure Active Directory security mode and the `OctopusPrintVariables` setting is enabled (set to True).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User:** A user with "Task View" permissions within Octopus Deploy is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs access to the deployment logs where the password is printed in clear text.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Octopus Deploy versions 2018.5.1 to 2018.5.7.
*   It was fixed in version 2018.6.0.
*   The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
*   The weakness is categorized under CWE-200, which is "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor."
