| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=85453#c0)  Sergej Schumilo    2018-04-18 14:35:37 UTC  ``` Dear all, according to the bintutils maintainers the following OOM-bug is in the C++ name demangler (instead of the binutils application cxxfilt), which is part of the libiberty library.   This is the original binutils bug report (<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23059>):  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear all, after reporting the following bugs to the Ubuntu security team ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/1763101](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/%2Bbug/1763101)), we were asked to report them directly to the binutils developers:   ----------------------------------------------------  Dear all, The following binutils cxxfilt OOM bug was found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the input and an ASAN report.  Steps to reproduce:  Build current verison of binutils:  ``` pull-lp-source binutils cd binutils-2.30 CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make ```  Run inputs under ASAN:  ``` ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=false:allow_addr2line=true ./cxxfilt -t < oom ```  We can verify this issue for cxxfilt binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils") on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz server machine with 32GB RAM.

# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# USN-4326-1: libiberty vulnerabilities

8 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in libiberty.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [libiberty](/security/cves?package=libiberty) - library of utility functions used by GNU programs

## Details

It was discovered that libiberty incorrectly handled parsing certain

binaries. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted binary, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause

libiberty to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [libiberty-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty)
  -
  [20170913-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20170913-1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libiberty-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty)
  -
  [20160215-1ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libiberty/20160215-1ubuntu0.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# OOM-Bug in cxxfilt (binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1)

Bug #1763101 reported by
[Sergej Schumilo](https://launchpad.net/~schumilo)
on 2018-04-11

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [binutils (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils "Latest release: 2.43.90.20250122-2ubuntu1, uploaded to main on 2025-01-23 02:48:10.079873+00:00 by Matthias Klose (doko), maintained by Matthias Klose (doko)") | Confirmed | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

Dear all,

The following binutils cxxfilt OOM bug was found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the input and an ASAN report.

Steps to reproduce:

Build current verison of binutils:

```

pull-lp-source binutils

cd binutils-2.30

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address

-fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make

```

Run inputs under ASAN:

```

ASAN\_OPTIONS=halt\_on\_error=false:allow\_addr2line=true ./cxxfilt -t < oom

```

We can verify this issue for cxxfilt binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils") on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz server machine with 32GB RAM.

I have attached the input and an ASAN report.  Steps to reproduce:  Build current verison of binutils:  ``` pull-lp-source binutils cd binutils-2.30 CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make ```  Run inputs under ASAN:  ``` ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=false:allow_addr2line=true ./cxxfilt -t < oom ```  We can verify this issue for cxxfilt binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils") on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz server machine with 32GB RAM.

The problem however is in the C++ name   demangler, which is part of the libiberty library.  This library is   maintained by the gcc project, not the binutils project.  (It is used   by the binutils, but now owned by them).  Therefore, please could you   refile this bug report on the gcc bugzilla system:  <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=gcc>    Thanks very much.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=23059#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-01-01 21:39:55 UTC  ``` <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=85453> resp. <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=84950> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=23059#c3)  Kamlesh Kumar    2019-10-11 08:55:42 UTC  ``` ChangeLog which fixes this.  2018-12-22  Jason Merrill  <jason@redhat.com>          Remove support for demangling GCC 2.x era mangling schemes.         * cplus-dem.c: Remove cplus_mangle_opname, cplus_demangle_opname,         internal_cplus_demangle, and all subroutines.         (libiberty_demanglers): Remove entries for ancient GNU (pre-3.0),         Lucid, ARM, HP, and EDG demangling styles.         (cplus_demangle): Remove 'work' variable.
