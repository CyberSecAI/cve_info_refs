Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12393, extracted from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Integer Overflow During Unicode Conversion:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow that can occur during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation in Mozilla products (Firefox and Thunderbird). This overflow happens because the code calculates the required buffer size by multiplying a `unicodeLength` value by `sizeof(char16_t)`, where  `unicodeLength` is a `size_t` and `sizeof(char16_t)` is 2. If `unicodeLength` is large enough, the multiplication can cause an integer overflow which could lead to allocating too small a buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Buffer Allocation:** The integer overflow leads to allocating a buffer that is too small for the intended data, which then enables an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Lack of Sufficient Overflow Checks:** While the code uses `CheckedInt` to validate the initial `unicodeLength`, it does not perform the same validation on the multiplication step, making the overflow possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:**  A successful exploitation results in an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crash can occur due to this vulnerability, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Web Pages:** An attacker could create a malicious website or embed malicious script code in web content designed to trigger the vulnerability when loaded by the browser.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** The issue occurs when loading JavaScript, meaning the exploit is triggered when the malicious script is processed by the browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by tricking a user into opening a malicious website or by delivering a malicious script through another vector.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication.
*   **Target must be using 32-bit build:** Vulnerability is present only in 32-bit builds. 64-bit builds are not vulnerable.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `ScriptLoader::ConvertToUTF16` function.
*   The vulnerable code performs the following steps:
    1.  Calculate `unicodeLength` using `unicodeDecoder->MaxUTF16BufferLength(aLength)`.
    2.  Allocate memory using `js_malloc(unicodeLength.value() * sizeof(char16_t))`.
    3.  If the multiplication results in integer overflow, `js_malloc()` allocates an undersized buffer and later write will lead to memory corruption.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade to Fixed Versions:** Users are advised to update their affected Mozilla software to the fixed versions (Firefox 63, Firefox ESR 60.3, Thunderbird 60.3) which address this integer overflow vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score for the security impact.
*   The vulnerability is present in both Firefox and Thunderbird products.
*   Red Hat assigns a "Critical" severity level to the update.
*   The fixes involve a change that adds an integer overflow check during buffer allocation to prevent the undersized buffer allocation.
*  The issue was reported by "R at Zero Day LLC".
