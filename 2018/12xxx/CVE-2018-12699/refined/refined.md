Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-12699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `finish_stab` function in the `stabs.c` file of the GNU Binutils library. Specifically, a memory corruption issue exists when processing specially crafted input files.
*   The root cause is within the C++ name demangler, which is part of the `libiberty` library used by binutils.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption within the `finish_stab` function when processing stabs debugging information.
*   **Specifically a heap buffer overflow.** The crash occurs when writing to the heap.
*   **Multiple Vulnerabilities:** The provided documents indicate this is one of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities within binutils.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is the possibility of causing a denial-of-service condition by crashing the application. The program crashes with ASAN output pointing to a heap buffer overflow.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu Security Notice also mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution, though it's not specified how this would occur or if it is directly related to CVE-2018-12699. The report is not specific to this vulnerability, but rather to a large number of issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Files:** The attack vector involves enticing a user or an automated system to process a specially crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file.
*   **Objdump Tool:** The `objdump` utility, which is part of the binutils package, is the primary target of the attack. The tool processes the crafted files and triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a binary file with the crafted stabs debugging information to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to process the crafted file using vulnerable versions of binutils tools.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the user only needs to process the file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was initially reported against the `binutils` project but was later identified to be located in the C++ name demangler within `libiberty`, which is maintained by the GCC project.
*   The vulnerability was found through fuzzing with a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer.
*   The bug report includes crashing inputs and ASAN reports.
*   Patches were made in libiberty to resolve the issue.
*   The fix was made with commit `266886`.
