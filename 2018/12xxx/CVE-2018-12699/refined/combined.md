# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201908-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Binutils, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.32-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.32-r1** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially
crafted ELF, object, PE, or binary file, could possibly cause a Denial of
Service condition or have other unspecified impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.32-r1"

```

# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=85454#c0)  Sergej Schumilo    2018-04-18 15:11:09 UTC  ``` Dear all, according to the bintutils maintainers the following memory corruption bugs are in the C++ name demangler (instead of the binutils application objdump), which is part of the libiberty library.   This is the original binutils bug report (<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23057>):  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Dear all, after reporting the following bugs to the Ubuntu security team ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/1763102](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/%2Bbug/1763102)), we were asked to report them directly to the binutils developers:   ----------------------------------------------------  Dear all, The following binutils objdump memory corruptions were found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the crashing inputs and each ASAN report.  Steps to reproduce:  Build current verison of binutils: ``` pull-lp-source binutils cd binutils-2.30 CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make ```  Run inputs under ASAN:  ``` ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=false:allow_addr2line=true ./objdump --dwarf-check -C -g -f -dwarf -x $file ```  We can verify those issues for objdump binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils").

### Bug Description

Dear all,

The following binutils objdump memory corruptions were found by a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer (<https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/kAFL>). I have attached the crashing inputs and each ASAN report.

Steps to reproduce:

Build current verison of binutils:

```

pull-lp-source binutils

cd binutils-2.30

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure

CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address

-fsanitize-recover=address -ggdb" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" make

```

Run inputs under ASAN:

```

ASAN\_OPTIONS=halt\_on\_error=false:allow\_addr2line=true ./objdump --dwarf-check -C -g -f -dwarf -x $file

```

We can verify those issues for objdump binuitils-2.30-15ubuntu1 (Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS / sources from "pull-lp-source bintuils").

The problem however is in the C++ name   demangler, which is part of the libiberty library.  This library is   maintained by the gcc project, not the binutils project.
