Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability present in the `/system/WCore/WHelper.php` file of the wityCMS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted inclusion of local files, allowing an attacker to control the file path being included or accessed by the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include local PHP files, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable PHP file is included.
- An attacker can read non-PHP files, which may contain sensitive information like configuration files or database credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable file `/system/WCore/WHelper.php` where user-provided input is not sanitized and is used to include or access files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that controls the file path being included or accessed by the vulnerable script. This could be through a GET or POST request parameter, depending on how the application is designed and how user input is passed to this vulnerable function.
