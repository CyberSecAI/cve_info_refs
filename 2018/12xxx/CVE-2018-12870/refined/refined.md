Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12870:

**Summary:**

*   CVE-2018-12870 is an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to **information disclosure**.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read error in the software.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information from the process's memory by reading data outside of the intended buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a maliciously crafted file. The specific file format or structure is not mentioned, but it is related to the `JP2KLib.dll`, the library for JPEG2000 image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that, when parsed by vulnerable versions of Adobe Acrobat or Reader, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   The user must open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Check Point Research document provides extensive details on how they discovered a large number of vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-12870, through fuzzing the JP2KLib.dll library, which is used for processing JPEG2000 images within Adobe Acrobat and Reader.
*   They created a harness that isolates the JPEG2000 parsing functionality, allowing their fuzzer to efficiently generate a huge number of test inputs.
*   The document also provides a detailed explanation of the harness creation process which involves reverse engineering the target library.
