Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-12034:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the implementation of the virtual machine within the `yr_execute_code` function of the YARA library. Specifically, the `OP_PUSH_M` opcode does not perform bounds checking before accessing the scratch memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `OP_PUSH_M` opcode reads a memory location from the scratch memory using an index provided in the bytecode, without verifying if the index is within the bounds of the scratch memory. This results in an out-of-bounds read, potentially leaking sensitive information from the stack.
- The scratch memory `mem` is placed on the real stack, making it possible to read stack content

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious YARA rule in binary format that exploits the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running YARA.
- **Information Leakage:** Due to the ability to read out of bounds, stack content can be leaked and used to craft more complex exploits

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted binary rule:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted YARA rule in binary (pre-compiled) format.
- **Lack of input validation:** The vulnerability can be exploited if a service or third-party application runs a user-supplied YARA rule without proper validation, specifically if the application does not check if the rule is in binary format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a malicious rule:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted YARA rule to the vulnerable application or service.
- **Knowledge of YARA bytecode:** The attacker needs knowledge of the YARA bytecode to construct an exploit.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The `OP_PUSH_M` opcode reads a 64-bit immediate value from the bytecode as the index, and uses it to read from the `mem` array (scratch memory) without validation.

```c
case OP_PUSH_M:
    r1.i = yr_unaligned_u64(ip);
    ip += sizeof(uint64_t);
    r1 = mem[r1.i];           // Out-of-bounds Read
    push(r1);
    break;
```

- The scratch memory `mem` is defined as an array of `YR_VALUE` with a fixed size `MEM_SIZE` (defined as `YR_MAX_LOOP_NESTING*(YR_MAX_LOOP_VARS + YR_INTERNAL_LOOP_VARS)`).
- The YARA library does not distinguish between source and binary rule formats by default, blindly accepting both.
- The vulnerability exists in YARA versions 3.7.1 and earlier.
- The exploit can be used to achieve code execution, demonstrated by the ability to run calc.exe through ROP chain injection.

**Mitigations:**

- Checking every access to scratch memory
- Require an explicit flag to load and run a compiled rule
- Check that every relocated pointer does not point outside the buffer
- Make the loaded file read-only

The content also mentions another related CVE, CVE-2018-12035, which is caused by a similar issue in the `OP_POP_M` opcode, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Both issues were patched in later versions of YARA.
