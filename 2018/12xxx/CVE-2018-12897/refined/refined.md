{
  "CVE-2018-12897": {
    "Root cause": "Insecure handling of user input in the 'Host' field under SOCKS Proxy Settings within the Dameware Mini Remote Control (MRC) GUI.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper input sanitization",
       "Buffer overflow vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows an attacker to overwrite Structured Exception Handler (SEH) addresses, potentially hijacking the execution flow to run arbitrary code. Specifically, a successful exploit can lead to execution of arbitrary code, as demonstrated by the spawning of a `calc.exe` process.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation by providing a crafted input string into the vulnerable 'Host' field.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system running Dameware MRC and the ability to input data into the GUI. No specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting that the vulnerability could be exploited by a regular user with access to the application."
