# CVE-2018-12897: Solarwinds Dameware Mini Remote Control Local SEH Buffer Overflow

Adam Jeffreys

05 Sep 2018

Dameware Mini Remote Control (MRC) is a remote administration utility allowing remote access to end user devices for a variety of purposes. You can often find it among the plethora of toolkits used by system administrators managing the IT infrastructure in organisations.
Having recently completed my OSCE and looking to use some of the skills I picked up there in the real world, I found a local buffer overflow vulnerability in the latest version (at the time of writing) for Dameware MRC (12.0.5) and it has been assigned CVE-2018-12897. This vulnerability is due to insecure handling of a user input buffer which ultimately allows for overwriting Structured Exception Handler (SEH) addresses and the subsequent hijacking of execution flow.
Below is a video demonstration of exploitation for proof of concept of this vulnerability.

Solarwinds have been contacted about this issue who have acknowledged it and have released a version which reportedly contains the fix for the vulnerability, version 12.1. However, at the time of writing, this version doesn’t appear to be available from the customer portal and if you are affected by this issue, it is recommended that you request it directly from customer support.

## Method of Exploitation

One of the windows (AMT Settings) within in the GUI has several input fields. The majority of these fields lack appropriate input sanitization, leading to crashes when entering a large amount of input (more than 3,000 characters). However, for the proof of concept, only one of these fields was used; the “Host” field under the SOCKS Proxy Settings.

print("\nCopy and paste the above into the host field of the SOCKS proxy settings under the AMT Settings tab, then press the OK button. The payload above should result in a calc.exe process spawning. It can take a couple of attempts to work on a fresh install.")
```

I won’t go into too much detail about how it all works here but if you are interested, you should be able to get an evaluation copy of the software easily enough to have a go yourself! I’m sure there are many other ways to approach this (probably more elegant ways too!).
Finally, we can copy and paste in the constructed payload both inside and outside of the debugger to see what happens.

Several different mitigations for buffer overflows exist which can be implemented during compilation. In some situations, they can be bypassed but they still offer an added layer of protection to help prevent or increase the complexity required for exploitation of buffer overflows. These are not new and have been around for a good while now, its 2018 and yet still many applications are being compiled without these protections.

## 32 bit vs 64 bit

Due to the differences in the way that exceptions are handled between 32-bit and 64-bit applications, only the 32-bit version appears to be exploitable to run arbitrary code. The 64-bit version can be overflowed which will lead to a crash but there wouldn’t be any benefit in doing this from an attacking perspective.
Windows has some inbuilt protections which, when enabled, can help protect the end user from SEH based buffer overflow attacks. One of these, known as SEHOP (Structured Exception Handler Overflow Protection), enforces an integrity check of the SEH chain before permitting execution. It does this by creating a symbolic record at the end of the records and, at the point when an exception is raised, it checks to make sure that this is still present, thereby determining the integrity of the chain. If the integrity has been impaired, it will safely terminate the process. SEHOP can be enabled via Group Policy settings.
An older protection mechanism known as SAFESEH, can be set via a compilation flag. This works by comparing a table of known safe exception handler addresses with those in the chain before jumping to them. However, this technique has some downsides, one being including the requirement to recompile binaries with this flag to benefit from its protection.

## A personal note

Having recently passed my OSCE exam (which was an amazing experience and I fully recommend), I was looking to find something I could use my new found skill set to practise on. Finding this (while not the most exciting) was certainly rewarding and taught me some additional techniques that I may not have otherwise come across. However, the teaching was done by security professionals who have written some insanely useful and easy to follow tutorials. I want to extend a big personal thank you to all who spend their time writing these tutorials and guides. Two of the guides I used for Venetian Shellcode can be found below but the entire set of guides are invaluable for exploit development.
