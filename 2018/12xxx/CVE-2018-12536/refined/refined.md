{
  "CVE-2018-12536": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Jetty handles intentionally bad queries that do not match dynamic URL patterns. These queries are passed to the DefaultServlet, which, during static file serving, can trigger a java.nio.file.InvalidPathException.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure: The InvalidPathException includes the full path to the base resource directory used by the DefaultServlet or web application."
    ],
    "Impact": "The full server path to the web application's base resource directory is revealed to the requesting system in the error response.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends an intentionally crafted, malformed query that does not match a dynamic URL pattern. This query is then processed by the DefaultServlet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No special privileges or authentication is required."
  }
