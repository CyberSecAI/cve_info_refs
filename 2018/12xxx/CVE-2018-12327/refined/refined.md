  "CVE-2018-12327": {
    "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in ntpq and ntpdc of NTP version 4.2.8p11 allows a local attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6 command-line parameter.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `openhost` function in `ntpq/ntpq.c` and `ntpdc/ntpdc.c` copies a hostname provided via command-line argument into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Lack of bounds checking"
      ],
       "impact_of_exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service or code execution under privileges of the affected application, which might result in privilege escalation if the attacker manages to take control of execution flow.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker passing an overly long string as an argument to the `-4` (IPv4) or `-6` (IPv6) command-line parameter of `ntpq` or `ntpdc`."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local access to execute `ntpq` or `ntpdc` with crafted arguments."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support",
       "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7",
       "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support",
        "Ubuntu 12.04",
       "Ubuntu 14.04 ESM",
       "Ubuntu 16.04 ESM",
      "Gentoo (all architectures, versions < 4.2.8_p13)"
    ],
     "additional_notes": "The exploit is triggered by providing an oversized string as a hostname argument to ntpq or ntpdc. Red Hat's builds had stack smashing protection, which makes arbitrary code execution more difficult, but still allows for denial-of-service. This vulnerability is present in NTP version 4.2.8p11 and earlier. Patches are available from multiple distributions, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, which fix this issue by preventing the buffer overflow in the openhost() function."
