Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Mosquitto parses its password file used for authentication. Malformed data, specifically blank lines or lines starting with a comment character (`#`) that are intended to be ignored, are incorrectly interpreted as valid usernames with no password requirement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The parsing logic for the password file doesn't properly handle blank lines or commented-out lines, leading to them being interpreted as valid user entries.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Malformed entries allow clients to bypass authentication by using the malformed data as a username, which does not require a password to log in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and connect to the MQTT broker without valid credentials.
*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Once connected, the attacker can publish/subscribe to topics, potentially reading sensitive data or controlling connected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability from any location with network access to the MQTT broker.
*   **Malformed Password File:** The attack is triggered by the presence of malformed (blank or comment-prefixed) lines in the `mosquitto.users` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Mosquitto server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the server is vulnerable and that a blank or comment-prefixed line in the password file will allow a bypass of authentication by using the malformed line as a username.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not limited to blank lines; any line that is not a valid user definition becomes a valid username, including lines that are intended as comments within the file.
*   The vulnerability was verified against versions 1.4.8 (Ubuntu 16.04) and 1.5.5 of Mosquitto.
*   The mosquitto_passwd utility can be used to create and manage valid password entries, but the vulnerability is triggered when password files are maintained manually or by copy-pasting, which can easily introduce malformed lines.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.0 to 1.5.5 inclusive.
