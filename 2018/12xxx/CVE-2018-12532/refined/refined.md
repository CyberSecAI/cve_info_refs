Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2018-12532** is related to arbitrary EL (Expression Language) evaluation in RichFaces. Specifically, it's a bypass of the mitigation for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2015-0279) in RichFaces versions 4.5.3 to 4.5.17.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted EL Evaluation:** The core issue is that the `contentProducer` field, meant to be a MethodExpression object, can be manipulated to execute arbitrary EL expressions.
*   **Bypass of Previous Mitigation:** The patch for CVE-2015-0279 introduced a check for parentheses in EL expressions, but this was bypassed by using a `VariableMapper`. The attacker injects a variable into the `contentProducer` method expression (e.g., `${dummy.toString}`) and provides a custom `VariableMapper` that maps the variable to a `ValueExpression` controlled by the attacker. This allows execution of arbitrary code by resolving the variable through the attacker-controlled mapper.
*   **Deserialization of Malicious Data:** The vulnerability is triggered through the deserialization of the request data that includes the manipulated EL expression and the malicious `VariableMapper`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to full control of the affected system, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Request Parameter (`do`):** The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted data in the request parameter `do`, which contains a serialized object with the malicious EL expression and `VariableMapper`.
*   **Dynamic Resource Builder (`MediaOutputResource`):** The `MediaOutputResource` is used to dynamically generate resources, and the vulnerability exists in how it handles user-provided data during state restoration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable RichFaces application.
*   **Understanding of RichFaces Vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to know the specific way to bypass the mitigation and craft the malicious data for the `do` parameter.
*   **Ability to Craft Serialized Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to create serialized Java objects that include malicious EL expressions, and custom `VariableMapper` implementations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a much more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the typical CVE description.
*   It clarifies the vulnerability is a bypass of the CVE-2015-0279 patch using custom variable mappers, which were added to a whitelist starting from version 4.5.3 of RichFaces.
*   The vulnerability is present in RichFaces versions 4.5.3 to 4.5.17.
*   The blog post also provides mitigation advice, suggesting to block requests to URLs with paths containing `org.richfaces.resource.MediaOutputResource`.
