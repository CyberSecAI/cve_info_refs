- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "site name" parameter within the `admin_config.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website, which will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the site. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator to access the `admin_config.php` page. The attacker then injects malicious JavaScript code into the "site name" field. When users visit the site, the injected JavaScript is executed in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the vulnerable configuration page.
