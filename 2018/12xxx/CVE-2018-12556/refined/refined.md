CVE-2018-12556:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The document indicates that the attacks are against various implementations of OpenPGP and S/MIME email signature verification, exploiting flaws in the handling of emails with contradicting or unusual data structures (CMS attacks), in-band signaling in the GnuPG API (GPG API attacks), MIME wrapping attacks that abuse the email clients' handling of partially signed messages (MIME attacks), weaknesses in the binding of signed messages to the sender identity (ID attacks), and UI redressing attacks (UI attacks).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Flaws in the handling of emails with contradicting or unusual data structures, vulnerabilities in the GnuPG API's command line interface, MIME wrapping issues, weaknesses in the binding of signed messages to the sender identity, and UI redressing attacks.
- Impact of exploitation: Spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary messages in email clients.
- Attack vectors: Crafted emails containing manipulated S/MIME container format, GnuPG API injection attacks, non-standard MIME structures, misleading sender identity, and mimicking security indicators in UI.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to craft emails with manipulated content to exploit vulnerabilities in email clients.
