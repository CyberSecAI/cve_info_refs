### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Hannes Trunde (CVE-2018-12200) for reporting this issue and working with us on coordinated disclosure. CVE-2018-12208 was found externally by an Intel partner.

The remaining issues were found internally by Intel employees.  Intel would like to thank Yaakov Cohen, Arie Haenel, Tikvah Katz, Moshe Wagner, David-Hai Gootvilig, Yossef Kuszer and Dor Levy.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are deployed.
