The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-12610.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Open-Xchange AppSuite handles requests to access share information. Specifically, when accessing shared resources, the system exposes the share owner's email address through the API, even when it's not necessary for sharing functionality. Additionally, active sessions for shared resources are not terminated when the share owner modifies the share's password or lifetime, which allows access to the shared data even when the security parameters have been changed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Information Exposure (CWE-200): The system unnecessarily exposes the email addresses of share owners.
*   Session management vulnerability: Shared resource sessions persist despite changes to share access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Exposure of email addresses of share owners to unauthorized parties.
*   Attackers could use exposed email addresses to conduct targeted attacks like spam and malware distribution.
*   Access to shared data even when access should be revoked

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker needs access to a (public) sharing link created in Open-Xchange.
*   The attacker then makes an API request to retrieve the share owner's email address.
*   An attacker with an active session could access shared resources even after access to them should have been revoked.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to a valid share link to make the API request.
*   For persistent session access, the attacker needs an already active session to the shared resources.
