The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-12306.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input sanitization in the `file1` URL parameter in requests to `/portal/apis/fileExplorer/download.cgi`. This allows an attacker to inject path traversal characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability
- Improper input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the web interface can download arbitrary system files, including sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`. Since the web application process runs with root privileges, there are no restrictions on the files accessible through this vector.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/portal/apis/fileExplorer/download.cgi` with path traversal characters in the `file1` URL parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the web interface of the ASUSTOR AS-602T NAS device.
