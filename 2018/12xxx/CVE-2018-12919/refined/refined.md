- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `notice.php` page directly echoes the value of the `e` parameter from the GET request without any sanitization or encoding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a script in the `e` parameter and sends it to a victim. When the victim opens the link, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and send it to a victim, or trick the victim into clicking it.
