Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient access protection in the firmware. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to missing or inadequate checks on access control within the Intel server board firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access protection within the firmware, which allows unauthorized access and potential code execution.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Attackers can gain elevated privileges within the system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause the system to become unresponsive or unavailable.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The lack of access control can potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through local access to the affected server boards. This suggests the attacker needs to have some level of physical or direct access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs some level of local access to the affected server hardware.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The advisory lists several Intel Server Board, Server System, and Compute Module families that are affected, all with firmware versions prior to 00.01.0014.
*   **Mitigation:** The advisory recommends updating the firmware to version 00.01.0014 or later.
