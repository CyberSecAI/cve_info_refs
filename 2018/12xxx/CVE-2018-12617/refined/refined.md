{
  "CVE-2018-12617": {
    "Description": "The qmp_guest_file_read function (qga/commands-posix.c) is affected by an integer overflow and subsequent memory allocation failure. This weakness might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service (application crash).",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the memory size to allocate for reading a file in the guest agent.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to a heap overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) of the QEMU guest agent.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted QMP command 'guest-file-read' with a large 'count' argument to the QEMU guest agent through the listening socket."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send QMP commands to the QEMU Guest Agent, either by accessing the listening socket directly or through a compromised guest OS environment."
  }
