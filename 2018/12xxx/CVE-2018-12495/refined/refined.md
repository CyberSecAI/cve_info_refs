Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow within the `discount` Markdown processing library. Specifically, it occurs during the processing of specially crafted Markdown data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a heap buffer overflow, where the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region in the heap. This happens during operations such as `memmove`, while handling code blocks and trimming lines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. By providing specially crafted Markdown files, attackers can trigger the overflow, causing the program to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Potential for other impacts:** While not explicitly stated in the provided text, heap buffer overflows can sometimes lead to more serious vulnerabilities like arbitrary code execution if exploited more precisely. However, this is not detailed in these specific advisories, which focus on the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Markdown Data:** The attack vector involves providing malicious Markdown input to the `discount` library. This can be achieved through various ways, including processing user-provided content or via files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Markdown Input:** The attacker must be able to supply crafted Markdown data to the vulnerable application or system using `discount`. This could be by submitting a file to a service, posting content, or any other means of feeding input to the vulnerable code.
- **No Special Privileges:** The provided information doesn't indicate a requirement for special privileges or a specific position on the system other than the ability to provide input to `discount`.

**Additional Details:**
- The github issue #189 provides a stack trace with AddressSanitizer output clearly highlighting where the heap-buffer-overflow occurs during `memmove` calls. The provided testcase causing the crash is also mentioned.
- The Debian security advisories (DSA-4293-1 and DLA 1499-1) confirm the CVE ID and describe the fix for both stable and LTS versions of Debian. They also state that the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow, and mention that it can be triggered with specially crafted Markdown data.
- The DLA (Debian LTS) advisory mentions that the overflow leads to "heap-based buffer over-reads" resulting in a denial of service.
