{
  "CVE-2018-12364": {
    "Description": "NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of 307 redirects by NPAPI plugins, specifically Flash, leading to a bypass of CORS restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "CORS bypass",
      "NPAPI plugins trust issue"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious website can perform CSRF attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on a target web site by the victim.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious site uses a Flash plugin to perform a same-origin POST request that redirects with a 307 status code to a different domain.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a malicious webpage with an embedded Flash plugin that triggers a 307 redirect, along with knowledge of how to craft the attack.",
     "Additional Information": [
        "This vulnerability exists because NPAPI plugins, like Flash, can send cross-origin requests without a preflight check by using a same-origin POST that is redirected with a 307 status code.",
        "The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring Firefox performs a same-origin check before allowing the plugin to follow a 307 redirect.",
        "This vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 61, Firefox ESR 60.1, Firefox ESR 52.9 and Thunderbird 52.9 and later versions.",
         "Red Hat has addressed this vulnerability through RHSA-2018:2112 (RHEL 6) and RHSA-2018:2113 (RHEL 7) errata.",
         "This issue is also addressed in Debian Security Advisory DSA 4235-1 (firefox-esr) and DSA 4244-1 (thunderbird), and Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3705-1 and USN-3714-1."
