Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the Adobe Acrobat and Reader software, specifically within the processing of the JPEG2000 image format. The vulnerability lies in how the JP2KLib.dll library handles image data, and it can be triggered by crafted JP2 files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability involves reading data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to information disclosure or potentially lead to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive information from the memory of the affected application.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While this specific vulnerability is categorized as "Information Disclosure", it may be possible that through further exploitation or by chaining it with other vulnerabilities, an attacker might achieve arbitrary code execution. The advisory also mentions that successful exploitation of other related vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector involves a crafted PDF file containing a specially crafted JPEG2000 image that triggers the vulnerability when parsed by the Adobe Reader/Acrobat.
*   **Directly Fuzzed JP2 File:** The vulnerability can also be triggered directly through crafted JP2 files, as demonstrated during the research using the WinAFL fuzzer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF or a JP2 image file.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader, or the attacker must be able to supply the crafted JP2 file to the target, or in cases where the file is processed by the target.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using WinAFL, which involves providing malformed input data to a program in order to identify potential flaws.
* The research indicates that this vulnerability is part of a larger group of 53 critical bugs found in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro within a 50-day time frame using fuzzing.
