  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Thunderbird handles S/MIME encrypted content when replying or forwarding emails. Specifically, decrypted S/MIME parts included in HTML, can leak plaintext if hidden using CSS or <plaintext> tags and the user replies or forwards the email in HTML format.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of HTML content within encrypted email.",
        "Failure to sanitize or isolate decrypted S/MIME parts in replies/forwards."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leak the plaintext of encrypted emails by crafting malicious HTML emails, and then sending them to a recipient who replies or forwards the email. By hiding the decrypted parts using CSS or <plaintext> tags, the recipient may not be aware of the leaked plaintext, thereby leaking sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting malicious HTML emails with S/MIME encrypted content that is hidden through CSS or <plaintext> tags.",
        "Email recipient replies to or forwards the crafted email in HTML format."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails and has knowledge about the S/MIME encrypted messages of their target. Furthermore, they need to craft the HTML content to hide the decrypted information."
