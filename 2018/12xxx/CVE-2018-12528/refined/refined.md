### Relevant Content:
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Intex Router N-150 firmware allows arbitrary file uploads without proper extension checking.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files, leading to firmware compromise and router takeover.
**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the router's web interface by navigating to the backup/restore page and uploading a file.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the router's web interface and must be able to authenticate to access the advanced settings.

**Additional Details:**
- The uploaded file can have any extension.
- After the file is uploaded, the router firmware reboots, accepting the arbitrary file.
- The blog post provides steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The blog suggests implementing extension checking to allow only configuration files.

**Exploit-DB Content:**
- The Exploit-DB entry mentions a related CSRF vulnerability, but it also refers to the arbitrary file upload issue under the description section
- The provided exploit code shows a CSRF attack vector to create a privileged user, demonstrating that the router lacks CSRF protection.
