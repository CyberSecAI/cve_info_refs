Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-12909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the `webgrind` application, specifically within the `fileviewer` functionality. The application uses user-supplied input via the `file` parameter to display file contents, without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly uses the `file` parameter received from the user to access and display files from the server's local file system. This is a classic LFI vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the user-supplied `file` parameter. It does not check if the file path is within an allowed directory, if the path is valid or if the user has the permissions to access the specified file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can read any file that the web server process has permissions to access. This can include system configuration files, application source code, sensitive data, etc. In the example given, the attacker could read `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive files can lead to exposure of confidential information which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker provides a `file` parameter containing the path of the file to be read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Application Logic:** The attacker needs to understand how to use the `op=fileviewer` functionality and that a `file` parameter is used.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

* The content provides a specific example of how to exploit the vulnerability: `example.com/webgrind/index.php?op=fileviewer&file=/etc/passwd`.
* The Github issue #112 highlights this vulnerability and contains specific code snippet where the vulnerability resides.
