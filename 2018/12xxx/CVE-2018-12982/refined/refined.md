The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12982.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An invalid memory read occurs in the `PdfVariant::DelayedLoad()` function within `PdfVariant.h` of the PoDoFo library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory read in `PdfVariant::DelayedLoad()`.
- The vulnerability exists in PoDoFo versions 0.9.5 and 0.9.6-rc1.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault (SEGV). The application crashes when trying to read from an invalid memory location.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted PDF file is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing the crafted PDF using PoDoFo, specifically using the `podofocolor` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file that exploits the invalid memory read.
- They need to be able to submit this file for processing by a vulnerable PoDoFo library, e.g., through a tool like `podofocolor`.
