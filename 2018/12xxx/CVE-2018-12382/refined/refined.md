  "CVE-2018-12382": {
    "description": "The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Firefox for Android handles `javascript:` URIs. The browser attempts to highlight the base domain within the address bar, which can be manipulated using JavaScript to insert text before the domain name, causing the actual domain to be scrolled out of view.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Address bar spoofing",
        "Improper handling of javascript: URIs",
		"Insufficient sanitization of URL display"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor can craft a `javascript:` URI that, when opened in a new tab, spoofs the displayed address bar URL. This can deceive users into believing they are on a legitimate website, when they are actually on a malicious site. This can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other forms of user deception.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious web page",
		"Specially crafted javascript: URI"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious web page that can open a new tab with a crafted `javascript:` URI. This does not require any special privileges or advanced capabilities beyond hosting a simple webpage."
