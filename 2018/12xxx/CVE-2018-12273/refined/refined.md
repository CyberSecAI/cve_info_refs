{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Ciudad' and 'Nombre' parameters when rendering it in the context of an HTML page, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious websites, and more.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the 'Ciudad' and 'Nombre' parameters. The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL or embedding it in a malicious web page.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters and needs to be able to get a victim to click on the URL."
