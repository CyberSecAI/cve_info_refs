Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12051:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation and sanitization in the `webmasterst/general.php` script of the "Schools Alert Management Script." This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, by exploiting the file upload functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application fails to validate the type of uploaded file. Specifically, it allows uploading a PHP file disguised as an image (with the Content-Type set to `image/jpeg`)
- Lack of input sanitization: The filename or content is not checked, which enables the attacker to upload and execute malicious code
- Remote Code Execution: Successfully uploaded PHP files are then executable on the server

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts, an attacker can gain complete control over the server, allowing them to:
  - Modify or steal data
  - Install malware
  - Disrupt the application's availability
  - Pivot to other systems on the network
- Full control of the server where the application is installed

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to `/schoolalert/webmasterst/general.php`.
- `multipart/form-data`: The malicious payload (PHP code) is embedded within a `multipart/form-data` request, disguised as an image upload via the `sch_logo` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No Authentication Required: The exploit does not require any authentication. Any attacker can perform the exploit.

**Technical details:**
The attacker sends a POST request to `/schoolalert/webmasterst/general.php` with a multipart form. The form includes a file upload field named `sch_logo` where a malicious PHP file with the name `x1.php` is uploaded. The content type for this upload is set to `image/jpeg` to bypass initial checks. The uploaded file contains PHP code that can be executed by the server.

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the attack, showing that a malicious PHP file can be uploaded and executed, resulting in the output of phpinfo().
