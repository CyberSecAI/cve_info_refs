List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.2.1

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12377: Use-after-free in refresh driver timers](#CVE-2018-12377)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when refresh driver timers are refreshed in some circumstances during shutdown when the timer is deleted while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1470260](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1470260)

#### [#CVE-2018-12378: Use-after-free in IndexedDB](#CVE-2018-12378)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when an IndexedDB index is deleted while still in use by JavaScript code that is providing payload values to be stored. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1459383](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459383)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

* [Bug 1412081](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081)

#### [#CVE-2018-12385: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data](#CVE-2018-12385)

Reporter
Philipp
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A potentially exploitable crash in `TransportSecurityInfo` used for SSL can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

* [Bug 1490585](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1490585)

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

#### [#CVE-2018-12376: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62, Firefox ESR 60.2, and Thunderbird 60.2.1](#CVE-2018-12376)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1459383](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1459383)

#### [#CVE-2018-18499: Same-origin policy violation using meta refresh and performance.getEntries to steal cross-origin URLs](#CVE-2018-18499)

Reporter
James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation allowing the theft of cross-origin URL entries when using a `<meta> meta http-equiv="refresh"` on a page to cause a redirection to another site using `performance.getEntries()`. This is a same-origin policy violation and could allow for data theft.

##### References

* [Bug 1468523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1473113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1473113)

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

* [Bug 1412081](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412081)

#### [#CVE-2018-12381: Dragging and dropping Outlook email message results in page navigation](#CVE-2018-12381)

Reporter
Jana Squires
Impact
low
##### Description

Manually dragging and dropping an Outlook email message into the browser will trigger a page navigation when the message's mail columns are incorrectly interpreted as a URL.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems with Outlook installed. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12376: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2](#CVE-2018-12376)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, and Andrei Cristian Petcu reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Synopsis

Important: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3458)

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Alex Gaynor, Boris Zbarsky, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Tyson Smith, Bogdan Tara, Karl Tomlinson, Mats Palmgren, Nika Layzell, Ted Campbell, Nils, Zhanjia Song, Holger Fuhrmannek, Philipp, and Jurgen Gaeremyn as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

All running instances of Thunderbird must be restarted for the update to take effect.

#### [#CVE-2018-12379: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file](#CVE-2018-12379)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the Mozilla Updater opens a MAR format file which contains a very long item filename, an out-of-bounds write can be triggered, leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This requires running the Mozilla Updater manually on the local system with the malicious MAR file in order to occur.

#### [#CVE-2017-16541: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs](#CVE-2017-16541)

Reporter
Filippo Cavallarin
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Browser proxy settings can be bypassed by using the automount feature with autofs to create a mount point on the local file system. Content can be loaded from this mounted file system directly using a `file:` URI, bypassing configured proxy settings.
*Note: this issue only affects OS X in default configurations. On Linux systems, autofs must be installed for the vulnerability to occur and Windows is not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12382: Addressbar spoofing with javascript URI on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12382)

Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
low
##### Description

The displayed addressbar URL can be spoofed on Firefox for Android using a `javascript:` URI in concert with JavaScript to insert text before the loaded domain name, scrolling the loaded domain out of view to the right. This can lead to user confusion.
*This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12383: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2018-12383)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Looben Yang, Jesse Ruderman, Sebastian Hengst, Nicolas Grunbaum, and Gary Kwong reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 61.

## Topic

An update for thunderbird is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

This update upgrades Thunderbird to version 60.2.1.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2 (CVE-2018-12376)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in driver timers (CVE-2018-12377)
* Mozilla: Use-after-free in IndexedDB (CVE-2018-12378)
* Mozilla: Proxy bypass using automount and autofs (CVE-2017-16541)
* Mozilla: Out-of-bounds write with malicious MAR file (CVE-2018-12379)
* Mozilla: Crash in TransportSecurityInfo due to cached data (CVE-2018-12385)
* Mozilla: Setting a master password post-Firefox 58 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords (CVE-2018-12383)

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited in Thunderbird by a specially crafted HTML mail, as JavaScript is disabled for mail messages and cannot be enabled. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the remote content of an RSS feed.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:15:19 UTC  ``` If a user saved passwords before Firefox 58 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Firefox 58. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.    External Reference:  <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2018-20/#CVE-2018-12383>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-05 07:15:23 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mozilla project Upstream: Jurgen Gaeremyn   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c6)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-17 00:42:30 UTC  ``` More information including wontfix decision in the upstream ticket:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1475775>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-17 00:42:44 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate against this flaw, examine user profile directories for the presence of both `key3.db` and `key4.db` files.  If both are present, `key3.db` should be deleted.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-27 20:38:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:2834 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2834](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2834)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-27 20:44:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2835 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2835](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2835)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c14)  Doran Moppert    2018-10-09 01:59:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  Upstream decided to not fix this issue in Firefox ESR 60.2 given the low impact.  A future ESR update may correct this flaw.  This flaw would impact users who had saved passwords from Firefox 58 or earlier that were not protected by a master password (resulting in an un-encrypted `key3.db`), but set a master password when using Firefox 59 or newer (resulting in an encrypted `key4.db`).  The old key file was kept around to facilitate downgrading to Firefox 58.  This flaw cannot be exploited through email in Thunderbird as scripting is disabled in this for email content. It may be possible to exploit through Feeds (Atom or RSS) or other browser-like contexts.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 16:58:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:3403 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3403](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3403)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1625531#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 10:44:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3458 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3458](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3458)   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

[update.mar.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8989519)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8989519&action=edit)

By opening a mar file which contains a very long item file name (length = max int) it's possible to trigger an invalid memcpy call. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read/write.
To reproduce extract the update.mar and try an update with an 64bit updater or use the mar tool like 'mar -t ./update.mar'

Why aren't we validating (and in this case rejecting) the .mar signature before doing \_anything\_ else with a potentially evil fake update?
Haven't looked into it but let's start with "sec-high" and hope that's an over-estimate.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

This is definitely a real out of bounds write. I'm not sure if it would end up being exploitable in practice, but it's definitely at least a crash.
I can't see a reason why we need to parse the index before we check the signature. I'll work on changing that.Assignee: nobody → mhowellStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
In my opinion the patch does not point to a specific exploit.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I do not believe so.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All supported branches.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
N/A
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Backports should be trivial to create and would likely be identical to the patch here; the affected code has not been under active development on any supported branch.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely because the patch is straightforward and solid automated testing coverage exists. However as with any updater patch giving it a few days on Nightly before approving any uplifts would be a worthwhile precaution.

Patch
I think it's been long enough, I haven't seen any problems or reports of problems. As I suspected it would, this patch applies cleanly to beta and ESR 60.
[ESR Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
This is a sec-high bug.
User impact if declined:
Potential for privilege elevation via updater exploit.
Fix Landed on Version:
63
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Risk is low because the patch is straightforward and has both been through the updater automated testing and also been given a trial run on nightly for several days.
String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None
[Beta Approval Request Comment]
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
This bug has probably always been there; I didn't look past where the hg history starts, but it appears to have been there already by then.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
NoneFlags: needinfo?(mhowell)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.79 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
IMO, the fix for the following issue is incomplete: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1246956](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246956 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() after restore previous session")
We can still access to the Cross-Origin URL, which should be blocked.
This issue has been found in Microsoft Edge too.
Proof Of Concept:
redireg.html:
<embed src="/con.html">
<script>
setTimeout(function(){alert(performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1].name)},5000);
</script>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="6;url=<http://pwning.click/histback.html>">

</b>
con.html:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>">
histback.html:
<Script>
history.back();
</script>
Test live on Microsoft Edge / Mozilla Firefox: <http://pwning.click/redireg.html>
While Microsoft Edge also allows to steal saved frame's history navigation through performance.getEntries() and embed tag, Mozilla Firefox only allows to access to Cross-Origin URL, but still this should not happen.
As this report involves Microsoft Edge's Cross-Origin URL access Vulnerability, please do not open this report publicly eventhough this is not considered as a Vulnerability or after problem is resolved.
Actual results:
Mozilla Firefox allows us to access Cross-Origin URL
Expected results:
Accessing to Cross-Origin URL should be not possible.

The Original report for Microsoft Edge Information disclosure across origins:
Hi, there is Information disclosure issue in Microsoft Edge where failing to keep history information.
First, A framed navigation in the src attribute of the embed confuses this browser and a functionality problem ends up being a security bug.
We are using HTML <meta> http-equiv Attribute page that redirects to site and navigate inside an embed tag. There is a functionality bug in Microsoft Edge, which overrides the latest location when we use Iframe tag, so instead I used embed tag to grab latest history information inside embed, we can fool the browser and make it remember the typed information in the wrong place.
This works because Microsoft Edge confuses when we load a redirection page with <meta> http-equiv Attribute inside an embed tag, which allows us to access information across origins.
However, we need to use history.back() to make sure embed tag remember the typed information.
Proof Of Concept:
redireg.html:
<embed src="/con.html">
<script>
setTimeout(function(){alert(performance.getEntriesByType("resource")[1].name)},5000);
</script>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="6;url=<http://pwning.click/histback.html>">

bug\_1468523\_v0.patch
Have you gone through all the places where a new nsIDocShellLoadInfo is used?
nsDocShellLoadInfo::SetOriginalURI seems to be called only in some of those cases. Is that ok?

I have check them all and also I have checked InternlLoad and LoadURI calls as well. I thinks that all cases are covered but I have to say that I am not the expert on DocShell. Maybe it would be good that someone with more knowledge check them as well.

bug\_1468523\_v0.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch shows what the problem is (originURI was introduce to mitigate similar problems, so it is obvious what the problem is). Although it only affects sites with meta http-equiv="refresh".
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The patch does simple shows what the problem is.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches?
If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? The patch should apply to all branches, if not it is easy to rebase it and it is not risky.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? It is very unlikely that it will cause regressions.

"Embargo" is about what we publish, it may mean not listing this fix in the security advisories or being appropriately vague. The sec-approval process will take that into account for whether it affects when or if we land a fix but most of the time it doesn't delay us from landing a fix.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

good catch!
this is on a good way, but it's unfortunately not entirely correct..
during a 30X redirect handling in the old http channel we set the result principal URI (rpURI) on the new channel's load info ONLY when it's left null by the new channel's protocol handler (we may redir not only to http:), we don't set rpURI on http channels (these days..)
if we are redirected to something else than http: that sets rpURI (e.g. the moz: and sometimes the file:, chrome:, resource: and about: protocols) then it may break assumptions and mainly security checks.
one possible solution could be to use load types [1] as a condition to enforce rpURI replacement only when not already set on the channel's loadinfo, at [2].
other way would be (still a bit hacky!) to prevent refresh to anything else than http:, but that doesn't sound right to me.

I meant docshell type of load on loadinfo:
- nsIDocShellLoadInfo::loadNormalReplace
- nsIDocShellLoadInfo::loadRefresh
any reason why this is better/equiv?

I have one comment on this: I think we do not need to store ReplaceResultPrincipalURI into history. I tested it with a load form history and a session restore and it worked correctly. If you think I should add it, I will make a patch.

oh, this is nice.. the load types have just been modified in [bug 1472087](/show_bug.cgi?id=1472087 "RESOLVED FIXED - DeCOMtaminate nsIDocShellLoadInfo")! but it seems to work the same way as before.

instead of "replaceRPURI" it IMO should be "keepRPURI", because we want to prevent replacing it in this specific refresh case (loadNormalReplace or loadRefresh).
the name, as is, is confusing for me.
btw, isn't really the load type available in some docshell member? can't you take it from the loadInfo?
regarding the need for the arg/condition element, there are possible corner cases. When there already is rpURI on the load info, we MUST keep it during the replace/refresh case. In all other cases we force-replace it, always.
hence, just
if (aResultPrincipalURI && !rpURI)
is not correct/enough at all unless I miss something.

this is where we collect all information from a nsDocShellLoadInfo.

I took it from loadInfo in my previous patch :) (you preferred nsIDocShellLoadInfo types). loadInfo holds a translated version of nsIDocShellLoadInfo type.

Ah!!! Yes, my mistake, I'm really sorry for that! I think mLoadType was the way to go all the time, I somehow misplaced that for load flags :((
But OTOH you could freely oppose to [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") that this was actually equivalent ;)

I think the explanation, at least partial, is this: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1319111#c174](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319111#c174 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose result principal URL (\"final channel URL\") on LoadInfo, convert current consumers of LOAD_REPLACE")
To make sure I understand your original question here - you mean we don't need the `LOAD\_NORMAL\_REPLACE or LOAD\_REFRESH` condition added and only add `if (!rpURI)`? [Comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") is trying to explain why we definitely don't.
The refresh/replace case is actually a redirect. We somewhat `abuse` (may be too strong word, tho) the rpURI restore through the loadInfo structure. To do it right, we must treat it the same way as in case of a redirect, e.g. in nsHttpChannel, i.e. set to the target URI, IF NULL.
For a normal restore load we want to override to the stored rpURI, regardless if the uri's handler has set some of its own, same or even different. I can't find the comment or note why it's the case exactly, but I clearly remember talking about this with Boris once. I believe the reason is we want to make sure the document URI is the same, which also applies to iframes, xml docs, embeded docs. This uri is critical, since it's used for security checks.
Maybe we need to walk through this again and make sure we clearly understand why we do things the way we do but please not in this bug.
Does this make sense?

i.e. to set rpURI to be the target URI (the one we created the channel for), if rpURI is null. if rpURI is non-null, leave it.

So I left the keepResultPrincipalURIIfSet because nsIDocShellLoadInfo::loadNormalReplace can be set in other cases as well.

Clearest and best possible solution, thanks!
note that we don't need to persist this new docshellloadinfo property in session store because:
- when storing a page state we are storing the correct value for rpURI (that may have been set according the "keep-if-set" flag) and thus no longer need the flag
- the value "true" is never used for session restore, only for meta refresh which never comes from the session store code

Yes I came to the same conclusion about session history.

bug\_1468523\_v2.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
The patch shows what the problem is (originURI was introduce to mitigate similar problems, so it is obvious what the problem is). Although it only affects sites with meta http-equiv="refresh".
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The patch does simple shows what the problem is.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? yes
If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? it was easy to rebase the patch.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? I believe it is unlikely that it will cause regressions. The patch carefully adds the new code so that it does not cause regressions with some corner cases (I made sure that only this specific code path is affected by the change and other code-paths are unaffected).

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: long existing bug
[User impact if declined]: Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries()
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet, I did local testing since there are steps to reproduce.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: there are described in [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL")
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: I think not, but I cannot tell for sure.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: I believe it is unlikely that it will cause regressions. The patch carefully adds the new code so that it does not cause regressions with some corner cases (I made sure that only this specific code path is affected by the change and other code-paths are unaffected).

I managed to reproduce this issue on Firefox 62.0a1 (2018-06-12), under Windows 10x64, using the test page from [Comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL").
I noticed that on Firefox 62.0b12 '<http://pwning.click/con.html>' is displayed and on Firefox 63.0a1 (2018-07-29) '<http://pwning.click/favicon.ico>'. Is expected to have different results on Nightly and Beta builds?
Tests were performed under Windows 10x64, macOS 10.12.6 and under Ubuntu 18.04x64.

I think it is a timing issue (whether it is showing '<http://pwning.click/con.html>' or '<http://pwning.click/favicon.ico>'.
The important thing is that is not showing '<https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>'.

Does description in the security advisories need to be specific? as far as report stays private and information on the advisories being vague isn't that ok? Also, that variant uses different trick as I mentioned before.
e.g. description might include "Same Origin Policy Violation using Resource Timing API" but not include something like "redirection using a meta-refresh"
Note that original bug with this trick has been fixed anyways.

If you open <http://pwning.click/redirffeg.php> on Microsoft Edge, it alerts "<http://pwning.click/con.html>" which is expected behavior.
I don't understand why this should be not on Security Advisories.

I'm adding the Microsoft contact. They state that there are variant issues that won't be fixed until the November 13 update so they would prefer to keep public disclosure quiet until after they ship their final fixes.

It seems that <http://pwning.click/con.html> does a meta refresh to <https://www.bing.com/search?q=test>

The repro in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL") seems to be fixed though.Flags: needinfo?(dd.mozilla) → needinfo?(mihai.boldan)

Taking in consideration [Comment 63](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468523#c63 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing of URL cross-domain using performance.getEntries() once again, treat meta refresh channel as a redirect by setting result principal URL"), I'm marking this issue verified also on the ESR build.
