For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-02 22:36:17 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1597427,1597429  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c2)  Milan Crha    2018-09-04 07:09:47 UTC  ``` According to: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12983> this is tracked upstream as: <https://sourceforge.net/p/podofo/tickets/23/> which contains a proposed patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c3)  Fedora Update System    2018-12-20 01:00:40 UTC  ``` mingw-podofo-0.9.6-5.fc29 podofo-0.9.6-3.fc29 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-6b9320d9c9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c4)  Sandro Mani    2018-12-20 09:16:46 UTC  ``` Bug mistakenly marked as addressed by mingw-podofo-0.9.6-5.fc29 / podofo-0.9.6-3.fc29.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c5)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 20:06:29 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c6)  Fedora Update System    2020-07-02 09:25:52 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1597429#c7)  Fedora Update System    2020-07-03 01:22:53 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc has been pushed to the Fedora 31 testing repository.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-07-02 22:36:37 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1597427,1597432  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c2)  Milan Crha    2018-09-04 07:10:04 UTC  ``` According to: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12983> this is tracked upstream as: <https://sourceforge.net/p/podofo/tickets/23/> which contains a proposed patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c3)  Fedora Update System    2018-12-20 01:00:30 UTC  ``` mingw-podofo-0.9.6-5.fc29 podofo-0.9.6-3.fc29 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2018-6b9320d9c9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c4)  Sandro Mani    2018-12-20 09:15:31 UTC  ``` Bug mistakenly marked as addressed by mingw-podofo-0.9.6-5.fc29 / podofo-0.9.6-3.fc29.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c5)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 20:06:30 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c6)  Fedora Update System    2020-07-02 09:25:55 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-2d80e03190 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-2d80e03190>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c7)  Fedora Update System    2020-07-02 09:25:58 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1597432#c8)  Fedora Update System    2020-07-03 01:22:55 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-71e2092ebc has been pushed to the Fedora 31 testing repository.
