  "CVE-2018-12361": {
    "Description": "An integer overflow can occur in the `SwizzleData` code while calculating buffer sizes. The overflowed value is used for subsequent graphics computations when their inputs are not sanitized which results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in buffer size calculations within the `SwizzleData` code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to incorrect buffer size calculation",
      "Lack of proper sanitization of input values used for graphics computations",
	    "Usage of the overflowed value for subsequent operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crash due to out-of-bounds memory access or other memory corruption issues due to integer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By crafting specific image dimensions and processing parameters to cause an integer overflow"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to control or influence image processing parameters and dimensions to trigger the overflow.",
     "Affected component": "gfx::SwizzleCopy, gfx::SwizzleData, DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp",
	 "Patched versions": [
        "Firefox 61",
        "Firefox ESR 60.1",
		"Thunderbird 60",
		"Thunderbird 60.3.0-1~deb8u1",
