{
  "CVE-2018-12207": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "Improper invalidation for page table updates by a virtual guest operating system for multiple Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service of the host system via local access.",
      "Other_Details": "The vulnerability occurs due to improper invalidation of page table updates by a virtual guest OS, potentially leading to a denial of service on the host system. Specifically, the Intel CPU's Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU) doesn't correctly invalidate cached translations of virtual to physical memory addresses after a guest OS modifies its page tables. This could allow a malicious process within a guest VM to trigger a Machine Check Error (MCE) on the host, causing the CPU core to become non-functional."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Improper invalidation of page table updates by a virtual guest OS leading to a Machine Check Error (MCE)",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent state between the CPU's Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) and system software's Paging structure entries.",
        "Lack of proper invalidation of cached translations in the CPU's Instruction TLB (ITLB) after page table updates."
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service on the host system by halting the processor due to a Machine Check Error (MCE). Potential information disclosure via side-channel attack.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local access from an authenticated user within a virtual guest operating system."
       ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "An authenticated user within a guest VM needs the ability to modify page tables and trigger instruction fetches in a way that exploits the incorrect invalidation of cached address translations.",
        "Affected Components": [
            "Intel CPUs that utilize virtual memory and Translation Synchronization Extensions (TSX)"
        ]
    }
