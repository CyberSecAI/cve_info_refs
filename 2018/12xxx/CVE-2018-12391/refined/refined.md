Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handles HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) audio playback. The browser was not correctly enforcing cross-origin policies when retrieving audio data from HLS streams. Specifically, the issue was that the underlying Android service (exoplayer2) was following redirects without informing Gecko, and wasn't performing CORS checks on the redirected URL. This allowed audio data to be accessed across origins in violation of security policies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Access:** The primary weakness is the ability to access audio data from a different origin than the page that initiated the request, violating the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).
*  **Inadequate CORS handling:** The HLS implementation on Android did not properly enforce CORS checks, particularly on redirects, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially steal audio data from different origins.
*   **Potential for broader resource access:** The vulnerability could potentially be expanded to access other types of cross-origin resources such as text or images.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could create a malicious web page that uses HLS to request and extract audio data from a victim's website.
*  **Redirect abuse**: The attacker can use redirects in the HLS manifest to point to a different origin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Basic Web Development Skills:** The attacker would need to create a malicious web page with embedded HLS playback using the web audio API to extract the audio data.
*   **Target User with Firefox for Android:** The vulnerability specifically affects Firefox for Android and doesn't impact desktop versions.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access by setting the `nsIPrincipal` to `nullptr`
*  The fix was implemented in Firefox 63, Firefox ESR 60.3 and Thunderbird 60.3
* The vulnerability is considered high impact because it allows for cross-origin data access, although it's worth noting there were some unrelated bugs that made it less likely to be exploited in the wild.
