| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_13\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.75 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://test.shhnjk.com/hls/webvideo.html>
2. Wait for video to stop playing and observe the alert saying "super bad"
Actual results:
Cross-origin audio data leaks. Audio tag on the right side will play stolen sound.
Expected results:
HTTP Live Stream is supported in Firefox for Android. And the M3U8 file allows audio data to be fetched from other origin. But Firefox only checks the url and misses the following redirect in <https://test.shhnjk.com/hls/same.m3u8>
#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio",NAME="English stereo",LANGUAGE="en",AUTOSELECT=YES,URI="<https://test.shhnjk.com/location.php?url=https://vuln.shhnjk.com/audio.m3u8>"
Where audio file is redirected and provided from "<https://vuln.shhnjk.com/audio.m3u8>". We can abuse this missed check to steal the audio samples using Web Audio API and read the audio data across-origin.

:drno, :padenot, seems :jya is on PTO so pinging you about this - feel free to redirect to someone else who knows our Fennec AV stack better.
Jun: thanks for the report. I'm assuming, based on you filing this against Firefox for Android, that this doesn't affect desktop (presumably because we're using platform support for m3u8 on Android, but don't do that elsewhere )?Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)Flags: needinfo?(padenot)Flags: needinfo?(drno)

I don't think Firefox supports HLS (.m3u8 files) in Desktop. If that's supported in any other platform, then it might be affected.Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)

Nick, you've reviewed some of this before. It looks like the right people are gone.
I can't repro on Nightly, but I can repro on release. On Nightly, the page does not seem to work, and Nightly eventually crashes [0].
Firefox Desktop does not support m3u8 playback so we're good there.
We think that we're handling cross-origin issues at [1]. Looks like we're doing some principal checking there but it's not about the resource, it's the URL of the manifest, so the CORS check passes.
[2] is probably where the problem lies: you can configure to bail out when a cross-protocol redirect occurs, but nothing about principals.
The root of the problem is that we're letting something that is not Gecko perform an HTTP connection to a URL that can be controlled by content, and that's VERY BAD. This bit of Java does not know anything about CORS, and is upstream code (that we appear to have patched). One solution is to plumb down a principal CORS to DefaultHttpDataSource.java and teach it about CORS, but maybe there is something better we can do.
I'm pretty sure I can trivially turn this into an arbitrary cross-origin resource access (text/image/whatever) with a variant of [3].
cc-ing network people because this is a bit bigger in scope that I would have anticipated.

Yowza. I have no idea about any of the details of exoplayer2 -- I really was involved only to get the build system plumbing arranged. I'm not really surprised that Fennec's integration of that component caused issues in this manner:a mismatch of expectations between the browser and the consumed library. Score another one for really owning our network stack, even in our component libraries. My understanding is that this is \_not\_ an issue with exoplayer2, i.e., that this is an issue only because of the same-origin policy that the browser needs to enforce, which arbitrary exoplayer2 consumers don't care about.
I think the best thing I can do is expand the discussion to include snorp, who can a) vet my understanding of whether this needs to be upstreamed to exoplayer2, b) comment on whether this is relevant to GeckoView and/or future Android browsers, and c) redirect further to actually fix the underlying issue, or make the decision to disable exoplayer2/HLS in Firefox for Android.Flags: needinfo?(nalexander) â†’ needinfo?(snorp)

If we can't change exoplayer2 do we know enough in the Gecko layers to simply taint all HLS video, even same-origin ones? If most sites that use it are just playing the content (and it's not supported on Desktop anyway) maybe that's good enough?
Do we use exoplayer2 for other things? If so then the lack of CORS support is going to bite lots of other places.Keywords: [csectype-sop](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-sop&resolution=---),

exoplayer2 follows redirects I have seen that. Gecko does not know about these redirects. If gecko would know that a cross-origin redirect is made it could make proper decisions and avoid this problem. My question was is there a way the exoplayer2 tells gecko that it follow a redirect?

Yes, attaching a patch that does that if that's what we want. The patch is very simple.

It's only used to playback streams in HTMLMediaElement on Android (no other parts of Gecko make use of it). However it's plausible that some content is trying to do something more complex with those HTMLMediaElement (captureStream, Web Audio, canvas, etc.).
We could teach exoplayer2 about CORS, it does not seem too complicated from a quick look. We could also find a way to find the URL from which the media is currently being fetched from (after all redirects, etc.) and use Gecko facilities to determine the CORS status. I haven't seen an API call to do so (but haven't looked very hard), but it does not seem too crazy to add.
We could also wrap Gecko channnnels in a Java interface and inject it into exoplayer2. It's a bit weird to have something making http(s) requests randomly in Java code, in the middle of the media decoder of a browser engine.

Not in the current state of the code it looks like unfortunately.

Dragana's suggestion here sounds like the best path forward to me, if technically feasible: Hooking up exoplayer2 redirects with Gecko internal redirects (e.g. by then calling nsContentSecuriyManager::AsyncOnChannelRedirect()) would automagically perform the right security checks.
Is it possible to get callbacks into Gecko whenever exoplayer2 follows a redirect?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Not using current APIs offered by exoplayer2 for now. It's doable though.

I think this path is the best technically and produces the best outcome, but the cost is high and Fennec is in deep maintenance mode. I would follow this approach only if the exoplayer2 stack will be used for GeckoView. I do see that the thirdparty source is in geckoview/src/thirdparty/exoplayer2, so that seems positive. Even if we do try to "do the right thing", I think we should reconsider the correct path for HLS support in GeckoView. Is the best place to work...
- our own stack (expensive to build on Android, but the best outcome?)
- upstream exoplayer2 (a chance to update to newer exoplayer2 and solve this problem at the right level)
- our vendored exoplayer2 (little chance of breaking other things)
I'd like snorp to weigh in before we spend too much time trying to pursue the "correct" fix for exoplayer2.

IIRC, this wasn't feasible due to patent issues, but I also remember ajones telling me this gets better at some point. 2019?

I don't have a strong opinion on either of those options. Depending on the patent situation, we may not need to use exoplayer much longer. It's also not clear if HLS will remain relevant.Flags: needinfo?(snorp)

AFAIK, almost any streams on android is an HLS one... so it's still very relevant on mobile...

The change treats all HLS stream as cross-origin, even for same-origin resources.

I'm planning to present this bug on December too (though I'm not sure if I'll be selected). I can remove Firefox content if this won't be fix till December, but other browser has similar issue, so I expect other people can discover this bug too.

Yes. Treating all HLS streams as opaque is perfectly fine.Flags: needinfo?(tanvi)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

This needs comments.
Why it's done that way and the downside in doing so.

I understand the need to be discrete here on the vulnerability, but I'm concerned that the method as it is now will have its reasoning disappear into oblivion in a short amount of time.
So some explicit reference to this bug number at least is I believe necessary

For posterity's sake, I talked to padenot and asked him if this bug could move forward.
I didn't clearly explain that he needs separate(!) sec-approval on the patch, that I'm not entitled to grant.
I should have made clear during the conversation.
On a more uplifting note, padenot also tells me that there are other, unrelated bugs that actually stop the exploit from working.

[Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request]
Feature/Bug causing the regression: [Bug 1345752](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345752 "RESOLVED FIXED - [META][HLS] Make Gecko native support HLS on Fennec")
User impact if declined: Possible vector for CORS leak, however other bugs seem to prevent this being exploitable.
Is this code covered by automated tests?: No
Has the fix been verified in Nightly?: Yes
Needs manual test from QE?: No
If yes, steps to reproduce:
List of other uplifts needed: None
Risk to taking this patch: Medium
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): Some web-compat risk, we don't really know how many HLS streams are on other origin (probably quite a few), but the current code is completely incorrect and dangerous, so we're disabling it here.
String changes made/needed: NoneFlags: needinfo?(padenot)

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird ESR 60.3

Announced
October 31, 2018
Impact

Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.3

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
BjÃ¶rn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.
