The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in `liblnk` version 20180419. This response focuses on the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-12097.

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists within the `liblnk_location_information_read_data` function in `liblnk_location_information.c`.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when reading data related to location information from a crafted LNK file. This can lead to reading memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability results in information disclosure. Specifically, an attacker can cause a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially exposing sensitive data from the application's memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is a crafted LNK file.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted LNK file to the vulnerable software (e.g. by enticing a user to open it), or otherwise have the vulnerable `liblnk` library process it.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered by the following sequence of function calls:
1.  `liblnk_location_information_read_data`
2.  `liblnk_location_information_read`
3.  `liblnk_file_open_read`
4.  `liblnk_file_open_file_io_handle`
5.  `liblnk_file_open`
6.  `info_handle_open_input`
7.  `main`

The vulnerability manifests as a heap-buffer-overflow during a read operation within `liblnk_location_information_read_data` at memory address `0x60b00000020a`, attempting to read 2 bytes where it is not permitted. The provided crash log also indicates the location where the related memory was allocated.
