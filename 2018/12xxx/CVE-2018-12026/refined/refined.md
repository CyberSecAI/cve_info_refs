Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12026:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within SpawningKit, a subsystem in Passenger responsible for spawning application processes. A malicious app can exploit vulnerabilities introduced in the overhaul of SpawningKit in version 5.3.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Incorrect PID reporting by malicious app leading to process killing of arbitrary processes.
*   Race conditions that allow malicious users to induce reads and writes to arbitrary file paths by replacing path elements with symlinks.
*   Vulnerable permission checks allow a malicious user (Joe) to swap an app's socket directory with contents controlled by Joe, causing Passenger to forward the app's traffic to a process not belonging to the application (Jane).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Local Denial of Service (DoS) on the system by killing arbitrary processes.
*   Local privilege escalation by writing to files accessible by root.
*   Local information disclosure by reading arbitrary files.
*   Traffic redirection to arbitrary sockets controlled by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local exploitation by a malicious application running on the same system as Passenger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to run a malicious application on the same system where Passenger is running.
*   For the traffic redirection vulnerability, another user on the system should have write access to parent directories of the app socket directory.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content indicates that CVE-2018-12027 and CVE-2018-12028 are related to the same SpawningKit exploits as CVE-2018-12026.
* The vulnerabilities were introduced in Passenger versions 5.3.0 and 5.3.1.
* The vulnerabilities were mitigated in Passenger version 5.3.2.
* The fix includes extra permission checks, using symlink-resistant I/O operations, restricting sockets creation to the instance directory's app subdirectory, and verifying the ownership of the process returned by the preloader before killing it.
