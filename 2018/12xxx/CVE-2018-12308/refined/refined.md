The provided content is related to CVE-2018-12308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web interface of the NAS device includes the password used to encrypt shared folders in the URL of the initial request to create the folder and subsequent requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Exposure of sensitive information in URL parameters. Specifically, the encryption key for shared folders is sent in the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   An attacker who can intercept network traffic (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack) or obtain the URL through other means can obtain the encryption password of shared folders.

**Attack vectors:**
-   Network traffic interception
-   Access to browser history/logs where URLs may be stored
-   Any other method of obtaining the URL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to monitor network traffic, access browser history, or otherwise obtain the URL containing the encryption key.
-   No specific authentication or authorization is needed besides having a victim user perform the vulnerable operation.
