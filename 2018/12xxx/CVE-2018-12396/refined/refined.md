    "related": true,
    "summary": "WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts.",
    "details": "A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run. There are multiple Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) bugs in the scheduler of extension content scripts that allow an extension to run content scripts in principals that it should not have access to. TOCTOU bugs were found in `injectExtensionScripts` and `ExtensionPolicyService::CheckContentScripts` functions. This issue allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.",

    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, bypass access restriction, access otherwise protected information. A WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.",
