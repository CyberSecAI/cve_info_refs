|  | |

There are multiple TOCOU bugs in extension the scheduler of extension content scripts that allow extensions to run content scripts in principals that it should not have access to.
TOCTOU bug 1:
When an extension is just installed, or when a content process starts up,
injectExtensionScripts is called to run content scripts in existing pages.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/extension-process-script.js#202-221>
It first checks matchesWindow and then runs scripts in three batches, document\_start, document\_end and document\_idle. There is no guarantee that the inner window has not changed.
TOCTOU bug 2:
When a new document is loaded, ExtensionPolicyService::CheckContentScripts checks whether a script should run via script->Matches(aDocInfo), and then loads a script via loadContentScript:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionPolicyService.cpp#338-354>
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/extension-process-script.js#499-503>
The problem is that aDocInfo has a fixed value, while the document is not guaranteed to have a constant value.
TOCTOU bug 3:
When a dynamic content script is executed (via "Extension:Execute" message), there is no check that the extension is still valid (i.e. not disabled or reloaded). Consequently, it is possible for a dynamic content script to execute after having uninstalled an add-on.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2466b82b/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionContent.jsm#865-876>
In short:
- TOCTOU bug 1 and 2 allows extensions to escalate privileges.
- TOCTOU 3 allows extensions to run code after an extension is disabled (any of these bug do).
Bug 1 was introduced in Firefox 57 by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ce17d1d232f1>
Bug 2 was introduced in Firefox 55 by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/32a3b7c39207>
ESR 52 is not affected (tested with 52.9), ESR 60 and current release branches are affected.

STR:
1. Load attached extension at about:debugging.
2. Visit example.com
3. A dialog appears. If the dialog is not automatically closed after the navigation completes, close the dialog.
4. Wait until the new navigation (addons.mozilla.org) has finished.
Expected:
= No additional dialogs.
Actual:
- Dialog with: "Managed to run script at <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/>
If you don't see the actual result, try navigating back to example.com (and refresh the page).

The first paragraph of the bug looks unintelligible. It should read:
> There are multiple time of check to time to use (TOCTOU) bugs in the scheduler of extension content scripts that allow an extension to run content scripts in principals that it should not have access to.Summary: TOCTOU enables extensions to run content scripts anywhere → Extensions can run content scripts anywhere when the document navigates during content script execution

I'm going to address the third bug as part of [bug 1346941](/show_bug.cgi?id=1346941 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - tabs.executeScript() 'frameId' and 'allFrames' are mutually exclusive"), because it has no significant security impact\* and the relevant code needs to be refactored anyway.
\* The third part of the bug is a race condition that allows extensions to run content scripts after an extension has shut down, but only in pages where extensions already had the permission to do so. Extensions already have this capability (they can simply inject a script in a web page).

This has been fixed on trunk by [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++"):
- "TOCTOU bug 1" fixed by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a7848dcb339e>
- "TOCTOU bug 2" fixed by <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/eef3785a6b44>
(this second fix still leaves open one (non-security?) bug though: The second loop uses aDocInfo.GetWindow() again even though the inner window might have changed.).

Verified fixed in Firefox 63, buildID 20180827220123 .
I want to uplift a fix to Beta and ESR because the bug is easy to exploit and allows extensions to escalate privileges (and even run code on AMO).
The changes from [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++") are however too large for uplifting, so try a minimal fix such as [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Extensions can run content scripts anywhere when the document navigates during content script execution").

esr60 will need manual qa using the extension. I've verified the fix with the extension on esr60. The test patch will only apply and work on nightly.

r=mixedpuppy at <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D3772> , but this r+ is somehow not mirrored here.
[ESR Uplift Approval Request]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration: Privilege escalation in extensions; extensions can run code on any website.
User impact if declined: Extensions with minimal permissions can run JavaScript code on any website, even privileged websites such as addons.mozilla.org .
Fix Landed on Version: 63
Risk to taking this patch: Low
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): The cpp changes from the patch have already landed in 63 in [bug 1484373](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484373 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move more content-side framework logic to C++"). The JS-specific part has not, but its correctness was verified using the automated test in 63.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: none

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-27

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.3

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

#### [#CVE-2018-12389: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3](#CVE-2018-12389)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
low
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-27

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.3

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1478843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1478843)

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

##### References

* [Bug 1492823](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1492823)

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

* [Bug 1495011](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011)

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

##### References

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

#### [#CVE-2018-12389: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3](#CVE-2018-12389)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
low
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Bob Owen, Boris Zbarsky, Calixte Denizet, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Taegeon Lee, Philipp, Ronald Crane, Raul Gurzau, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Raymond Forbes, and Bogdan Tara reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

SameSite cookies, bypass mixed content warnings, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-12388](/security/CVE-2018-12388), [CVE-2018-12390](/security/CVE-2018-12390), [CVE-2018-12392](/security/CVE-2018-12392), [CVE-2018-12393](/security/CVE-2018-12393),

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))

I think the immediate solution here is to either
a. Require that an extension that tries to rewrite the Host header have a host/origin permission for the target, or
b. Just forbid rewriting the Host header altogether
An audit of standard HTTP headers to look for other places that could be similarly abused would be good too...

The only two standard headers I see that might have any impact would be host and origin. Host can be used by bypass extension permissions in specific situations, but I think it really only matters in the case of our restricted domains.

I don't see why changing the Origin header is a problem.
In any case, why do you think this only matters for restricted domains? An extension of course needs to have a host permission for the original host, as I said in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Domain fronting\" by rewriting Host header with webRequest") I think it should also have a host permission for the value it is changing to, otherwise it can cause something to be cached for a host it does not have permission for.

The problem with the Host request header is that it can result in a (cached) response for a completely different website (served by the same server infrastructure).
There are two problems with that:
1) An extension can persistently poison the cache for the site for which it has permissions.
2) An extension can read the response of the site for which it does not have permissions.
The Origin request header does not have this issue; the worst that can happen is that somehow a server mistakenly believes that a request comes from another domain. But this is outside the scope of extensions. An extension can also strip the Origin header and the site would have to believe that this is a same-origin request, send a request directly, or from a content script.

In addition to [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Domain fronting\" by rewriting Host header with webRequest"), we need tests.
Depending on what sort of sec classification this gets, they may need to be a separate patch.

I guess that I feel like a permission for an alternate host doesn't really address anything, the cache could still be messed up. Users are not going to understand that situation enough to notice that an extension could do this. OTOH it probably doesn't matter.
Denying setting host altogether feels too heavy handed, there could be entirely valid reasons to set host.
Maybe dveditz can chime in here as well.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I'm finding this kind of hard to follow. It looks like you're trying to implement something general that can be extended later to other headers, but its not clear to me that we'll ever need that (if we do, I think that would be the time to implement the general solution). In any case, with the current implementation you need to make a distinction between headers on a request and on a response, but this is done by passing `opts` on requests and not on responses. If we're keeping the general approach, lets just always pass opts and add a property to opts to distinguish requests from responses. But I would prefer just replacing the general `checkRestrictedHeaderValue` with a more targeted check for the Host header in requests.
Also still missing a test.

It is actually determined by only implementing support for this in the RequestHeaderChanger class and not the ResponseHeaderChangerClass. That's why I don't pass it for the response headers.

I guess checking against the listener filters is not really necessary, but it basically treats this like the rest of the api: permission and filter need to overlap.

That's awkward and confusing. This code is overly general, why not just pass the extension down to setHeader() unconditionally

This is going to instantiate an nsIURI internally, duplicating the construction done on line 157. Please build just a single instance and pass it both here and to isRestrictedURI below

Thanks, I do think that is clearer. Just one last nit: I think that `checkRestrictedHeaderValue` could be named to something more specific (eg checkHostHeader or something).
Since this doesn't have a security classification yet, don't forget to get sec-approval before landing.

probably because this is really old code. But since you just care about the Host header, why do you need to iterate over all the headers here?

prevent setting host to restricted domains or without permission
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? easy, but has to be targeted at domains on shared ip
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? probably, not certain how big a problem this issue is though.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? We could probably get this onto esr 60 and uplift to beta, not certain it's worth trying to backport to anything else
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? If there are any valid use cases for changing the host header those extensions will suffer

This bug is not properly fixed, because you're checking for lowercase "host". The header comparison should be case-insensitive.
The original test case from [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1465094#c1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1465094#c1 "NEW - Consider removing domain restrictions for fetch/XMLHttpRequest") still shows that the bug can be exploited.Flags: needinfo?(mixedpuppy)

We should probably get Beta and ESR60 uplift requests on this too. It grafts cleanly as-landed to both. And yeah, let's move tests to a follow-up bug at this point since this bug's history is already a bit messy.

extension from 1465094#c1 for QE, STR is:
Load the extension in Firefox, and the extension will try to read <https://addons.mozilla.org/robots.txt>
Expected result ("Without domain fronting"):
Failed to fetch: TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.
Actual result ("With domain fronting"):
(the actual response of AMO/robots.txt)

As discussed with QE on slack, the "without domain fronting" link in the test hits a cors error and will not complete. I think that is fine, the important fix is that "with domain fronting" gets the network error. Prior to the last patch here, that request completes (you see robots.txt). With the last patch here, you get the network error.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
Björn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.
