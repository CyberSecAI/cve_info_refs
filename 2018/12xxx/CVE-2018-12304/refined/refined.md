The provided content is related to CVE-2018-12304.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application manager in Seagate NAS OS fails to sanitize user-provided input for several application fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript by injecting malicious code into the application's fields.
- The injected JavaScript is executed when a user interacts with the affected app in the App Manager.
- The attacker can potentially hijack a user's session due to missing cookie hardening flags.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the following app fields:
  - Short Description (hover over app in App Manager)
  - Publisher Name (open app details)
  - Publisher Contact (open app details)
  - Website URL (open app details)
- The user must interact with the affected app in the App Manager, by hovering or opening the details.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious application package with injected Javascript within the application fields mentioned above.
- The attacker can then upload the malicious application or publish it on the store to trick a user into installing it.
