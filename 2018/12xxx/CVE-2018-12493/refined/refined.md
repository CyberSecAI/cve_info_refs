Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `cmsWebFile/list.html` and `cmsTemplate/content.html` endpoints within the PublicCMS application. The application does not correctly handle the `path` parameter, allowing attackers to manipulate it for directory traversal and arbitrary file reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application allows an attacker to use `../` sequences in the `path` parameter to navigate to directories outside of the intended scope. This allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and access arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem.
- **Arbitrary File Read:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can specify arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files, and read their content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive system files like `.bash_history`, application configuration files, database credentials, and other confidential information.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Access to sensitive information may allow attackers to gain further access to the system, escalate privileges, or compromise other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The vulnerable parameters are: `path`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server where PublicCMS is hosted.
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to have a valid session (login with demo account) to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

The content includes two Proof-of-Concept (POC) examples:

1.  **Directory Traversal POC:**
    ```
    GET /admin/cmsWebFile/list.html?path=../../../../../root&_=1529029023591 HTTP/1.1
    Host: cms.publiccms.com
    ...
    ```
    This request attempts to traverse up several directory levels to reach the root directory.
2.  **Arbitrary File Read POC:**
    ```
    GET /admin/cmsTemplate/content.html?path=../../../../../../../../../root/.bash_history&_=1529029023587 HTTP/1.1
    Host: cms.publiccms.com
    ...
    ```
    This request uses directory traversal to access and read the `.bash_history` file in the root directory.
