{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The smart contract used `keccak256()` to generate random numbers with publicly readable parameters: a private variable `_seed`, `blockhash(block.number-1)`, `block.coinbase`, and `block.difficulty`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of predictable inputs for random number generation in a smart contract.",
      "Exposing the seed and other parameters used for random number generation."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could predict the random numbers and win the gambling game, gaining unauthorized rewards.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct interaction with the smart contract using a crafted exploit contract to predict and exploit the predictable random number generation."
      ],
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to deploy and interact with Ethereum smart contracts."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present in the 'All For One' Ethereum gambling game. The `draw()` function, which determines the winner, used a vulnerable random number generation method. The parameters used in the random number generation were all publicly readable from the Ethereum blockchain, allowing an attacker to predict the random outcome."
