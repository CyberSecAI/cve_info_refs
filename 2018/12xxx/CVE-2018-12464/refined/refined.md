Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-12464

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability within the Micro Focus Secure Messaging Gateway (SMG) application. Specifically, user-supplied parameters are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameter binding, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** A publicly accessible endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.
2.  **Stacked Queries Enabled:** The database configuration allows the execution of stacked SQL queries, enabling multiple SQL statements in a single request.
3. **Insecure password handling**: The application uses a custom password hashing algorithm that relies on a static private key. By manipulating the password storage method for a newly created user, the attacker can bypass the password check with an empty string.
4.  **Authenticated Command Injection:** A separate, authenticated endpoint is vulnerable to command injection. This endpoint takes data from the database and uses it to construct and execute operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Arbitrary SQL Statement Execution**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements against the database.
2.  **Administrative Account Creation**: Using the SQL injection, an attacker can create a new administrative account.
3. **Authentication Bypass**: The attacker can bypass the login process for the newly created account by manipulating how password is validated.
4.  **Remote Code Execution**: By combining the SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
5.  **Compromise of the SMG server:** The attacker can execute OS commands in the context of the web server user, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable API endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code through the `appkey` parameter. This allows the attacker to create a new user and control database entries.
2.  **Command Injection:** After creating an administrator account and logging in, the attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the command injection endpoint `manage_domains_dkim_keygen_request.php` with a manipulated `DkimRecordId`, triggering the execution of attacker-supplied code in the command.
3. **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker bypasses the login process by setting the password storage method of the newly created user to a value different than `securemd5`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SMG server.
2.  **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the SQL injection and achieve initial access. However, they need to create a user and authenticate to exploit the command injection.
3.  **Exploit Development Skills:** Ability to craft SQL injection payloads and understand the application logic to create a valid user and trigger the command injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in MicroFocus Secure Messaging Gateway versions prior to 471.
- The exploit chain involves using an unauthenticated SQL injection to create a user with specific attributes, authenticating with this user by exploiting the insecure password check, and then leveraging an authenticated command injection vulnerability to achieve remote code execution.
- The provided Metasploit module automates the entire process, demonstrating the ease of exploitation.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 471 and later.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-12464.
- The exploit chain also involves a separate, related command injection vulnerability assigned CVE-2018-12465.
