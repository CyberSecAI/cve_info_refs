- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The smartphone name is not properly sanitized and is reflected unfiltered in the Bose Soundtouch app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80) due to lack of input validation and proper sanitization of the device name.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Malicious JavaScript code can be executed within a user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the interface.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the user connecting a device with a malicious name to the Bose Soundtouch app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to set the name of an iOS device to a malicious string (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) and then connect this device to the Bose Soundtouch app. The attacker has to be in the position of a user connecting a device to the app.
