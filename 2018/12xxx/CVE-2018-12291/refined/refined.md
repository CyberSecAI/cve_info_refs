The provided content relates to CVE-2018-12291.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `get_missing_events` federation API within the `on_get_missing_events` function in `handlers/federation.py` of Matrix Synapse. Specifically, event visibility rules were not correctly applied.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is the improper application of event visibility rules within the `get_missing_events` API. This allows potentially unauthorized access to event data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation could lead to unauthorized disclosure of event data, as visibility rules were not enforced. The impact is high confidentiality since the attacker can read private messages.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the federation API of Matrix Synapse.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to interact with a vulnerable Matrix Synapse server over the network using the federation API. No special privileges or user interaction is required.
