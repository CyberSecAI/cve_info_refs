Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A side-channel vulnerability existed in the ECDSA signature operation. This was due to the modular inverse algorithm used during signing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The modular inverse algorithm had input-dependent loops, leading to timing variations that could be exploited through side-channel attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker could potentially recover the secret ECDSA key by analyzing the timing variations during the signature process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through side-channel attacks, specifically by measuring the time taken to compute ECDSA signatures.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be local to the system performing the ECDSA signature operation. They must be capable of measuring the timing differences during the signing process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 2.5.0 of the library and fixed in 2.7.0. Versions before 2.5.0 were not affected, and the 1.10 branch was also unaffected.
- The provided diff shows that the fix involved changes to both ECDSA and DSA signature operations, likely to mitigate the side channel through blinding.
- The commit message "Address DSA/ECDSA side channel" and the security advisory confirm that both DSA and ECDSA were vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
