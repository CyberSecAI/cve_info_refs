  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The smart contract used a predictable source of randomness to generate game items and champ characteristics.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The random number generation relied on `keccak256` hashing of a private variable `randNonce` and `blockhash(block.number-1)` which were publicly accessible.",
      "Private variables in smart contracts are not truly private, their storage locations can be accessed using web3.eth.getStorageAt().",
       "The blockhash of previous blocks is public and can be read from within smart contracts or externally."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could predict the random numbers generated and create powerful in-game items or champions with high attack and defence.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Precompute the random number by using `randNonce` and `blockhash(block.number-1)`.",
      "Deploy a smart contract to precompute the random number internally."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needed to deploy a separate smart contract to precompute random numbers, and enough gas to send transactions repeatedly until a favorable number was generated."
