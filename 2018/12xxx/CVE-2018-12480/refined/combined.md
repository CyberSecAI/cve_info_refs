* [Support for the Form Post Response For Authorization Endpoint](#t45kxdszn8jp)
* [The JSON Web Key Set Endpoint Includes Optional Parameters](#t47byj5a8laz)
* [Support for Managing Token Revocation](#t47dfz7gbsdh)
* [Access Manager OAuth Application Developer Guide](#t47qvr0nki8f)

#### Support for the Form Post Response For Authorization Endpoint

This release supports the Form Post Response mode to return the response parameters, such as code, id\_token, token, and state, as HTML form parameters to redirect\_uri.

#### The JSON Web Key Set Endpoint Includes Optional Parameters

Along with the existing parameters, the JSON Web Key Set endpoint displays the optional parameters to comply with [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).

#### Support for Managing Token Revocation

A new option, Token Revocation is added to the OAuth Global Settings to manage the token revocation feature. By default, this option is enabled.

For more information about this option, see Token Revocation under [Defining Global Settings](../../admin/data/b65ogn0.html#oauth_global_settings) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 4.4 Administration Guide](../../admin/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

#### Access Manager OAuth Application Developer Guide

In addition to the existing deliverables, this release introduces the [Access Manager OAuth Application Developer Guide](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/access-manager-44-developer-documentation/oauth-application-developer-guide/data/bookinfo.html) in the developer documentation library.

The Access Manager OAuth Application Developer Guide is intended for client developers. This guide provides the information to help you build an OAuth-based client application when using Access Manager as the authorization server.

### 1.2 Operating System Upgrade

In addition to the existing supported platforms, this release adds support for RHEL 6.10.

*NOTE:*For more information about system requirements, see [System Requirements](../../install_upgrade/data/t42hx1gulrw3.html#t42hx1gulrw3) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 4.4 Installation and Upgrade Guide](../../install_upgrade/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.3 Updates for Dependent Components

This release adds support for the following dependent components:

* eDirectory 9.1.1
* Java 1.8.0-181
* Apache 2.4.34
* OpenSSL 1.0.2n
* Tomcat 8.5.32
* iManager 3.1.1.1

### 1.4 Software Fixes

This release includes software fixes for the following components:

* [Administration Console](#t45nyef51u71)
* [Identity Server](#b1ao4d5o)
* [Access Gateway](#b1ao4jz4)

#### Administration Console

The following issue is fixed in Administration Console:

##### Creating a New Virtual Attribute Throws an Error

This issue occurs because the size of the VirtualAttributeXML object in eDirectory exceeds the limit of the current data type. (Bug 1094251)

#### Identity Server

The following issues are fixed in Identity Server:

* Zip Slip Vulnerability
* Vulnerability in Identity Server (CVE-2018-12480). For more information, see [TID 7023513](https://support.microfocus.com/kb/doc.php?id=7023513).
* Vulnerability while adding target query to SSO service in Identity Server (CVE-2018-17948). For more information, see [TID 7023530](https://support.microfocus.com/kb/doc.php?id=7023530).

* [OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow Fails After Upgrading to Access Manager 4.4 SP2](#t43zag6jj30b)
* [The Access Manager JSON Web Key Uses Incorrect Base64 Encoding](#t47ct9uis2g1)
* [The UserInfo Request Fails Even When the Token Is Valid](#t47dfz7gc03a)
* [Identity Server Does Not Redirect the User to the SAML 2.0 Service Provider](#t479rn2xftbp)
* [The SAML 2.0 Authentication Request Does Not Get Signed with SHA256 When Using SAML 2.0 Redirect Flow](#t479rn2xpuev)
* [Users Cannot Register their Devices If They Did Not Complete the Registration Process in the First Attempt](#t479rn2xj5or)
* [The X509 Dual Connector Contract Fails to Authenticate a User](#t479rn2xmi1t)

##### OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow Fails After Upgrading to Access Manager 4.4 SP2

OpenID connect authorization code flow gives an error because the nonce parameter is missing. (Bug 1102844)

##### The Access Manager JSON Web Key Uses Incorrect Base64 Encoding

Access Manager encodes the JWK values of the Keys parameter, such as n and e, by using the base64 encoding instead of base64URL encoding. This makes the Access Manager JSON Web key Set (JWKS) format non-compliant with [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). (Bug 1094264)

##### The UserInfo Request Fails Even When the Token Is Valid

The Access Manager UserInfo EndPoint and TokenInfo EndPoint do not recognize a valid access token and responds with the token invalid or token revoked message.

This is a random issue and occurs in an Identity Server cluster environment that includes multiple user store replica. (Bug 1104336)

##### Identity Server Does Not Redirect the User to the SAML 2.0 Service Provider

This issue occurs when an assertion is sent with a URL encoded RelayState value. (Bug 1100379)

##### The SAML 2.0 Authentication Request Does Not Get Signed with SHA256 When Using SAML 2.0 Redirect Flow

The SAML 2.0 redirect flow authentication request gets signed with SHA1 instead of SHA 256 when SAML2 SIGN METHODDIGEST SHA256 parameter is set to true.

This issue occurs because the default certificate private key algorithm is considered as SHA1 instead of SHA256. (Bug 1098908)

##### Users Cannot Register their Devices If They Did Not Complete the Registration Process in the First Attempt

Users are not able to register their devices if they cancel the process without specifying TOTP in the first attempt. When they retry to register, the registration page is not shown. This issue also occurs if a user enters an incorrect TOTP.

This issue occurs because TOTP authentication stores the secret key in the LDAP attribute without device registration. (Bug 1096821)

##### The X509 Dual Connector Contract Fails to Authenticate a User

In a cluster configuration, the JSESSIONID cookie of the proxy Identity Server is also sent with the intended cookie to the user's device. This prevents from identifying the correct session in the subsequent requests. (Bug 1092936)

#### Access Gateway

The following issues are fixed in Access Gateway:

* [Kerberos Constrained Delegation Fails in Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016](#t43z9chix424)
* [Cookies Created by Access Gateway Do Not Overwrite the Browser Cookies](#t47bazbqnydj)

##### Kerberos Constrained Delegation Fails in Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016

This issue occurs because TGS exchange between Access Gateway and Kerberos Distribution Center fails. (Bug 982954)

##### Cookies Created by Access Gateway Do Not Overwrite the Browser Cookies

A cookie created by Access Gateway using an Identify Injection policy does not overwrite a browser cookie with the same name. Both cookies are sent to the application. (Bug 1102883)

## 5.0 Known Issues

NetIQ Corporation strives to ensure our products provide quality solutions for your enterprise software needs. The following issues are currently being researched. If you need further assistance with any issue, please contact [Technical Support](http://www.netiq.com/support).

* [Section 5.1, Cannot Register a New Client Application](#t43zbaqjp9rq)
* [Section 5.2, Users Do Not Receive Voice OTP If They Did Not Specify the OTP in the First Attempt](#t47j9djd6uf3)
* [Section 5.3, The Advanced Authentication Chains Are Not Displayed When Creating a Method with Advanced Authentication Generic Class](#t47meijlz9hi)
* [Section 5.4, Converting a Secondary Administration Console into a Primary Console Fails](#t48ijuqi3xki)
* [Section 5.5, Identity Server Is Not Able to Connect to User Stores After Upgrading to Access Manager 4.4 SP3](#t48ijpl34jsk)

### 5.1 Cannot Register a New Client Application

*Issue:*
When a new client application is registered, a new object gets added to the eDirectory. When the number of registered client applications increases, the attribute storing the objects increases in size. This increase in size restricts further registration of the client application. This issue occurs when the number of client applications is approximately 650 or more. (Bug 1102902)

*Workaround:*
None.

### 5.2 Users Do Not Receive Voice OTP If They Did Not Specify the OTP in the First Attempt

*Issue:*
Users do not receive the voice OTP if they did not specify the OTP within the OTP period, in the first attempt. However, if they specify an incorrect OTP in the first attempt, then clicking Resend OTP sends a fresh voice OTP. (Bug 1097810)

*Workaround:*
Execute the contract again.

### 5.3 The Advanced Authentication Chains Are Not Displayed When Creating a Method with Advanced Authentication Generic Class

*Issue:*
When you create a method with the Advanced Authentication Generic class, the Advanced Authentication Chains field displays No Chains Configured and does not display the list of all the configured chains. This issue occurs after upgrading Access Manager from 4.3.3 or earlier supported versions to 4.4 or later. (Bug 1111616)

*Workaround:*
Recreate the endpoints.

Recreating the endpoints

1. Delete the existing endpoint from the Advanced Authentication server.
2. On the Access Manager Administration Console, click Devices > Identity Servers > Shared Settings > Advanced Authentication
3. In the Server Domain field, change the IP address of the Advanced Authentication server to a dummy IP address.

   For example, if the original IP address of Advanced Authentication server is 10.10.10.10, then change it to a dummy IP address such as, 10.10.20.20.
4. Verify if the same dummy IP address is updated in the config.xml file on all the nodes of the same Identity Server cluster.

   Log in to the Identity Server terminals of the same cluster and check if the /etc/aaplugin/config.xml file has changed the IP address to the dummy IP address.
5. Delete the /etc/aaplugin/config.xml files from all the nodes of Identity Server cluster.
6. On the Access Manager Administration Console, click Devices > Identity Servers > Shared Settings > Advanced Authentication
7. Specify the original IP address of the Advanced Authentication Server in the Server Domain field and apply the change.

   This updates the endpoints in the Advanced Authentication server.

   Verify that the config.xml file is created successfully on all the nodes of the Identity Server cluster.

### 5.4 Converting a Secondary Administration Console into a Primary Console Fails

*Issue:*
After converting the Secondary Administration Console to Primary Administration Console, the converted Administration Console does not work because it fails to communicate with other servers. (Bug 1122742)

*Workaround:*
None.

### 5.5 Identity Server Is Not Able to Connect to User Stores After Upgrading to Access Manager 4.4 SP3

*Issue:*
This issue occurs because there is an incorrect setting in the Tomcat Java options of JNDI. (Bug 1117444)

*Workaround:*
Perform the steps mentioned in [TID 7023648](https://support.microfocus.com/kb/doc.php?id=7023648).
