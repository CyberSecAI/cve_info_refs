- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap buffer overflow in `tinyexr::DecodePixelData` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to a read operation that exceeds the allocated memory boundary.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability leads to a heap buffer overflow, which can potentially cause crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution in the context of the application, depending on the nature of the overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted EXR image file. Specifically, the `LoadEXRImageFromFile` function is called, which in turn calls `DecodePixelData` function leading to the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted EXR file to the vulnerable application to trigger the overflow. The attacker does not require any elevated privileges beyond the ability to cause the application to process the malicious file.
