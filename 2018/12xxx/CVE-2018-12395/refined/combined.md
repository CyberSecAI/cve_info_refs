I think the immediate solution here is to either
a. Require that an extension that tries to rewrite the Host header have a host/origin permission for the target, or
b. Just forbid rewriting the Host header altogether
An audit of standard HTTP headers to look for other places that could be similarly abused would be good too...

The only two standard headers I see that might have any impact would be host and origin. Host can be used by bypass extension permissions in specific situations, but I think it really only matters in the case of our restricted domains.

I don't see why changing the Origin header is a problem.
In any case, why do you think this only matters for restricted domains? An extension of course needs to have a host permission for the original host, as I said in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Domain fronting\" by rewriting Host header with webRequest") I think it should also have a host permission for the value it is changing to, otherwise it can cause something to be cached for a host it does not have permission for.

The problem with the Host request header is that it can result in a (cached) response for a completely different website (served by the same server infrastructure).
There are two problems with that:
1) An extension can persistently poison the cache for the site for which it has permissions.
2) An extension can read the response of the site for which it does not have permissions.
The Origin request header does not have this issue; the worst that can happen is that somehow a server mistakenly believes that a request comes from another domain. But this is outside the scope of extensions. An extension can also strip the Origin header and the site would have to believe that this is a same-origin request, send a request directly, or from a content script.

In addition to [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"Domain fronting\" by rewriting Host header with webRequest"), we need tests.
Depending on what sort of sec classification this gets, they may need to be a separate patch.

I guess that I feel like a permission for an alternate host doesn't really address anything, the cache could still be messed up. Users are not going to understand that situation enough to notice that an extension could do this. OTOH it probably doesn't matter.
Denying setting host altogether feels too heavy handed, there could be entirely valid reasons to set host.
Maybe dveditz can chime in here as well.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I'm finding this kind of hard to follow. It looks like you're trying to implement something general that can be extended later to other headers, but its not clear to me that we'll ever need that (if we do, I think that would be the time to implement the general solution). In any case, with the current implementation you need to make a distinction between headers on a request and on a response, but this is done by passing `opts` on requests and not on responses. If we're keeping the general approach, lets just always pass opts and add a property to opts to distinguish requests from responses. But I would prefer just replacing the general `checkRestrictedHeaderValue` with a more targeted check for the Host header in requests.
Also still missing a test.

It is actually determined by only implementing support for this in the RequestHeaderChanger class and not the ResponseHeaderChangerClass. That's why I don't pass it for the response headers.

I guess checking against the listener filters is not really necessary, but it basically treats this like the rest of the api: permission and filter need to overlap.

That's awkward and confusing. This code is overly general, why not just pass the extension down to setHeader() unconditionally

This is going to instantiate an nsIURI internally, duplicating the construction done on line 157. Please build just a single instance and pass it both here and to isRestrictedURI below

Thanks, I do think that is clearer. Just one last nit: I think that `checkRestrictedHeaderValue` could be named to something more specific (eg checkHostHeader or something).
Since this doesn't have a security classification yet, don't forget to get sec-approval before landing.

probably because this is really old code. But since you just care about the Host header, why do you need to iterate over all the headers here?

prevent setting host to restricted domains or without permission
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch? easy, but has to be targeted at domains on shared ip
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? probably, not certain how big a problem this issue is though.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? We could probably get this onto esr 60 and uplift to beta, not certain it's worth trying to backport to anything else
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? If there are any valid use cases for changing the host header those extensions will suffer

Making this a sec-moderate in discussion with Dveditz. As such, it doesn't need sec-approval to land on trunk so I'm clearing it.

This bug is not properly fixed, because you're checking for lowercase "host". The header comparison should be case-insensitive.
The original test case from [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1465094#c1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1465094#c1 "NEW - Consider removing domain restrictions for fetch/XMLHttpRequest") still shows that the bug can be exploited.Flags: needinfo?(mixedpuppy)

We should probably get Beta and ESR60 uplift requests on this too. It grafts cleanly as-landed to both. And yeah, let's move tests to a follow-up bug at this point since this bug's history is already a bit messy.

extension from 1465094#c1 for QE, STR is:
Load the extension in Firefox, and the extension will try to read <https://addons.mozilla.org/robots.txt>
Expected result ("Without domain fronting"):
Failed to fetch: TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.

As discussed with QE on slack, the "without domain fronting" link in the test hits a cors error and will not complete. I think that is fine, the important fix is that "with domain fronting" gets the network error. Prior to the last patch here, that request completes (you see robots.txt). With the last patch here, you get the network error.

The patch only affects Host headers.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

Fixed in

* Firefox 63

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

* [Bug 1487478](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487478)

#### [#CVE-2018-12398: CSP bypass through stylesheet injection in resource URIs](#CVE-2018-12398)

Reporter
cgvwzq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using the reflected URL in some special resource URIs, such as `chrome:`, it is possible to inject stylesheets and bypass Content Security Policy (CSP).

* [Bug 1488061](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488061)

#### [#CVE-2018-12402: WebBrowserPersist uses incorrect origin information](#CVE-2018-12402)

Reporter
Björn Ruytenberg, 1lastBr3ath
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The internal `WebBrowserPersist` code does not use correct origin context for a resource being saved. This manifests when sub-resources are loaded as part of "Save Page As..." functionality. For example, a malicious page could recover a visitor's Windows username and NTLM hash by including resources otherwise unreachable to the malicious page, if they can convince the visitor to save the complete web page. Similarly, SameSite cookies are sent on cross-origin requests when the "Save Page As..." menu item is selected to save a page, which can result in saving the wrong version of resources based on those cookies.

* [Bug 1469916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1469916)

#### [#CVE-2018-12399: Spoofing of protocol registration notification bar](#CVE-2018-12399)

Reporter
Mathias Wu
Impact
low
##### Description

When a new protocol handler is registered, the API accepts a title argument which can be used to mislead users about which domain is registering the new protocol. This may result in the user approving a protocol handler that they otherwise would not have.

#### [#CVE-2018-12400: Favicons are cached in private browsing mode on Firefox for Android](#CVE-2018-12400)

Reporter
Konark Modi
Impact
low
##### Description

In private browsing mode on Firefox for Android, favicons are cached in the `cache/icons` folder as they are in non-private mode. This allows information leakage of sites visited during private browsing sessions.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1448305](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1448305)

#### [#CVE-2018-12401: DOS attack through special resource URI parsing](#CVE-2018-12401)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Some special resource URIs will cause a non-exploitable crash if loaded with optional parameters following a '?' in the parsed string. This could lead to denial of service (DOS) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1422456](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422456)

#### [#CVE-2018-12403: Mixed content warning is not displayed when HTTPS page loads a favicon over HTTP](#CVE-2018-12403)

Reporter
Yiğit Can Yilmaz
Impact

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Dana Keeler, Ronald Crane, Marcia Knous, Tyson Smith, Daniel Veditz, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20100101
Steps to reproduce:
The issue is in ScriptLoader::ConvertToUTF16 (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/script/ScriptLoader.cpp>) :
CheckedInt<size\_t> unicodeLength =
unicodeDecoder->MaxUTF16BufferLength(aLength);
if (!unicodeLength.isValid()) {
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
}
aBufOut =
static\_cast<char16\_t\*>(js\_malloc(unicodeLength.value() \* sizeof(char16\_t)));
if (!aBufOut) {
aLengthOut = 0;
return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
}
At line 2826, unicodeLength is calculated and sanitized against an integer overflow via the CheckedInt class. However just a few lines below, the raw value of unicodeLength (unicodeLength.value()) is multiplied by 2 (=sizeof(char16\_t)) and thus can cause an overflow! In such case js\_malloc will allocate a smaller buffer than required, will all the usual arbitrary out-of-bounds write consequences.
It's not clear whether any checks in the (multiple) callers sanitize away the overflow window, however the fact that this code uses the CheckedInt class strongly suggests that either it has overflowed in the past, or it has a potential for the overflow.
I checked the crash stats and they do contain quite a few bugs around this code, but maybe not all of them due to this specific issue.

Indeed we shouldn't trust the callers not to pass values that can't overflow. I'll fix this.
At least we know there won't be overflow in 64-bit builds.

Note that MaxUTF16BufferLength() returns CheckedInt<size\_t>, so it's not an indication of past overflow at this particular place in the code. (Indeed, MaxUTF16BufferLength() returning CheckedInt<size\_t> also explains why a mass refactoring resulted in seemingly silly code.)Assignee: nobody → hsivonenStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(hsivonen)

[Bug 1495011](/show_bug.cgi?id=1495011 "RESOLVED FIXED - Unsafe use of CheckedInt (possible buffer overflow) in ScriptLoader::ConvertToUTF16").
[Security Approval Request]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?: Depends on details in the various callers. I haven't analyzed the callers well enough to say.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?: Yes
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?: all
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?: [Bug 987556](/show_bug.cgi?id=987556 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Sora][IOT][Web]The device does not execute Rightware's Browsermark (2.0) benchmark on \"browsermark.rightware.com\"")
Do you have backports for the affected branches?: No
If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?: Either the same patch applies or the backport is trivial.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?: Extremely unlikely to cause regressions, since it affects cases where an unsigned 32-bit integer would overflow. (In 32-bit builds only; 64-bit builds are unaffected.)

Feature/Bug causing the regression: [Bug 987556](/show_bug.cgi?id=987556 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Sora][IOT][Web]The device does not execute Rightware's Browsermark (2.0) benchmark on \"browsermark.rightware.com\"")
User impact if declined: There might exist (not verified either way) a way to cause out-of-bounds write in 32-bit builds. The impact would be the general consequences of out-of-bounds write.
Is this code covered by automated tests?: No
Has the fix been verified in Nightly?: No
Needs manual test from QE?: No
If yes, steps to reproduce:
List of other uplifts needed: None
Risk to taking this patch: Low
Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky): The change is not risky, because it merely adds an integer overflow check and shouldn't affect cases that don't overflow.
String changes made/needed: None

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3

Announced
October 23, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 60.3

#### [#CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data is accessible cross-origin](#CVE-2018-12391)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
high
##### Description

During HTTP Live Stream playback on Firefox for Android, audio data can be accessed across origins in violation of security policies. Because the problem is in the underlying Android service, this issue is addressed by treating all HLS streams as cross-origin and opaque to access.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Desktop versions of Firefox are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops](#CVE-2018-12392)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

When manipulating user events in nested loops while opening a document through script, it is possible to trigger a potentially exploitable crash due to poor event handling.

#### [#CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript](#CVE-2018-12393)

Reporter
R at Zero Day LLC
Impact
high
##### Description

A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write.
*Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12395: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting](#CVE-2018-12395)

Reporter
Rob Wu, Andrew Swan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.

* [Bug 1467523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467523)

#### [#CVE-2018-12396: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts](#CVE-2018-12396)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability where a WebExtension can run content scripts in disallowed contexts following navigation or other events. This allows for potential privilege escalation by the WebExtension on sites where content scripts should not be run.

##### References

* [Bug 1483602](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1483602)

#### [#CVE-2018-12397: Missing warning prompt when WebExtension requests local file access](#CVE-2018-12397)

Reporter
Rob Wu
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A WebExtension can request access to local files without the warning prompt stating that the extension will "Access your data for all websites" being displayed to the user. This allows extensions to run content scripts in local pages without permission warnings when a local file is opened.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Daniel Veditz and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-3801-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 October 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, bypass CSP

restrictions, spoof the protocol registration notification bar, leak

SameSite cookies, bypass mixed content warnings, or execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-12388](/security/CVE-2018-12388), [CVE-2018-12390](/security/CVE-2018-12390), [CVE-2018-12392](/security/CVE-2018-12392), [CVE-2018-12393](/security/CVE-2018-12393),

[CVE-2018-12398](/security/CVE-2018-12398), [CVE-2018-12399](/security/CVE-2018-12399), [CVE-2018-12401](/security/CVE-2018-12401), [CVE-2018-12402](/security/CVE-2018-12402),

[CVE-2018-12403](/security/CVE-2018-12403))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions in Firefox.

If a user were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an

attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass domain restrictions,

gain additional privileges, or run content scripts in local pages without

permission. ([CVE-2018-12395](/security/CVE-2018-12395), [CVE-2018-12396](/security/CVE-2018-12396), [CVE-2018-12397](/security/CVE-2018-12397))

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser, designed for standards compliance, performance, and portability.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 60.3.0 ESR.

Security Fix(es):

* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 63 and Firefox ESR 60.3 (CVE-2018-12390)
* Mozilla: Crash with nested event loops (CVE-2018-12392)
* Mozilla: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript (CVE-2018-12393)
* Mozilla: WebExtension bypass of domain restrictions through header rewriting (CVE-2018-12395)
* Mozilla: WebExtension content scripts can execute in disallowed contexts (CVE-2018-12396)
* Mozilla: WebExtension local file permission check bypass (CVE-2018-12397)
* Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox ESR 60.3 (CVE-2018-12389)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Bob Owen, Boris Zbarsky, Calixte Denizet, Jason Kratzer, Jed Davis, Taegeon Lee, Philipp, Ronald Crane, Raul Gurzau, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Raymond Forbes, Bogdan Tara, Nils, r, Rob Wu, Andrew Swan, and Daniel Veditz as the original reporters.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, passwords saved in the Firefox browser and encrypted by a master password were erased when Firefox was exited.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
