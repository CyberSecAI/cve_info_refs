{
  "CVE-2018-12395": {
    "description": "By rewriting the `Host` request headers using the `webRequest` API, a WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions through domain fronting. This would allow access to domains that share a host that are otherwise restricted.",
    "root_cause": "The webRequest API allows modification of the Host header, which can be exploited for domain fronting, bypassing permission checks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "WebExtension can rewrite Host header.",
      "Domain restriction bypass via domain fronting."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious WebExtension can bypass domain restrictions, potentially accessing restricted domains by manipulating the Host header and causing responses from unintended websites to be returned.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Installation of a malicious WebExtension.",
      "Manipulation of the Host header using the webRequest API."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create and install a WebExtension.",
         "Knowledge of the webRequest API."
