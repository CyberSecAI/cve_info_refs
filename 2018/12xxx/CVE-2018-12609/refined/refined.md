Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12609:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the processing of specific XML tags within PowerPoint presentations by the document converter component. These tags could be crafted to trigger network requests on the server side during document conversion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The document converter was vulnerable to SSRF by allowing crafted XML within a PPTX file to initiate network requests to arbitrary internal endpoints. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization and validation of URLs within document XML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Reconnaissance:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to access internal network endpoints. The response of these endpoints would then be exposed to the attacker, giving them information about internal network services.
- **Timing Attacks:** Attackers can use the timing of the responses to the network requests to further probe internal systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker would need to create a malicious PowerPoint (PPTX) file containing specific XML tags.
- **Triggering Document Conversion:** The attacker would then need to upload the crafted PPTX to the Open-Xchange AppSuite and trigger the document preview function, which initiates the conversion process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** An attacker needs to be a user with the ability to upload files and trigger a document preview on the Open-Xchange AppSuite, meaning they would require a valid account on the platform.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by blocking all external references during document conversion. This included blocking file system level access and other kinds of external URL references.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Open-Xchange AppSuite backend versions 7.8.4-rev5, 7.8.3-rev7, and 7.6.3-rev4.
- The vulnerability was reported by Secator.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
