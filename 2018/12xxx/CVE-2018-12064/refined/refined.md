Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2018-12064:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow within the `tinyexr::ReadChannelInfo` function. This occurs when parsing the header of a malformed EXR file, specifically while reading channel information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `ReadChannelInfo` function attempts to read data past the allocated buffer on the heap leading to the overflow. The vulnerability is triggered due to insufficient bounds checking within the parsing logic of the EXR header. Specifically, the `ReadAttribute` and `ReadChannelInfo` functions fail to correctly handle the parsing of the channel information leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario as the application processing the malicious EXR file will terminate unexpectedly.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Though not explicitly stated, a heap-buffer-overflow can potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks such as arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts the malicious input. This would depend on the specifics of the memory layout and how the overflow can corrupt other data on the heap.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious EXR File:** An attacker crafts a specially designed, malicious EXR file that contains an improperly formatted channel information section within the header. This can be achieved by modifying the size or content of the channel information attributes.
- **File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to load and parse the malicious EXR file, specifically when it calls `LoadEXR`, which eventually leads to calls to `ParseEXRHeaderFromFile`, `ParseEXRHeader`, `ReadAttribute`, and `ReadChannelInfo`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File injection:** The attacker needs the ability to inject a crafted EXR file that will be processed by the vulnerable application. This can occur when an application loads a user provided file.
- **Understanding of EXR structure:** The attacker would benefit from understanding the structure of the EXR file format, particularly the layout of the header and channel information.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
