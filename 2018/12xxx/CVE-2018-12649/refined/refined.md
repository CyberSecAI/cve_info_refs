Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the brute-force protection mechanism in the `UsersController::login()` function of the MISP application only checked for blacklisted users when the request method was a `POST` request. It did not check for blacklisted users when the request method was a `PUT` request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Validation:** The application failed to consider `PUT` requests when implementing brute-force protection, leading to a bypass.
*   **HTTP Method Handling:** The application incorrectly assumed that login attempts would only come from `POST` requests, neglecting other methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Brute-Force Protection:** Attackers could bypass the brute-force protection by using `PUT` requests instead of `POST` requests.
*   **Password Guessing:** An attacker could attempt to log in with an unlimited number of attempts without being blocked.
*   **Account Compromise:** Successful brute-force attacks would lead to unauthorized access and account compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** Attacker sends HTTP PUT requests to the login endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
*   **Targeted User Email:** The attacker needs to know a target user's email to make an attempt.

**Technical Details:**

The code diff shows changes in the `app/Controller/UsersController.php` file:

**Before fix (vulnerable):**

```php
if ($this->request->is('post') && isset($this->request->data['User']['email'])) {
    if ($this->Bruteforce->isBlacklisted($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $this->request->data['User']['email'])) {
        throw new ForbiddenException(...);
    }
}
```
This code block only checks for blacklisted users on `POST` requests.

**After fix (patched):**

```php
if ($this->request->is('post') || $this->request->is('put')) {
  $this->Bruteforce = ClassRegistry::init('Bruteforce');
  if (!empty($this->request->data['User']['email'])) {
    if ($this->Bruteforce->isBlacklisted($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $this->request->data['User']['email'])) {
      throw new ForbiddenException('You have reached the maximum number of login attempts. Please wait ' . Configure::read('SecureAuth.expire') . ' seconds and try again.');
    }
  }
```
The fix modifies the condition to `if ($this->request->is('post') || $this->request->is('put'))` so it checks for blacklisted users on both `POST` and `PUT` requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit message explicitly states that the brute force protection can be bypassed with a PUT request.
*   The issue was reported by Silver Saks from CCDCOE.
