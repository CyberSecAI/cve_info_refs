Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12370:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox's Reader View handles "SameSite" cookies when exiting the Reader View. Specifically, when a user navigates away from Reader View back to the original page, the "site for cookies" is not correctly tracked or passed, causing SameSite cookie protection bypass. This issue arises due to the manual handling of meta redirects by Reader View, which makes it difficult to pass the correct triggering principal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SameSite cookie bypass:**  The primary weakness is the failure to maintain the correct "site for cookies" context when exiting Reader View. This allows cookies with `SameSite=Strict` to be sent when they should not be, which can lead to CSRF attacks.
- **Incorrect handling of navigation:** The Reader View's manual handling of meta redirects is identified as the root cause. It doesn't properly carry the triggering principal, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **CSRF attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious websites that exploit this behavior to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks on other sites.
- **Triggering of payloads:** A malicious site can load a payload into Reader View, and it will be triggered when the user exits the Reader View if navigation occurs.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious website that redirects the user to a target site within Reader View, using methods like meta refresh, or target blank with #.
- The user enters Reader View on the malicious site, and the malicious site navigates to the target site while still in reader view.
- When the user exits Reader View, the SameSite cookie protections are bypassed, and any associated CSRF payload on the target site will execute due to the missed triggering principal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create and host a malicious website:** The attacker needs to control a website to start a victim's browser in Reader View on the target website.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker might need to socially engineer a user to click on a link or perform some action to trigger Reader View on the malicious website.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was considered low severity due to the requirement of user interaction to trigger reader mode, and social engineering to get the user to exit Reader View.
- The fix involves ensuring the correct triggering principal is passed when exiting Reader View, thereby respecting the SameSite cookie policy.
- The issue was addressed in Firefox 61 and ESR 60.1, and it is not present in Firefox ESR 52.
- This vulnerability is linked to bug 1456652 in Mozilla's Bugzilla.
