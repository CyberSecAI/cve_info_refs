User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_13\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.117 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://test.shhnjk.com/read_bypass.html>
2. Click reader view icon
3. Click on "Click ME" link
4. Exit Reader view in new tab
Actual results:
SameSite cookie not sent.
Expected results:
SameSite cookie is sent when exiting Reader view at the end.
Firefox doesn't fully track "Site for cookie" when exiting Reader view. Using various tricks in Reader view (target blank with # and meta refresh), attacker can start Reader view from attacker site and navigate to victim site without exiting Reader view. Which makes it possible to end in a state where Reader view holds CSRF payload within Reader view, and it is triggered when exiting Reader view.

This is because reader mode manually handles meta redirects by determining the URL and then navigating to it ( . There's no reasonable way to pass a triggering principal when doing that. ( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/26e53729a10976f52e75efa44e17b5e054969fec/toolkit/components/reader/AboutReader.jsm#659> )
Maybe we can switch the load to use the docshell directly, and then pass the correct information.

It turns out this is tricky because it essentially requires passing the information from the first reader mode page load to the next. I thought we could just set a triggering principal on the reader mode load, but that doesn't work because `<http://foo.com/>` isn't allowed to load about:reader?... (of course!).
So we need the triggering principal / URL in the next about:reader page that loads... We'd have to add another url parameter or something.
Alternatively, we could look at doing the fetch in the same page, and use history.replaceState() to update the URL bar and history entry (to the target of the redirect). However, I don't see a way to specify an explicit triggering principal for an XHR or fetch request initiated from JS. Am I just missing how to do that?

I might be wrong but I think what you need to figure out is that how not to forget "site for cookies" when exiting Reader view. If you test my PoC, SameSite cookie isn't sent when <https://shhnjk.azurewebsites.net/SameSite.php> is rendered in Reader view. SameSite cookie is only sent when user exit from Reader view.
So I think SameSite cookie is handled correctly inside Reader view, but not when exiting from Reader view.

Ah, I did some of my testing in an earlier version of 60 beta, which presumably didn't have some of the other fixes yet... I can reproduce what you're seeing now.
> So I think SameSite cookie is handled correctly inside Reader view, but not

Well... this is an interesting question. It amounts to whether the navigation from read:foo.com/site to foo.com/site is same-site or not. I think you could reasonably argue that it's same-site, but even if you don't think so, that this isn't a security issue as written.
My reasoning for the latter is as follows. Suppose you had a site (V) using same-site: strict for cookies, and site (A) tried to exploit a CSRF issue in (V) by sending people to a deep-link in (V). same-site cookies would stop this, because the deep-linked website wouldn't have cookies.
If (V) doesn't navigate when accessed without cookies (e.g. to an "authentication denied" or "something went wrong" style page with a different URL), then the URL in the URL bar would be the one (A) wanted it to be, right? But then, if the user went to the URL bar and hit enter to try to access the page again (because it "didn't work", whatever (A) promised would happen on (V) if they were trying to social engineer like you are here) then (V) \*would\* be exploited, because at this point it's just a user-requested access of the victim page, and same-site cookies won't help anymore (I'm assuming everyone agrees this is effectively by design, even if it may be considered unfortunate).
In the same vein, why is exiting reader mode here different from the user requesting the URL directly? And in particular, given that (A) has no control over the content of (V), how would you encourage the user to either hit 'enter' in the URL bar, or click "exit reader mode", rather than closing the tab (which after all is newly opened in this exploit...)?
To defend against any of this, I believe it ought to be considered good practice to have any access to a deep-link in same-site-cookie-protected (V) redirect to a "safe" page that tries to explain what happened to the user. I think that is what happens by design in lots of sites (e.g. bank sites or email accounts where the (hopefully same-site) cookies contain session information will redirect from deep-link pages to the sign-in page if accessed without cookies). Would you agree with that? If so, I believe the initial reader mode view here won't have cookies and would thus be redirected to the "safe" page, which would also avoid what happens in the steps from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1456652#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - SameSite cookie Reader view patch bypass") when exiting reader mode.
Anyway, it's possible to pass a triggering principal when exiting reader mode, at least, so that might help for the issue as written and be strictly more correct than what we do now, so I will try to write a patch for it. But I'm not convinced it's a security / same-site cookie issue in practice, per the above.Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)

I agree with this point that there's not much difference with social engineering victim to hit enter again...

Let's say attacker's payload is "<https://twitter.com/settings/account?payload>". Assuming that Twitter has SameSite Strict cookie in their session cookie, they will redirect to following URL when session is not present.
<https://twitter.com/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fsettings%2Faccount%3Fpayload>
When victim access above URL with session again (either by hit enter on address bar or exiting from Reader view), payload triggers anyway. Of course, this is just a case for Twitter and it depends on website.Flags: needinfo?(s.h.h.n.j.k)

Personally, I think this is a bug in Twitter's login support. They should probably validate the redirect URL, and as soon as they see any character outside /[0-9a-z\/.]/i strip that and everything that follows from the URL they put in redirect\_after\_login . It may be worth contacting them about this.
I'll attach a patch but I think we should open up this bug. Mark, let me know if you agree. :-)

Looks good. Should we add a testcase similar to toolkit/components/reader/test/browser\_bug1453818\_samesite\_cookie.js ? If so, I'll follow up.
Thanks!

Given where we are in the ESR60 lifecycle, is this something we should consider taking there too (yes, I'm aware of the severity)?

It's simple enough that I think that would work, yeah.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# USN-3705-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

5 July 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, read uninitialized

memory, bypass same-origin restrictions, bypass CORS restrictions,

bypass CSRF protections, obtain sensitive information, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5156](/security/CVE-2018-5156), [CVE-2018-5186](/security/CVE-2018-5186), [CVE-2018-5187](/security/CVE-2018-5187),

[CVE-2018-5188](/security/CVE-2018-5188), [CVE-2018-12358](/security/CVE-2018-12358), [CVE-2018-12359](/security/CVE-2018-12359), [CVE-2018-12360](/security/CVE-2018-12360),

[CVE-2018-12361](/security/CVE-2018-12361), [CVE-2018-12362](/security/CVE-2018-12362), [CVE-2018-12363](/security/CVE-2018-12363), [CVE-2018-12364](/security/CVE-2018-12364),

[CVE-2018-12365](/security/CVE-2018-12365), [CVE-2018-12366](/security/CVE-2018-12366), [CVE-2018-12367](/security/CVE-2018-12367), [CVE-2018-12370](/security/CVE-2018-12370),

[CVE-2018-12371](/security/CVE-2018-12371))

A security issue was discovered with WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to obtain full browser permissions.

([CVE-2018-12369](/security/CVE-2018-12369))

##### Description

In the previous mitigations for Spectre, the resolution or precision of various methods was reduced to counteract the ability to measure precise time intervals. In that work, `PerformanceNavigationTiming` was not adjusted but it was found that it could be used as a precision timer.

##### References

* [Bug 1462891](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462891)

#### [#CVE-2018-12368: No warning when opening executable SettingContent-ms files](#CVE-2018-12368)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12370: SameSite cookie protections bypassed when exiting Reader View](#CVE-2018-12370)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

In Reader View SameSite cookie protections are not checked on exiting. This allows for a payload to be triggered when Reader View is exited if loaded by a malicious site while Reader mode is active, bypassing CSRF protections.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

It appears there aren't any checks for bundled web extension experiments.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f65d7528e34ef1a7665b4a1a7b7cdb1388fcd3aa/toolkit/components/extensions/Extension.jsm#632> doesn't check for privileged permissions.
experimentsAllowed appears never to be used:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f65d7528e34ef1a7665b4a1a7b7cdb1388fcd3aa/toolkit/components/extensions/Extension.jsm#1355>
I compiled the code with isPrivileged and experimentsAllowed hard coded to return false. I was still able to load an XPI built by web-ext build which was a bundled experiment through about:debugging.
This was able to set preferences etc. Is there something I am missing here?

This appears that [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") wouldn't be needed currently as the code isn't used in the evaluation of if an extension can have an experiment.
If the idea is that an extension is filtered out by AMO then perhaps this is fine too?

I just submitted an unlisted addon to AMO and got lint errors: "experiments.rollout is not supported" but it did not reject signing on that.
I was able to install this signed XPI to release 59.0.1

This includes the check I had for [Bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") however I couldn't find a way to check the isSystem from this bit of code.
However it seemed like it would be good to bundle the patches together.

I just verified my patch still works as a temp addon in about:debugging but not installing through about:addons. (not that I am even sure if we want users to install an xpi as a temp addon and get this behaviour either)

OK, then. Please request beta uplift before you land so we can land on both channels at once. And please land this patch as part of the bug to allow experiments in system add-ons. If you can add a stealth test, so much the better.
We can watch for new signatures while that rolls out.

Is it possible to land the patch after [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") is resolved? How long would [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") take until it is deployed on AMO? The risk of detection would be much lower if AMO had been fixed up already.

|  | |

At this point, this only affects nightly and beta users, so there's not too much risk of this being exploited. I'd rather land the fix sooner than wait for AMO. We can always block any experiment extensions if they're signed in the meantime.

Oh, did it land in 59? That's unfortunate. It might make sense to land the AMO fix first, then, but I'd still lean towards watching and blocklisting. We should be able to block before any add-ons get significant distribution.

In general they shouldn't, but I want this landed as part of [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"), with tests. We should be able to add tests for all of the cases there without drawing attention to this one.

This should probably be something like installLocation.isSystem. Though maybe this makes more sense, since system add-ons in other location shoud be signed, anyway.
Still needs a test. Please submit that for review in [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"). I'd rather not draw atrention to that by reviewing out of band.

Could argue this is sec-high rather than sec-critical because there's a prompt, but you can make an extension look pretty innocuous.Blocks: [1323845](/show_bug.cgi?id=1323845 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow bundled experiments, and support for content-side APIs")

I spent a crazy amount of time failing to get any tests to work which I'm not really sure why.
Anyway my plan is to throw this into the [Bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") when we are happy with it to minimize noise in that bug.

CC'ing Lizzard to make sure this probable late 60 uplift is noted. Liz, there are plans to include this patch in the one for [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") (and then uplift together, I suppose).
I would also suggest downgrading this to sec-high since [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") was resolved and it's no longer a problem on release.

With [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") resolved, I think this is only sec-moderate.

bug-1454909.e.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not very, we now have mitigations in AMO
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
59+
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I plan to uplift, it should cleanly apply to 60.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The chance of regressions is low, we have more tests and the only "risk" is with system addons with experiments which currently don't exist.

My plan was now to move this patch into [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") and mark as uplift there, not mentioning anything security there in public view.
> does this resolve the issues mentioned by aswan...
Yeah I will override the patch there with this one.
So I will ask for :johannh's approval tomorrow on the other bug with the exact same patch, as he will be in the same room and we have the correct approvals here anyway.
Unless :lizzard it would be better to move this public as close to 60.0b16 as possible?Flags: needinfo?(jkt) → needinfo?(lhenry)

Just post the patch to the public bug now. It doesn't do anything to draw more attention it than it already has, and the routes to exploit have been closed by the AMO patches anyway.

Just to clarify [bug 1454820 comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"), which I left intentionally vague:
It's no longer possible to exploit this bug in release channels, since AMO will no longer sign extensions with embedded experiments, and release channels won't load unsigned extensions. So I don't think it's necessary to uplift the fix to 60.
That said, if we do plan to ship system add-ons with bundled experiments to 60, doing so without uplifting that patch would look suspicious, so in that case the uplift would probably still make sense.
Updating the severity to reflect the current state of affairs. This is no longer exploitable without an exploit on the AMO side which would cause it to sign these extensions, which makes it sec-moderate.Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)
