- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Certiport testing software runs with local administrator privileges to hook into Microsoft applications. When a user completes a practice test and chooses to view results locally, the software creates a PDF and opens it using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. This browser process inherits the parent software's administrator privileges. Opening the save dialog in this privileged child process allows access to the entire file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A child process of the testing software inherits administrator privileges and allows a user to open a save dialog with these privileges, leading to file system access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain local administrator access to the computer, which could be used to enable remote administration, create accounts, access network shares, and install malware.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. The vulnerability is triggered through the normal use of the software when opening a PDF of the test results after a practice test and then accessing the file save dialog.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be a user of the software, have taken a practice test, and have the ability to open the generated PDF in a vulnerable version of the software.
