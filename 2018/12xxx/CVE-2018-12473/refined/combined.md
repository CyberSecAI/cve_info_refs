| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-08-20 14:49:45 UTC  ``` from ludwig nussel via security.   Hi,  Not sure how much OBS isolates running services on server side, so I have no idea if the following actually is an issue in practice.  The tar_scm service may run on server side and "extract" files from git repos, eg: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS:Server:Unstable/obs-server/_service?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/OBS%3AServer%3AUnstable/obs-server/_service?expand=1)  Now check this: <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/blob/0732756ab35114049c5fb79c483d91e96217bcd8/TarSCM/archive.py#L32>  There doesn't seem to be any sanitizing on the extract argument up to that point. So in theory a user could specify relative paths in the extract argument to access files outside the repo. That's at least inconsistent with the handling of the 'subdir' argument which does get some sanitation: <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/blob/0732756ab35114049c5fb79c483d91e96217bcd8/TarSCM/cli.py#L127>  Hereby handing over to the experts for further investigation :-)  cu Ludwig ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c3)  Frank Schreiner   2018-08-22 07:08:21 UTC  ``` I created a PR on github to fix this issue  <https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm/pull/248>  Please be aware, that the short and generic commit message is for purpose.  @Marcus: Would you like to review my changes before merging? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2018-09-26 08:55:09 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2018-12473 for this issue. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-02-28 01:20:18 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1105361) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/679987> Factory / obs-service-tar_scm ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-02-28 11:30:17 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1105361) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/680081> 15.0+42.3 / obs-service-tar_scm ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1105361#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-04 20:55:53 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:0540-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

| normpath should only remove '..' which can be "resolved" in this path and if there is no attempt to access the parent dir, it might be an useless but still valid path definition  Example:  ``` >>> import os >>> # valid (even if useless) >>> fn = os.path.normpath('foo/../bar') >>> print(fn) bar >>> # invalid >>> fn = os.path.normpath('foo/../../bar') >>> print(fn) ../bar >>>   ``` |
