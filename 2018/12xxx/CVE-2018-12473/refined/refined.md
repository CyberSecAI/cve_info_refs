Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the `obs-service-tar_scm` service. The service extracts files from git repositories based on user-provided arguments. Specifically, the `--extract` argument was not properly sanitized, allowing users to specify relative paths that could potentially access files outside the intended repository directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the `--extract` argument, allowing path traversal using relative paths like `../` to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:**  An attacker could potentially read files on the server's filesystem that they should not have access to, by providing crafted paths in the `--extract` argument. The severity of the impact depends on the privileges of the user running the service and the content of the files accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted `--extract` argument:** An attacker provides a crafted `--extract` argument to the `obs-service-tar_scm` service, containing relative paths to access files outside the repository directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to influence or control the `--extract` argument to the `obs-service-tar_scm` service. This could be through manipulating the service configuration, or, depending on the service's design, through directly providing parameters to the service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved adding sanitization to the `--extract` argument using `os.path.normpath()` to collapse relative paths like "A/../B" to "B" and prevent access to parent directories using `..`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ludwig Nussel and fixed by Frank Schreiner (M0ses).
*   The vulnerability was addressed in multiple SUSE and openSUSE updates.
*   The bug report also highlights an earlier similar issue with the `subdir` argument, which did have some sanitization applied.
