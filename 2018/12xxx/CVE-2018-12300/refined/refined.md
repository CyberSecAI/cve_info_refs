{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Arbitrary redirect in `/www/echo-server.html`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly validate the redirect URL provided as a parameter in the `echo-server.html` page, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website that may impersonate the legitimate site or host malware, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware infections, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker provides a crafted URL to the victim that includes a malicious redirect URL as the `state` parameter value.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with an arbitrary redirect and trick the victim into clicking it."
