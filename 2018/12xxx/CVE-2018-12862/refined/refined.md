Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-12862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is triggered by an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present within Adobe Acrobat and Reader, specifically in the processing of PDF files. A specially crafted PDF document could trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to a vulnerable user. This could be done through various means, such as email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised file sharing systems. The user needs to open the malicious document with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Additional details from the Checkpoint research:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using a fuzzer (WinAFL) on the JP2KLib.dll, which is a parser for the JPEG2000 format.
*   The research involved reversing JP2KLib to understand the necessary calls to trigger the parsing functionality. A harness was created to call the library.
*   The researchers also found many other vulnerabilities using the described fuzzing technique in different parsers of Adobe Reader.
*   The research resulted in 53 total vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro
*   The specific version of JP2KLib.dll identified in the research was version 1.2.2.39492.
