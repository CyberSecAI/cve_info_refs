Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-12336:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Root Login in Ecos SBS

**Root Cause:** The Ecos Secure Boot Stick (SBS) contains a global configuration with an encrypted `shadow` file that has a root user with a set password. This `shadow` file is present even on sticks directly from the vendor that have not been enrolled, suggesting a potential undocumented root login to the sticks themselves.

**Weakness:**  The presence of a pre-configured root account with a known (or easily cracked) password. The base64 encoded signature in the `shadow` file points to Ecos, indicating that the password isn't randomly generated per device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Backdoor Access:** Vendor has the possibility to use the root account as a backdoor and log into SBS when it is active.
*   **Data Access:** The vendor may access files on the private hard drive of the PC, download private configurations (e.g., private keys and passwords).
*   **Configuration Modification:** The vendor (or attacker) may modify existing configurations (e.g., switch to an insecure encryption scheme).
*   **Compromise Risk:** If the vendor experiences a security breach, other parties might exploit this backdoor.
*   **Brute-Force Risk:**  If the same password is used for all customers, an attacker might brute-force the root account and use the backdoor in other installations.
*   **Credential Theft:** If the password is ever used, a fake SSH service might record it and make it available to third parties.

**Attack Vector:** Remote SSH access to the Ecos SBS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Network connectivity to the SBS device.
*   Knowledge of the root password (either through cracking or vendor compromise).

**Mitigation Measures:**

*   Do not use the SBS in scenarios where remote SSH access is possible (e.g., the open Internet) without an external firewall that suppresses incoming SSH connections.

**Additional Details:** The report references `basedata/certs` on the fourth partition of the SBS as the location of the global configuration, which includes the encrypted `shadow` file. The report also indicates that this vulnerability was verified over SSH.
