Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `add_sidebar.php` file within the admin panel of Elite CMS Pro version 2.01. This vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `page` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `page` parameter in `add_sidebar.php` is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, by injecting SQL queries that bypass authentication or directly access tables.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, successful exploitation could potentially lead to privilege escalation depending on database configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `add_sidebar.php` file, specifically by manipulating the `page` parameter.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker injects SQL code directly within the URL parameter, which is then passed to the vulnerable server-side code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to know the admin credentials to access the vulnerable `add_sidebar.php` file in the admin panel.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious query.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a union-based SQL injection attack to extract user credentials.
