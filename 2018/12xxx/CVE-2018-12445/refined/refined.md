```
{
  "Root cause": "The FingerprintManager class for Biometric validation allows authentication bypass through the callback method from onAuthenticationFailed to onAuthenticationSucceeded with null, because the fingerprint API in conjunction with the Android keyGenerator class is not implemented.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper Platform Usage",
    "Improper Authentication"
  ],
  "Impact": "Authentication Bypass, Information Disclosure",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to a rooted Android device can perform runtime manipulation of the biometric authentication, forcing it to return true. A malicious application can hook into the biometric mechanism to bypass the authentication process.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Access to a rooted Android device, ability to perform runtime manipulation or create a malicious app."
