Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-12113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Core FTP LE client software. This vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the server's response to the PASV command. Specifically, a long string is passed as an argument in the passive mode response, which overflows a buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the client software when handling the PASV command response. The client attempts to copy data from the server's PASV response into a fixed-size buffer without proper validation of the size of the incoming data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a denial of service by crashing the vulnerable FTP client application.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution, where the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, though the provided information mainly showcases a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** The attack vector involves an attacker hosting a malicious FTP server.
*   **PASV Response Manipulation:**  The attacker crafts a response to the PASV command that contains a string longer than expected by the client, triggering the buffer overflow during the processing of that response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host FTP Server:** The attacker needs the capability to host a malicious FTP server and be able to get the targeted client to connect to it.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to communicate with the victim's FTP client.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically found in Core FTP LE version 2.2 Build 1921.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates the vulnerability by creating a malicious FTP server that sends a large amount of data within the PASV response, triggering a crash in the client.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the server's response to the clientâ€™s PASV command.

In summary, this is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability triggered remotely through a manipulated PASV command response on a malicious FTP server, which could result in denial of service or potentially, remote code execution.
