{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation and sanitization on user supplied file names.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can hijack a user's session by injecting malicious JavaScript that executes when a victim views a file with a crafted name through the File Browser functionality in a web browser. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization of file names.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a file with a specially crafted name containing an HTML element with a malicious JavaScript attribute. The victim then accesses the file via the File Browser, triggering the malicious script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs write access to a share on the Seagate device to upload a file with a malicious name. They also need to induce the victim to view the file via the web browser interface of the device."
