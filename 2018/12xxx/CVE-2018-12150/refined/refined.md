The provided content is related to CVE-2018-12150.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the installer of Intel(r) Extreme Tuning Utility.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls in the installer, allowing a local user to perform actions that should be restricted to administrator privileges. The specific flaw is described as an "escalation of privilege".

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated local user could exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute code or disclose sensitive information with administrator privileges. This represents a significant security risk, allowing a lower-privileged user to gain complete control over a system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local access, meaning an attacker must already have some level of access to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the vulnerable machine. The user interaction is a required component of the exploit.
