The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14008.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted 802.1x authentication packet sent from a data port can cause the Dot1x agent to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The 802.1x authentication mechanism in Arista EOS is vulnerable to a denial of service attack.
- The vulnerability extends to MACsec when dynamic keys are used ("key source dot1x" configured in the macsec profile).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service by crashing the Dot1x agent.
- Prevents successful authentication of other users on the data plane.
- MACsec connections using dynamic keys might also fail.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted 802.1x authentication packet sent from a data port.
- Adjacent network position is sufficient for an attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send crafted 802.1x packets.
- Network connectivity to the affected device's data port is required.
- No authentication is needed.
