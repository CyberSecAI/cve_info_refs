Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-14432:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `/v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects` API endpoint in OpenStack Keystone, intended for federated users, was incorrectly implemented. Instead of returning only projects a user has access to, it returned all projects within the deployment. This endpoint was later deprecated in favor of `/v3/auth/projects`, but the flawed implementation remained.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure/Data Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of project information to unauthorized users.  The API returned a list of all projects and their attributes, which should have been restricted based on the user's assigned roles.
*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The API lacked proper authorization checks, failing to filter projects based on the user's access rights.
*   **Code Duplication:** The `/v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects` endpoint had a separate code path from the `/v3/auth/projects` endpoint, leading to inconsistent behavior and this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An authenticated user (including regular and federated users in some cases) could discover the existence and attributes of projects they have no authorization to access.
*   **Potential Reconnaissance:** The leaked information could be used for reconnaissance by attackers attempting to identify potential targets for further attacks.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Although project information is not considered highly sensitive in all scenarios, leaking the project structure and all attributes could be seen as a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Keystone API.
*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a `GET` request to the `/v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects` endpoint.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid token to access the API, but the token can be a regular unscoped token, a project-scoped token, or a federated token (depending on the version).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must have a valid user account and be able to authenticate to the Keystone API to obtain an appropriate token.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the Keystone API endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and function of the vulnerable `/v3/OS-FEDERATION/projects` API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in OpenStack Keystone versions prior to the fixes. It existed in different releases depending on whether a federated token was used or a regular token.
*   The fix involved redirecting the request from the vulnerable endpoint to the correct one (`/v3/auth/projects`) to avoid code duplication and ensure the correct authorization is implemented. The fix also removed the vulnerable code.
*   A workaround prior to the fix was disabling the vulnerable API through policy.json configurations to force users to use the `/v3/auth/projects` endpoint, which is not affected.
*   The issue was found to be more broad as initially thought. Early analysis suggested that it affected only Federated tokens. Later analysis found it affects non federated tokens as well.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory indicates that it was fixed in the following versions: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton), Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike) and Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

In summary, CVE-2018-14432 is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by a flawed API endpoint in OpenStack Keystone that allowed unauthorized users to discover all projects within the deployment. The fix involved removing the vulnerable endpoint and redirecting requests to the correct one, ensuring users only access project information they are authorized to view.
