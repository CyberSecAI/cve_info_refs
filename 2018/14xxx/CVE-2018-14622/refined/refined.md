{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-14622",
  "description": "A flaw was found in libtirpc. The return value of makefd_xprt was used without checking for NULL in svc_vc.c, leading to a null pointer dereference / segfault if the maximum number of available file descriptors was exhausted.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `makefd_xprt` function's return value was not checked for NULL before being used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null Pointer Dereference",
      "Missing check for NULL return value"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause an rpc-based application to crash by flooding it with new connections, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network connections flooding",
	  "Sending crafted inputs"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections with an RPC based application. They need to be able to generate a sufficient number of connections to exhaust file descriptors.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability occurs in `svc_vc.c`. The lack of a NULL check on the return value of `makefd_xprt` results in a null pointer dereference when the system runs out of file descriptors."
