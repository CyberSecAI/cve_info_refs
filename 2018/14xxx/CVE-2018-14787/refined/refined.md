Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **CVE-2018-14787:** Improper privilege management in Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) and Xcelera software. The vulnerability stems from weak permissions on folders containing executables, allowing authenticated users to write to these folders.
*   **CVE-2018-14789**: Unquoted search path or element in Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) and Xcelera software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CVE-2018-14787:**
    *   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):**  Authenticated users have write permissions to folders containing executables, which allows them to place malicious code in those folders.
*   **CVE-2018-14789:**
    *   **Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428):** The system does not properly handle paths containing spaces, potentially allowing for malicious code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2018-14787:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a user to a local administrator.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the ISCV/Xcelera server.
*   **CVE-2018-14789:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their level of privileges.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the ISCV/Xcelera server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Both vulnerabilities require local access to the ISCV/Xcelera server.
*   **User privileges:** For CVE-2018-14787, the attacker requires user privileges to the ISCV/Xcelera server, but those can be low-level privileges. For CVE-2018-14789, the attacker requires higher-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability
*   **Malicious File Upload/Placement:** The attacker needs to place a malicious executable within the vulnerable path or folder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical or remote access** to the server.
*   **User account** on the server with specific privileges to write to certain directories. For CVE-2018-14789 the attacker requires higher privileges than just user level.
*   Ability to **place or upload** malicious files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities were reported to NCCIC by Philips.
*   Philips has released or is scheduled to release updates to address these vulnerabilities.
*   Interim mitigation steps are suggested, including reviewing and restricting file permissions.
*   The vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
*   There were no known public exploits targeting these vulnerabilities at the time of the advisory.
*   CVSS v3 base score for CVE-2018-14787 is 7.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H).
