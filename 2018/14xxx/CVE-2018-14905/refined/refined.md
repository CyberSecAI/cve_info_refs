The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the 3cx web service, and specifically mentions CVE-2018-14905 as being related to the article.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The application exposes stack trace errors which reveals server information.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `TimeZoneName` parameter in the `/api/CallLog` endpoint is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting on Stack Trace:**  The `propertyPath` parameter in the URL `https://<ip>:5001/#/app/ivr_editor/4` is vulnerable to XSS.

**Root Cause:**
*   **Improper error handling** allows stack traces to be exposed.
*   **Lack of input sanitization** in the `TimeZoneName` and `propertyPath` parameters leads to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Stack traces reveal server information, which could aid further attacks.
*   **Cross-site scripting:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with a specific payload in the `TimeZoneName` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript when a victim clicks the link.
*   **Cross-site scripting in stack trace:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code through the `propertyPath` parameter which gets executed when the application renders the stack trace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
*   For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to convince the victim to click the malicious link.
*   For the XSS in the stack trace, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `propertyPath` parameter.
