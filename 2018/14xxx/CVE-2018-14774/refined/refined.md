Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `HttpCache` component in Symfony was implicitly trusting `X-Forwarded-Host` headers when handling sub-requests. This means that if a malicious client sent a crafted `X-Forwarded-Host` header, the application would use that value without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for Host header injection. By controlling the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, an attacker could potentially influence the hostname used by the application, leading to various attacks like password reset poisoning, and other attacks related to the applicationâ€™s domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is the ability to perform Host header injection attacks. This could potentially lead to:
    - **Password Reset Poisoning:** An attacker could craft a link in a password reset email that points to a malicious server under their control.
    - **Other attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that could occur by being able to control the hostname used by the application, such as session hijacking, or redirecting to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-Forwarded-Host` header.
- **Sub-requests:** The vulnerability occurs when `HttpCache` processes sub-requests. If an attacker can initiate such a sub-request to a vulnerable application, the header can be injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, including custom headers.
- **Not a Trusted Proxy:** The attacker must not be a trusted proxy, as the fix specifically targets untrusted clients.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present when using `HttpCache` component of the Symfony framework
- The fix removes trusted headers when doing internal sub-requests and the remote client is not trusted.
- Affected versions: Symfony 2.7.0 to 2.7.48, 2.8.0 to 2.8.43, 3.3.0 to 3.3.17, 3.4.0 to 3.4.13, 4.0.0 to 4.0.13, and 4.1.0 to 4.1.2.
