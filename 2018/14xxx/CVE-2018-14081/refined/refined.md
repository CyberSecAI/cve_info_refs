Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the storage of credentials in plain text within the D-Link DIR-809 router. This means sensitive information, such as the WPA key, is not encrypted and is easily accessible if the device is compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-256: Unprotected Storage of Credentials:** The router does not properly protect the storage of sensitive credentials.
*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:**  Credentials, specifically the WPA key, are stored in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Control:** An attacker can gain complete remote control of the affected router with administrator privileges.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker can access and exfiltrate all the device's configuration and stored information, including the WPA key.
*   **Full System Control:**  Once they have administrator access, they can perform any action on the router, such as changing configurations, intercepting traffic, and potentially using the compromised router as a node in a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, provided the attacker has network access to the device.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** CVE-2018-14081 is exploitable by leveraging another vulnerability (**CVE-2018-14080**) that allows bypassing security and authentication to download the device's configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target router (potentially through the internet if the router's management interface is exposed or via a compromised local network).
*   **Technical Skill:** The attacker requires the technical skill to exploit CVE-2018-14080 in order to access the router config file that contains the credentials, and chain the exploitation with CVE-2018-14081 to leverage the stored credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Model:** The D-Link DIR-809 router is specifically mentioned as being affected.
*   **Firmware Versions:** The exploit has been successfully tested on the following firmware versions:
    *   A1 <= 1.09 (latest version)
    *   A2 <= 1.11 (latest version)
    *   GuestZone (Brazil) <= 1.09 (latest version)
*   **Widespread Vulnerability:** Over 7,000 of these devices were found connected to the internet and vulnerable. The primary geographical location of vulnerable devices is in Latin America.
*   **Lack of Patch:** The manufacturer has not released any update to fix this vulnerability.
