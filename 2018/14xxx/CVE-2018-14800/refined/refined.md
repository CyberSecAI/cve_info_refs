- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate the size of a crafted file, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow when opened. This allows overwriting of stack memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** By opening a specially crafted file, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file to the user and convince the user to open it with the vulnerable software. Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
