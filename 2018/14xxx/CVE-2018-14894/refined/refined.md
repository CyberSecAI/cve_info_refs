Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) handles file access and blacklisting. Specifically, EPM fails to properly inspect files if the "SYSTEM" account is denied read access to the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Application Blacklisting:** CyberArk EPM has a feature to block specified applications. However, by revoking the "SYSTEM" account's read privileges on a blocked file, the EPM software is unable to access the file's information, effectively making it "blind" to the block. This allows the blacklisted application to execute.
- **Insufficient File Access Control Checks:** The core issue is that the application does not implement sufficient checks to ensure that it can read the file metadata before enforcing its blacklist rules. It relies on the SYSTEM account having read access, which can be easily manipulated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of Blocked Applications:** An attacker can execute blacklisted applications, bypassing the intended security controls of CyberArk EPM. This could lead to the execution of malicious programs or the circumvention of security policies.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a direct privilege escalation, it can lead to the ability to run code that would otherwise be blocked, potentially giving the attacker more control and the ability to carry out other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System Manipulation:** An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the access control list (ACL) of a file on the local file system, specifically revoking "SYSTEM" read access, in order to bypass the CyberArk EPM controls on that file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the target machine.
- They must have the ability to modify file permissions (ACLs).  While the content states "even with slave privileges,"  the level of privilege needed to modify ACLs may vary depending on the system's configuration.
- The attacker must know which file(s) are blocked by CyberArk EPM and have access to them.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit code provided uses .NET to change file access permissions, specifically denying the "SYSTEM" user read access to a file.
- The vulnerability was found and tested on CyberArk EPM version 10.2.1.603 and below on Windows 10 x64.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the application blacklisting feature by manipulating file permissions so that the security software cannot access the file's metadata before it executes.
