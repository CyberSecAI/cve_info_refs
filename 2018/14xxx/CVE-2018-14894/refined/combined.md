#### [Reduce Your Attack Surface](#remove)

#### Reduce your attack surface by removing local admin rights

Endpoint Privilege Manager helps remove local admin rights while improving user experience and optimizing IT operations.

Flexible policy-based management simplifies privilege orchestration and allows controlled Just-In-Time maintenance sessions.

#### [Enforce Least Privilege](#enforce)

#### Enforce Least Privilege

Comprehensive conditional policy-based application control helps you create scenarios for every user group, from HR to DevOps. Application context, parameters and attributes are considered to allow or block certain script, application or operation.

[Endpoint Privilege Needs Management and Security](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/white-papers/endpoint-privilege-needs-management-and-security-here-s-how-to-attain-both)

![CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager Helps Enforce least privilege](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/enforce-least-privilege-tour.png)

#### [Defend Against Ransomware](#ransomware)

#### Defend Against Ransomware

Ransomware can be tricky so we continuously test Endpoint Privilege Manager against new strains of ransomware.

#### [Boost Visibility with Policy Audit](#audit)

#### Boost Visibility with Policy Audit

Endpoint Privilege Manager’s Policy Audit capabilities enable you to create audit trails to track and analyze privilege elevation attempts. The rich reporting engine helps you maintain visibility and control over your endpoints.

![CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager Boosts Visibility with Policy Audit](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/boost-visability-tour.png)

#### [Stop Credential Theft](#theft)

#### Stop Credential Theft

Credential theft enables attacker to move laterally and is a major part of every breach.

Endpoint Privilege Manager defends credentials and credential stores and helps detect attacks early with credential lures placed in attackers’ pathways.

[Read the Report](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/analyst-reports/2024-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-privileged-access-management)
### Foundational endpoint security

Endpoint-originating attacks can be devastating, ranging from disruption to extortion. But increased investment in traditional endpoint security has failed to reduce the number of successful attacks.

Endpoint Privilege Manager, a critical and foundational endpoint control addresses the underlying weaknesses of endpoint defenses against a privileged attacker and helps enterprises defend against these attacks.

# CyberArk EPM file block bypass - CVE-2018-14894

 Wednesday. November 07, 2018 -  1 min

Hi folks! I found an interesting vulnerability on **[CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager](https://www.cyberark.com/products/privileged-account-security-solution/endpoint-privilege-manager/)**. **CyberArk EPM** file block bypass (**CVE-2018-14894**) is very easy -even you have slave privileges-.**CyberArk EPM** aims to manage privileges from one hand and prevent any harm with admin privileges.

## How does CyberArk EPM work?

If user needs admin privileges, **CyberArk** gives the **admin** **token** to user for spesific process not for the whole system. It is cool idea.

This product also has a function called “Application Blacklist”. You probably know what that means.

It helps you to block to execute specified application by CyberArk admin. In normal cases, you can not be able to start this process even with admin rights.

But I found **very interesting trick to makes CyberArk blind completely!**All you need to do, revoke read privileges for system on the file that you want to open it.

After you do that, **CyberArk EPM** can not be able to get information about your blocked file and it just let them execute!

This exploit works on **CyberArk EPM 10.2.1.603** and below. (Tested on Windows 10 x64)

# Exploit Title: CyberArk Endpoint bypass
# Google Dork: -
# Date: 03/06/2018
# Exploit Author: Alpcan Onaran, Mustafa Kemal Can

# Version: 10.2.1.603
# Tested on: Windows 10
# CVE : CVE-2018-14894

//If user needs admin privileges, CyberArk gives the admin token to user for spesific process not for the whole system. It is cool idea.
//This product also has a function called “Application Blacklist”. You probably know what that means.
//It helps you to block to execute specified application by CyberArk admin. In normal cases, you can not be able to start this process even with admin rights.
//But We found very interesting trick to make CyberArk blind completely.All you need to do, revoke read privileges for system on the file that you want to open it.
//After you do that, CyberArk EPM can not be able to get information about your blocked file and it just let them execute

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Exploit Title: CyberArk Endpoint bypass
# Google Dork: -
# Date: 03/06/2018
# Exploit Author: Alpcan Onaran, Mustafa Kemal Can
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.cyberark.com
# Software Link: -
# Version: 10.2.1.603
# Tested on: Windows 10
# CVE : CVE-2018-14894

//If user needs admin privileges, CyberArk gives the admin token to user for spesific process not for the whole system. It is cool idea.
//This product also has a function called “Application Blacklist”. You probably know what that means.
//It helps you to block to execute specified application by CyberArk admin. In normal cases, you can not be able to start this process even with admin rights.
//But We found very interesting trick to make CyberArk blind completely.All you need to do, revoke read privileges for system on the file that you want to open it.
//After you do that, CyberArk EPM can not be able to get information about your blocked file and it just let them execute

This exploit works on CyberArk EPM 10.2.1.603 and below. (Tested on Windows 10 x64)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Fronter XSS - 3 XSS in 1 Blogpost

 Friday. April 06, 2018 -  1 min

Today I want to write about Fronter and Fronter XSS Vulnerabilies. Fronter is a learning platform from leading ICT provider, itslearning. Based on Nordic educational models, Fronter is a comprehensive teaching and learning solution used in schools and universities worldwide. As part of the itslearning portfolio, the Fronter solution has a full range of available support and professional services.

I found lots of XSS vulnerabilities on Itslearning as you know, Fronter was the goal after Itslearning.

## Here is the story of 3 Fronter XSS Vulnerabilities

[![fronter XSS](images/payload-3.jpg)](https://mustafakemalcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/payload-3.jpg)

Our first payload is very typcial one; javascript:alert(1)

Second payload is powered by EMBED; <EMBED SRC=”[https://mustafakemalcan.com/](https://t.co/pO3Wu3kLxh "https://mustafakemalcan.com/webcam.html") ” width= 100% height= 100%></EMBED>

Last payload is more complicated than the other ones ;

I can add keylogger and make webcam request like before that [stored XSS Itslearning vulnerability](https://mustafakemalcan.com/itslearning-xss-part-2/).

UPDATE :

02/04/2018 - I contacted to Fronter Team.

12/04/2018 - Fronter closed vulnerabilities.

07/05/2018 - Fronter decided to give 1200$ bounty to me.
