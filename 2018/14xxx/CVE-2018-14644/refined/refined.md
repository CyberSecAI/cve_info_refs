Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A crafted DNS query for a meta-type (like OPT) can cause the PowerDNS Recursor to incorrectly cache a zone as failing DNSSEC validation.
*   This occurs when the parent zone is DNSSEC signed, and all authoritative servers for that parent zone respond with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect DNSSEC validation:** The recursor improperly handles FORMERR responses for meta-type queries in signed parent zones, leading to incorrect caching.
*   **Caching Failure:** The vulnerability results in a zone being cached as failing DNSSEC validation when it should not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Subsequent DNS queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation for the affected zone will be answered with SERVFAIL, effectively denying access to that zone.
*   The vulnerability causes a denial of service for clients that require DNSSEC validation, as the zone will be deemed invalid.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker sends a crafted DNS query.
*   **Targeted Meta-Type Query:** The attacker must craft a specific DNS query targeting a meta-type like OPT.
*   **Specific DNS configuration:** The vulnerability only arises when a parent zone is signed and all authoritative servers return FORMERR to at least one meta-type query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send DNS queries to a vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor instance.
*   **Knowledge of DNS:** The attacker needs knowledge of DNS and how to craft DNS queries for meta-types.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4.

**Fixed Versions:**

*   PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.0.9 and 4.1.5 are not affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to DNSSEC validation and the way PowerDNS Recursor handles FORMERR responses for meta-type queries.
*   The issue can lead to a denial of service that may affect multiple clients/resolvers using the same PowerDNS Recursor.
