| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1648378#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-09 15:08:17 UTC  ``` An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.   References: <https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-07.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1648378#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-09 15:08:55 UTC  ``` Created pdns tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1648382](show_bug.cgi?id=1648382 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14644 pdns: crafted query for meta-types can lead to a DoS [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1648380](show_bug.cgi?id=1648380 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14644 pdns: crafted query for meta-types can lead to a DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1648378#c2)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-11-12 18:49:50 UTC  ``` Created pdns-recursor tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1649046](show_bug.cgi?id=1649046 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14644 pdns-recursor: pdns: crafted query for meta-types can lead to a DoS [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1649045](show_bug.cgi?id=1649045 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14644 pdns-recursor: pdns: crafted query for meta-types can lead to a DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1648378#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:42:23 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

# PowerDNS Security Advisory 2018-07: Crafted query for meta-types can cause a denial of service[Â¶](#powerdns-security-advisory-2018-07-crafted-query-for-meta-types-can-cause-a-denial-of-service "Permalink to this headline")

* CVE: CVE-2018-14644
* Date: November 6th 2018
* Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4
* Not affected: 4.0.9, 4.1.5
* Severity: Medium
* Impact: Denial of service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted queries for some domains
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where a remote attacker sending
a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached
as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed,
and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to
a query for at least one of the meta-types.
As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation
will be answered with a ServFail.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-14644 by Red Hat.

PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4 is affected.

We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for finding and subsequently
reporting this issue.
