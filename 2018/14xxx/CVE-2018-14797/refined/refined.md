Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-14797:

**Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)

*   **Root Cause:** The system loads DLL files based on a search path. A specially crafted DLL file placed within this search path can be loaded as a legitimate DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of DLL files loaded from the search path.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, which could allow an attacker to perform malicious actions on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker places a malicious DLL file in a location where the affected application searches for DLLs and that the affected process can reach.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to place the malicious DLL file in a location where the application searches for DLLs. The attacker would need local access to the system and the ability to write to the file system at a location where the affected application will search for DLL files. A low privileged user is sufficient for this vulnerability, and user interaction is required.

The provided content also details other vulnerabilities:

*   **CVE-2018-14795:** Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23). Allows replacing executable files due to improper path validation.
*   **CVE-2018-14791:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Non-administrative users can change executable and library files.
*   **CVE-2018-14793:** Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121). Exploitable via an open communication port, leading to arbitrary code execution.

The document also specifies the affected products as:

*   DeltaV versions: v11.3.1, v12.3.1, v13.3.0, v13.3.1, R5

The document also provides mitigations which include:

*   Applying the patch provided by Emerson.
*   Implementing application whitelisting
*   Configuring DeltaV systems according to the DeltaV Security Manual
*   Minimizing network exposure, isolating control systems behind firewalls, and using VPNs for secure remote access.

The document states that the vulnerabilities were discovered by Younes Dragoni and Alessandro Di Pinto of Nozomi Networks, Pavel Cheremushkin and Roland Sako of Kaspersky Lab, Ori Perez of CyberX, and Emerson.
