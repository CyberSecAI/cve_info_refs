Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2018-14948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an allocation-deallocation mismatch in the `WavFile::openWavFile` function. Specifically, memory is allocated using `operator new[]` but deallocated using `operator delete`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Allocation-Deallocation Mismatch:** The core issue is the use of `operator new[]` for allocation and `operator delete` for deallocation, which leads to undefined behavior and memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The alloc-dealloc mismatch corrupts the heap, potentially leading to application crashes or, in more sophisticated cases, arbitrary code execution.
- **Application Termination:** AddressSanitizer (ASAN) detects the mismatch and aborts the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WAV File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted WAV file, specifically, the "alloc_dealloc_mismatch_openWavFile" file, which causes the program to allocate and deallocate memory in an inconsistent manner.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious WAV file to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue occurs in the `WavFile::openWavFile` function located in `src/wav-file.cc`.
- The `allocate_failure_openWavFile` is also mentioned to cause an allocation failure, but is distinct from the alloc-dealloc mismatch.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was detected using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) with gcc 5.4.
- The provided ASAN output clearly identifies the location of the memory allocation and deallocation mismatch.
