# Allocate Failure in function openWavFile

I used **gcc 5.4 and AddressSanitizer** to build **[sound](https://github.com/dilawar/sound/commit/357c2c57e2127dbd996b7e7dce90148f08cf7cbf)**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/sound/allocate_failure_openWavFile) can cause allocate failure when executing this command:

```
./parseSpeech -f allocate_failure_openWavFile

## Description

[![@fouzhe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17958943?u=4abe79664e020f3240e34a74f489801b906fbb55&v=4&size=48)](/fouzhe)[fouzhe](https://github.com/fouzhe)opened [on Jul 24, 2018](https://github.com/dilawar/sound/issues/4#issue-343979544)

I used **gcc 5.4 and AddressSanitizer** to build **[sound](https://github.com/dilawar/sound/commit/357c2c57e2127dbd996b7e7dce90148f08cf7cbf)**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/sound/alloc_dealloc_mismatch_openWavFile) can cause alloc-dealloc-mismatch when executing this command:

```
./parseSpeech -f alloc_dealloc_mismatch_openWavFile
```

This is the ASAN information:

```
