# .NET Reflector 10.0 release notes

Page last updated 04 October 2018

Published 12 February 2018

# Version 10.0.16.1062 - 4th October, 2018

## Fixes

* `RP-4110:` Copying code now respects formatting options (indentation, number format, digit separators).
* `RP-3952:` Copying code now respects selected optimization level (language version).

# Version 10.0.15.1017 - 24th September, 2018

## Enhancements

* When appropriate, class name will be skipped when accessing a static method.

## Fixes

* `RP-4128:` Accessing default properties in Visual Basic is now optimized as indexer calls.
* `RP-4129:` Indexers in C# are no longer treated as regular properties with arguments.

## Fixes (new engine)

* `RP-4123:` Calls to ReferenceEquals are no longer decompiled as equality operators. Operators `==` and `!=` will now only be showed when comparing value types or when comparing reference types with overriden equality operators.
* `RP-4130:` "Unresolved stack state" error was fixed.

# Version 10.0.14.983 - 13th September, 2018

## Fixes

* `RP-4119:` Improvements for `decimal` type.
* `RP-4121:` Properties with arguments (Visual Basic’s feature) are now correctly decompiled in C#. Such properties will now be decompiled as separate `get_` and `set_` methods, because C# doesn’t support those kind of properties.
* `RP-4122:` Some VB 14 features (such as string interpolation) are no longer used when “None” optimization level is selected.

# Version 10.0.13.950 - 6th September, 2018

## Fixes (new engine)

* Decompilation of ternary conditional operators was improved.

# Version 10.0.12.934 - 30th August, 2018

## Fixes (new engine)

* Members defined in base classses are now using proper accessors (`base.Member` instead of `this.Member`).
* Indexers for generic types are now properly accessed.
* Decompilation of setters and getters for indexers and properties is now more accurate. Regular properties should no longer be mistaken for indexers.

# Version 10.0.11.910 - 23rd August, 2018

## Enhancements

* `RP-4108:` Added an option to disable/enable C# 7.0’s **digit separators**.
* It’s now possible to display numbers as **binary literals** (C# 7.0).

## Fixes

* `RP-4112:` Tooltip for numeric literals now shows a correct value.

## Fixes (new engine)

* `RP-3454:` Properties with arguments (Visual Basic) are now correctly decompiled as properties, not methods.
* Multidimensional array initializers are now properly decompiled.
* Decompilation of `try-catch-finally` was improved.
* Other small fixes and improvements to decompilation engine.

# Version 10.0.10.881 - 16th August, 2018

## Enhancements

* `RP-4109:` When decompiling code with missing dependencies it’s now possible to **Skip all** of them, instead of skipping one-by-one.

## Fixes (new engine)

* Decimal `0` will now show as `0`, not `new decimal()`.
* The exception `Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object` should now be fixed.
* Arrays of integers are now decompiled correctly (without duplicated entries).
* Other small fixes and improvements to decompilation engine.

# Version 10.0.9.857 - 9th August, 2018

## Fixes (new engine)

* Lambda expressions are now properly decompiled.
* Decimal numbers are now represented using their short form.
* Filters in `Catch ... When` are now decompiled even if `When` contains statements instead of expressions (we attempt to create a valid code when reflecting the meaning of IL code to C# and Visual Basic).
* Other small fixes and improvements to decompilation engine.

#

# Version 10.0.8.814 - 2nd August, 2018

## Features

With this release we introduced a preview of our new decompilation engine. To use the new version, check the "Preview of a new engine" checkbox on a toolbar.

New engine should generate more accurate code and be more stable. If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to use the feedback link inside the application. We'd love to hear your thoughts!

## Fixes

* `RP-4092:` Many decompilation errors have been eliminated.
* `RP-4100:` Null-conditional operators are now properly decompiled.
* `RP-4113:` Generic-typed variables are no longer compared to `null` using greater-then or less-then operators.

# Version 10.0.7.774 - 24th July, 2018

This release fixes a critical issue where it was possible to execute code by decompiling a .NET object with an embedded resource file. (CVE-2018-14581)

Thanks to Soroush Dalili from NCC Group for bringing this to our attention.

* Minor improvements to .NET Reflector and Visual Studio Add-in

# Version 10.0.6.546 - 25th May, 2018

* Telemetry has been updated in accordance with the privacy policy available at <https://www.red-gate.com/website/legal>.

# SmartAssembly 6.12 release notes

Page last updated 01 March 2019

Published 17 January 2018

# October 12th, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly (**6.12.7**):

### Fixes

* `SA-2100:` Running SmartAssembly as MSBuild task no longer fails.
  + If you encountered this issue, you might need to kill all instances of `MSBuild.exe` process after installing this release, for the fix to take effect.

# October 1st, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly (**6.12.6**):

### Fixes

* `SA-1967:` In applications built with default error reporting template "Dialog box + email address collection" behaviour of the "Save As" button was improved.

# July 24th, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly (**6.12.5**):

This release fixes a critical issue where it was possible to execute code by selecting a source assembly containing a .NET object with an embedded resource file. (CVE-2018-14581)

Thanks to Soroush Dalili from NCC Group for bringing this to our attention.

# July 3rd, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly (**6.12.4**):

The "**I want to reduce unused allocated memory**" option was removed.

### Fixes

* SA-1747 — Tamper Protection now works for embedded assemblies.

# March 8th, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly  (**6.12.3**):

### Fixes

* SA-2046 — Improving error reporting feature for situations when stack is not empty after stepping-in try region.
* SA-2054 — Changed TypeDefinition comparing to match com-imported types.

# February 22nd, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly  (**6.12.2**):

### Fixes

* SmartAssembly informations changed to be more user-friendly.

# January 19th, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly  (**6.12.1**):

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue introduced in the new release on *Options* screen.

# January 17th, 2018

This is a minor release of SmartAssembly which includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

### Features

* SA-1569 — You can now **force** the obfuscation of members that would normally be excluded by safety mechanisms.

In some circumstances, SmartAssembly would automatically exclude some members from obfuscation, if it predicted it could break the final assembly. With this update, you can (at your own risk) skip all SmartAssembly's safety-checks using *[ForceObfuscate]* attribute for definitions of: **methods**, **classes**, **structs**, **properties** and **fields**. By default, marked members will be renamed in accordance with the chosen Name Mangling setting, although you can use *[ForceObfuscate(true)]* to rename them in a more predictable way, if need be.

### Fixes

* SA-1734 — SmartAssembly failed to process Portable Class Libraries targeting .NET 4.5+.
