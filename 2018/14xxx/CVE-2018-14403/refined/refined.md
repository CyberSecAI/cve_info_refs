{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from inconsistent type checking between atom creation and atom lookup within the libmp4v2 library. When creating an atom, the library strictly checks the 4-byte type read from a file to determine the appropriate atom constructor. However, when looking up an atom using the `FindAtom` function, the `MP4NameFirstMatches` function performs a less strict comparison. This function prematurely returns true if the compared string `s1` ends earlier than `s2`, which leads to type confusion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion due to inconsistent string comparison during atom creation and lookup.",
      "Out-of-bounds read caused by incorrect type casting due to the type confusion."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious MP4 file that exploits this type confusion to trigger out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically, an attacker can introduce a crafted atom with type 'sdt\\x00', which is incorrectly identified as 'sdtp' by `FindAtom`. This leads to an incorrect cast and access to memory outside the allocated object resulting in a crash.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted MP4 file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a MP4 file, and then cause the vulnerable application to process this crafted file."
