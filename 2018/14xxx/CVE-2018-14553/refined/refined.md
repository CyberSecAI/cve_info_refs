  "CVE-2018-14553": {
    "description": "gdImageClone in gd.c in libgd 2.1.0-rc2 through 2.2.5 has a NULL pointer dereference allowing attackers to crash an application via a specific function call sequence. Only affects PHP when linked with an external libgd (not bundled).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the `gdImageClone()` function when the image being cloned has a style set. The code attempts to manually copy the style data, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not handled correctly, since it is actually copied later.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, crashing the application using libgd2.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A specific function call sequence to trigger the NULL pointer dereference in gdImageClone()."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by calling the affected function with crafted input."
    },
     "affected_versions": "libgd versions 2.1.0-rc2 through 2.2.5",
     "fix_versions": "Fixed in libgd versions 2.1.0-24.17.1, 2.2.5-4.14.1, 2.2.5-lp151.6.6.1, 2.2.5-9.1, 2.2.5-11.3.1, 2.3.3-1.1 and later versions."
