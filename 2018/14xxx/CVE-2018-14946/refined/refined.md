The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14946.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an alloc-dealloc-mismatch in the `~HtmlString` function within the pdf2json software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code uses `malloc` to allocate memory and then attempts to deallocate it using `operator delete`, resulting in a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The alloc-dealloc mismatch leads to a crash due to memory corruption. The provided ASAN output shows the program aborting due to this error, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2json` application for processing. No specific user privileges or network access is mentioned as a requirement for exploitation, implying that local access to the vulnerable software may be sufficient.
