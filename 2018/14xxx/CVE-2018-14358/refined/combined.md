# Mutt, NeoMutt: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mutt and NeoMutt, the
worst of which allows for arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-client/mutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.10.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.10.1** |

| Package | **mail-client/neomutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20180716** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20180716** |

### Background

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client.

NeoMutt is a command line mail reader (or MUA). It’s a fork of Mutt
with added features.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mutt, and NeoMutt.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted mail
message or connect to malicious mail server using Mutt or NeoMutt,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or directory traversal
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-client/mutt-1.10.1"

```

All NeoMuutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/neomutt-20180716"

```

We're still in feature freeze (mostly) for 1.6. The list of items blocking the
release of mutt 1.6 may be found here:
<http://dev.mutt.org/trac/milestone/1.6>
Patches for any issues found there would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks to all the contributors for this release, especially Rocco for authoring
well over half the changes.

Mutt 1.5.17 was released on November 1, 2007. This is a collection of

<http://dev.mutt.org/trac/milestone/1.6>

[CVE-2007-2683](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2683)
(gecos overflow) and
[CVE-2007-1558](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1558)
(APOP MD5 collision attack).

Mutt 1.5.15 was released on April 6, 2007. This version has several new
and long-standing feature patches applied in anticipation of a feature
freeze toward 1.6. These include built-in SMTP, flowed mail support
improvements, xterm title updating, charset improvements, GPG PKA
support, etc. See the [ChangeLog](https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/raw/stable/ChangeLog) for
full details.

Mutt 1.5.14 was released on February 23, 2007. This version is a snapshot
of the recent development activity. See the ChangeLog for details.

Mutt 1.5.13 was released on August 14, 2006. This version is a snapshot of the
recent development activity. See the ChangeLog for details.

Mutt 1.5.12 was released on July 14, 2006. This version is a snapshot of the
recent development activity and also fixes CVE-2006-3242. See the ChangeLog
for details.

a buffer overflow that could be triggered by a malicious IMAP server.

Mutt 1.5.8 was released on February 12, 2005.

Sept 18th 2004. The mailing lists are slowly coming back to life. Since the
failure of 6 days ago, mail has been stored. Approx figures are 25,000 mutt.org
emails of which 4,600 were viruses (virii) and about 35 actual list traffic.
Much being to invalid addresses and backscatter from forged mutt.org addresses.

However normality has now been restored (HHGTTG).

Mutt 1.4.2.1 was released on February 12, 2004. This release includes some
files which were missing from the 1.4.2 release.

Mutt 1.4.2 was released on February 11, 2004. This version fixes a buffer
overflow that can be triggered by incoming messages. There are reports about
spam that has actually triggered this problem and crashed mutt. It is
recommended that users of mutt versions prior to 1.4.2 upgrade to this
version, or apply the patch included below. Users of "unstable" mutt versions
after 1.3.28 (including 1.5.\*) do not need to upgrade, as this problem had been
fixed in the unstable branch in February 2002; unfortunately, the fix was not
backported before 1.4 was released.

Mutt 1.4.1 and 1.5.4 were released on March 19, 2003. These releases both fix
a **buffer overflow** identified by Core Security Technologies.
The only differences between 1.4 and 1.4.1 are bug fixes. If you are currently
using 1.4, it's probably a very good idea to update.

**Mutt 1.4** was released on May 29, 2002. This release has been
a long time coming, and users of older versions such as 1.2.x are encouraged to
take a look at 1.4 and the [changes](changes.html).

Mutt 1.3.99 was released on May 2, 2002. This is hopefully the last
**release candidate** before 1.4 final.

Mutt 1.3.28 was released on March 13, 2002. This is a **release
candidate** for 1.4.

Mutt 1.3.27 was released on January 22, 2002. This is the next
**beta** release toward the upcoming 1.4. This release fixes the
SSL core dump present in the short-lived 1.3.26.

Mutt 1.3.26 was released on January 18, 2002. This is the next
**beta** release toward the upcoming 1.4.

Mutt 1.2.5.1 and 1.3.25 were released on January 1, 2002. These releases both
fix a **security hole** which can be remotely exploited. For more
information, see the
[release announcement](announce/mutt-1.2.5.1-1.3.25.html).

Mutt 1.3.24 was released on November 30, 2001. This is a **beta**
development release toward the next stable public release version. There have
been several large changes since 1.2.x, so please check the
[recent changes page](changes.html).

The Mutt CVS server has **moved** from ftp.guug.de to ftp.mutt.org.

Mutt 1.2.5 was released on July 28, 2000. This is the latest maintenance
update of the stable branch of mutt, and this time, we really suggest that you
update.

This release fixes at least one grave IMAP error which may lead to confusing
display and other strangeness, and our instances of the "wuftpd format bug",
which had (mostly) the effect that your IMAP server's operator could break into
your computer with some work.

Mutt 1.2.4 was released on July 7, 2000. This version fixes a couple of
problems present in 1.2.2, and one problem leading to crashes whose fix was
lacking from 1.2.3. We suggest that users of earlier versions upgrade to this
release of mutt.

Mutt 1.2.3 was released on July 7, 2000.

Mutt 1.2.2 was released on June 20, 2000. This version fixes a build problem
present with 1.2.1. If Mutt-1.2.1 is working for you, there is no need to
upgrade.

Mutt 1.2.1 was released on June 19, 2000.

**Mutt 1.2** was released on May 9, 2000. Note that
this version contains several significant changes, and users should
**not** upgrade without reading the
[release announcement](announce/mutt-1.2.html) and the
[README.UPGRADE](doc/README.UPGRADE-1.2) file.

Mutt 1.0.1 was released on January 19, 2000. Changes include a y2k fix for
dealing with odd dates from some mailers, and additional translations. There
is no reason to upgrade if you haven't experienced problems with 1.0.

**Mutt 1.0** was released on October 22, 1999. The
[release announcement](announce/mutt-1.0.asc) is
available.

Mutt 1.0pre4 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on October 11, 1999.

Mutt 1.0pre3 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on September 25, 1999. This fixes
the below mentioned buffer overflow, and users are urged to upgrade immediately.

A buffer overflow has been discovered in Mutt's text/enriched handler for both
the stable and unstable branches. It may be exploited by an attacker
constructing suitably formatted e-mail messages. A patch can be found
here, and new releases will be available shortly.

Mutt 1.0pre2 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on September 1, 1999.

Mutt 1.0pre1 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on August 24, 1999.

Mutt 0.95.7 (BETA) was released on August 17, 1999.

Mutt 0.95.6 (BETA) was released on June 3, 1999.

Mutt 0.95.5 (BETA) was released on April 23, 1999.

Mutt 0.95.3 (BETA) was released on February 12, 1999.

Mutt 0.95.1 (BETA) was released on January 4, 1999.

Mutt 0.95 (BETA) was released on December 12, 1998.

A serious security hole has been found in Mutt's handling of MIME content
types. All Mutt users are encouraged to upgrade to at least version 0.93.2
in order to correct the problem. For more information,
[check the CERT site](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-98.10.mime_buffer_overflows.html).

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [mutt](/security/cves?package=mutt) - text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading

## Details

USN-3719-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Mutt. Unfortunately, the fixes were

not correctly applied to the packaging for Mutt in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

This update corrects the oversight.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
