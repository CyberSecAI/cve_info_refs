[Hector Miranda (3).](/profile/profile/details/388549)

Posted on 15 May 2017

I used this to:
I cannot use it!
Owner's reply:
Hello,

Im really sorry that you are dissappointed, but I kindly ask you, please, to use common sense. You wrote your ticket on Friday. You can find statement on support system that work hours are on Monday-Friday, we do not work on weekends. Now it is Monday, actually the very next working day after you ticket submission and you already are mad that your issue has not been solved? You didnt even wrote what is actually your problem in the ticket so far. I replied to your ticket on support system asking for more informations. Please take a look, specify problem and let's solve it! :)

Have a nice day,

Pavel

#### [Simple and fast](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/cw-article-attachments/#rev-103592)

[Fernando (13).](/profile/profile/details/215736)

Posted on 24 February 2017

###### Functionality

###### Ease of use

###### Support

5 stars to Pavel, really concrete in helping.

#### [Decent, but not great](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/cw-article-attachments/#rev-102423)

[Dimitris Dadiotis (1).](/profile/profile/details/383483)

Posted on 07 December 2016

###### Functionality

Works mostly as advertised, although it does have some bugs and hickups that make it less reliable than what one would expect.

###### Ease of use

Pretty intuitive to use, only problem is that it requires several steps to completely add an attachment (three saves for a complete listing)

###### Support

Non-existent, there is a public support ticket system but few tickets seem to get answered by the developers.Support email is inoperative.

###### Documentation

Sufficient and detailed instructions for use are included in the installation package. Minimal other resources.

I used this to:
Professional website of b2b sales.
Owner's reply:
Hello,

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
