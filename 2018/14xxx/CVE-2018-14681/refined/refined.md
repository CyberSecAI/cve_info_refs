Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-14681:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the `kwajd_read_headers` function within `mspack/kwajd.c` in the `libmspack` library. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle KWAJ file header extensions, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:**  The vulnerability allows writing one or two bytes outside the allocated buffer. This occurs when parsing filename and extension headers, where a crafted file can cause the function to read a filename/extension that is not properly null terminated and attempt to copy past the buffer boundary.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although most sources only mention a crash or denial of service, some sources suggest it *could possibly* lead to arbitrary code execution.  The Ubuntu advisory, for instance, mentions "an attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.".
-   **Denial of Service:** By triggering the out-of-bounds write, an attacker can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Malicious KWAJ files:** An attacker crafts a malicious KWAJ file with specific headers that trigger the vulnerability when parsed by `libmspack`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted KWAJ file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of `libmspack` to parse the file.

**Additional Technical Details:**
* The issue is related to the parsing of filename and extension headers within the KWAJ format. The vulnerable code allocates a fixed-size buffer and copies filename/extension data into it, reading up to 9 bytes for the filename and 4 bytes for the extension with a following null termination byte. However, if no null termination byte was encountered, the code could read beyond the intended buffer boundaries.
* The fix implemented involved limiting the amount of bytes copied to buffer size, and explicitly checking if the filename and extension strings are null-terminated. If not null terminated strings are encountered the file is rejected.

**Affected software:**
*   `libmspack` versions prior to 0.7alpha are vulnerable.
*   Specifically, the Debian security advisory mentions versions prior to 0.5-1+deb9u2 (for the stable distribution "stretch"), which means that also versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are also affected.

**Mitigation:**
* Update to `libmspack` version 0.7alpha or later.
* Apply the security patch, specifically commit `0b0ef9344255ff5acfac6b7af09198ac9c9756c8`

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-14681 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in `libmspack` that can be triggered by a malformed KWAJ file. This can lead to application crashes (denial of service) and potentially arbitrary code execution.
