## Description

[![@fCorleone](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22519865?u=051868d1e1a8a939ede5a1c6818dd528ce636a3c&v=4&size=48)](/fCorleone)[fCorleone](https://github.com/fCorleone)opened [on Jul 18, 2018](https://github.com/thunlp/THULAC/issues/37#issue-342153886)

When I give an empty file to the program train\_c, I found this issue:

```
=================================================================
