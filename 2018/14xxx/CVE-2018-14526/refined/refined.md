Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-14526:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `wpa_supplicant`'s handling of EAPOL-Key frames. Specifically, under certain conditions, the integrity of these messages is not properly checked before decryption takes place.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Decryption:**  The primary weakness is that `wpa_supplicant` can be tricked into decrypting the "Key Data" field of an EAPOL-Key frame without first verifying the message's authenticity using a Message Integrity Check (MIC).
*   **TKIP Vulnerability:**  This issue is particularly exploitable when the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is used as the pairwise cipher. TKIP uses RC4 for encryption, which makes the plaintext susceptible to bitwise manipulation by an attacker.
*   **Decryption Oracle:** This vulnerability creates a "decryption oracle" where an attacker can manipulate the encrypted "Key Data" and observe the resulting behavior of `wpa_supplicant`. By observing whether the client accepts or rejects manipulated frames the attacker can deduce partial information about the group key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker within range can exploit this to recover sensitive information, particularly the Group Transient Key (GTK) or the Integrity Group Transient Key (IGTK).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can inject modified group keys, causing the station to reject valid group-addressed frames, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Key Recovery:** Full recovery of group encryption keys requires multiple attempts, with each attempt causing a disconnection. This could temporarily disable access points if repeated frequently.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** If the group keys are recovered successfully, the attacker may be able to decrypt traffic or inject malicious traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the target access point and client.
*   **EAPOL-Key Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the EAPOL-Key frames in a way that bypasses the MIC check.
*   **TKIP Required:** Vulnerability only exploitable when using TKIP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Wireless Access:** Must be within range of the targeted wireless network
*   **Packet Manipulation:** Must be capable of intercepting and manipulating EAPOL-Key frames.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** Needs understanding of the WPA2 protocol including EAPOL-key exchange
*   **Target Network:** Must target networks using the TKIP protocol for encryption.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mathy Vanhoef.
*   Patches are available for various affected systems (e.g., Red Hat, Ubuntu, openSUSE, SUSE).
*   Mitigations include:
    *   Disabling TKIP on both client and AP sides, using AES-CCMP instead.
    *   Applying provided patches or upgrading `wpa_supplicant` to version 2.7 or later.
*   This is a moderate security issue, which can have a severe impact depending on the environment.

In summary, CVE-2018-14526 allows a nearby attacker to bypass authentication of certain EAPOL-Key frames when using TKIP, leading to the possibility of information leakage and denial-of-service attacks. The core issue is improper handling of encrypted data before verifying its authenticity.
