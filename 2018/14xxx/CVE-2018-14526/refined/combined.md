| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c0)  flo gleixner   2018-09-20 21:51:25 UTC  ``` While trying to set up a connection with Eduroam (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduroam>), i tried to use the nowadays preferred EAP method PWD. The NetworkManager let me choose PWD, but in /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log i can read, that wpa_supplicant has to be recompiled with PWD support.  Can you add PWD support and make students and researchers in Europe happy? ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c1)  Andreas Stieger   2018-09-21 08:03:39 UTC  ``` We have different accounts of this working. Hmm your own docs: <https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/802_1x/802_1x-linux-ubuntu/> Flo, does it not work at all or would this add another (better) option? Asking local openSUSE contributors who are in Eduroam range... ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c2)  Sarah Kriesch   2018-09-21 08:09:47 UTC  ``` I am at a conference at the Nuremberg Intitute of Technology at the moment. We are usinf WPA2-EAP for eduroam at our university and for our student accounts. It works fine on openSUSE Leap 15.0 at the moment. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c3)  Sarah Kriesch   2018-09-21 08:12:52 UTC  ``` my version: rpm -qa wpa_supplicant                                                                                                                                                                        wpa_supplicant-2.6-lp150.3.3.1.x86_64 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c4)  Sarah Kriesch   2018-09-21 08:26:03 UTC  ``` The difference between Nuremberg and LRZ is, that we have to use a Telekom certificate (CA-Zertifikat) additional to our account. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c5)  flo gleixner   2018-09-21 08:37:56 UTC  ``` You can choose the Authentication Method "PWD" in NetworkManager. PWD is much easier than PEAP and it is secure enough. It is the preferred method for Android devices today. While connecting to eduroam using PEAP works, when i try PWD, it silently fails. The Logfile /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log says:   Line 0: unknown EAP method 'PWD' You may need to add support for this EAP method during wpa_supplicant build time configuration.  The packet maintainer should set CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y and rebuild wpa_supplicant (preferred!) or the option should not be in the NetworkManager (not preferred!). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c6)  Sarah Kriesch   2018-09-21 09:26:36 UTC  ``` I know something like that from other universities. Our edurom works only with a special certificate and the following configuration: <https://www.th-nuernberg.de/fileadmin/global/Gelenkte_Doks/ZE/RZ/RZ_5404_HR_Eduroam-Linux_public.pdf>  I have been surprised about our wireless security, but no other configuration works.   Do we have Fernuni Students in the community/ at SUSE? They can use a configuration without Telekom certificate. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c7)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-21 09:34:03 UTC  ``` Thanks for bringing this up. I've created a couple of submit requests for our openSUSE products enabling this feature within wpa_supplicant this:  Factory: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/637009> Leap 15.0: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/637012> Leap 42.3: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/637014>  Our version of wpa_supplicant in Leap 42.3 is based on upstream version 2.2, which was vulnerable to a couple of CVEs in the EAP-PWD component (CVE-2015-5314, CVE-2015-5315, CVE-2015-5316), but they have been fixed with the patches  However, these patches are missing the CVE references and I don't want to simply add them to the changes file, since this will confuse our tooling. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c9)  Jan Engelhardt   2018-09-24 08:18:41 UTC  ``` Chiming in for the record. It also works with: WPA2 Enterprise, Tunneled TLS, anonymous@gwdg.de, and then MSCHAPv2 with a plaintext as inner authentication. On Android, something with PEAP. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1109209#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-26 12:41:58 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:3480-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is now available.

## Binary packages built by this source

[hostapd](/ubuntu/trusty/%2Bpackage/hostapd):
user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator

Originally, hostapd was an optional user space component for Host AP

 driver. It adds more features to the basic IEEE 802.11 management

 included in the kernel driver: using external RADIUS authentication

 server for MAC address based access control, IEEE 802.1X Authenticator

 and dynamic WEP keying, RADIUS accounting, WPA/WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i/RSN)

 Authenticator and dynamic TKIP/CCMP keying.

 .

 The current version includes support for other drivers, an integrated

 EAP authenticator (i.e., allow full authentication without requiring

 an external RADIUS authentication server), and RADIUS authentication

 server for EAP authentication.

 .

 hostapd works with the following drivers:

 .

  \* mac80211 based drivers with support for master mode [linux]

  \* Host AP driver for Prism2/2.5/3 [linux]

  \* Driver interface for FreeBSD net80211 layer [kfreebsd]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2018-08-08 14:34:09 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-14526  Published: August 8, 2018 Identifiers: - CVE-2018-14526 Latest version available from: <https://w1.fi/security/2018-1/>  Vulnerability  A vulnerability was found in how wpa_supplicant processes EAPOL-Key frames. It is possible for an attacker to modify the frame in a way that makes wpa_supplicant decrypt the Key Data field without requiring a valid MIC value in the frame, i.e., without the frame being authenticated. This has a potential issue in the case where WPA2/RSN style of EAPOL-Key construction is used with TKIP negotiated as the pairwise cipher. It should be noted that WPA2 is not supposed to be used with TKIP as the pairwise cipher. Instead, CCMP is expected to be used and with that pairwise cipher, this vulnerability is not applicable in practice.  When TKIP is negotiated as the pairwise cipher, the EAPOL-Key Key Data field is encrypted using RC4. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated EAPOL-Key frames to be processed and due to the RC4 design, this makes it possible for an attacker to modify the plaintext version of the Key Data field with bitwise XOR operations without knowing the contents. This can be used to cause a denial of service attack by modifying GTK/IGTK on the station (without the attacker learning any of the keys) which would prevent the station from accepting received group-addressed frames. Furthermore, this might be abused by making wpa_supplicant act as a decryption oracle to try to recover some of the Key Data payload (GTK/IGTK) to get knowledge of the group encryption keys.  Full recovery of the group encryption keys requires multiple attempts (128 connection attempts per octet) and each attempt results in disconnection due to a failure to complete the 4-way handshake. These failures can result in the AP/network getting disabled temporarily or even permanently (requiring user action to re-enable) which may make it impractical to perform the attack to recover the keys before the AP has already changes the group keys. By default, wpa_supplicant is enforcing at minimum a ten second wait time between each failed connection attempt, i.e., over 20 minutes waiting to recover each octet while hostapd AP implementation uses 10 minute default for GTK rekeying when using TKIP. With such timing behavior, practical attack would need large number of impacted stations to be trying to connect to the same AP to be able to recover sufficient information from the GTK to be able to determine the key before it gets changed.   Vulnerable versions/configurations  All wpa_supplicant versions.   Acknowledgments  Thanks to Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU Leuven for discovering and reporting this issue.   Possible mitigation steps  - Remove TKIP as an allowed pairwise cipher in RSN/WPA2 networks. This   can be done also on the AP side.  - Merge the following commits to wpa_supplicant and rebuild:    WPA: Ignore unauthenticated encrypted EAPOL-Key data    This patch is available from <https://w1.fi/security/2018-1/>  - Update to wpa_supplicant v2.7 or newer, once available  --  Jouni Malinen                                            PGP id EFC895FA   References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-14526> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-11 13:10:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1104205) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/641263> Factory / wpa_supplicant ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-12 09:00:11 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1104205) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/641410> Factory / wpa_supplicant ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-12 13:40:13 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1104205) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/641685> Factory / wpa_supplicant ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-19 11:20:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1104205) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/643156> Backports:SLE-15 / hostapd <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/643157> 15.0 / hostapd <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/643158> 42.3 / hostapd ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-23 07:50:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1104205) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/643892> 15.0+42.3+Backports:SLE-15 / hostapd ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1104205#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-10-26 12:41:44 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:3480-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is now available.

SUMMARY

The latest ﬁrmware updates for the SCALANCE W700 and W1700 wireless device families ﬁx a vulnera-
bility affecting WPA/WPA2 key handling. It might be possible to, by manipulating the EAPOL-Key frames,
decrypt the Key Data ﬁeld without the frame being authenticated.

This has impact on WPA/WPA2 architectures using TKIP encryption. The attacker must be in the wireless
range of the device to perform the attack.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Whenever possible, use AES-CCMP instead of TKIP in the WPA/WPA2 networks. This can be
conﬁgured for both SCALANCE W-700 and W-1700 families over the Web Based Management
(web server). For more information, go for the respective Manual.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE W700 products are wireless communication devices used to connect industrial components
like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SCALANCE W1700 products are wireless communication devices used to connect industrial components,
like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), according to the IEEE
802.11ac standard.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-14526

It was discovered that under certain conditions the integrity of EAPOL-key messages might not be
checked, leading to a decryption oracle.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker within range of the Access Point which
could allow the abuse of the vulnerability to access conﬁdential data. For this, the Access Point must
use TKIP as encryption method.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Unauthenticated EAPOL-Key decryption in wpa\_supplicant
Published: August 8, 2018
Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-14526
Latest version available from: https://w1.fi/security/2018-1/
Vulnerability
A vulnerability was found in how wpa\_supplicant processes EAPOL-Key
frames. It is possible for an attacker to modify the frame in a way that
makes wpa\_supplicant decrypt the Key Data field without requiring a
valid MIC value in the frame, i.e., without the frame being
authenticated. This has a potential issue in the case where WPA2/RSN
style of EAPOL-Key construction is used with TKIP negotiated as the
pairwise cipher. It should be noted that WPA2 is not supposed to be used
with TKIP as the pairwise cipher. Instead, CCMP is expected to be used
and with that pairwise cipher, this vulnerability is not applicable in
practice.
When TKIP is negotiated as the pairwise cipher, the EAPOL-Key Key Data
field is encrypted using RC4. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated
EAPOL-Key frames to be processed and due to the RC4 design, this makes
it possible for an attacker to modify the plaintext version of the Key
Data field with bitwise XOR operations without knowing the contents.
This can be used to cause a denial of service attack by modifying
GTK/IGTK on the station (without the attacker learning any of the keys)
which would prevent the station from accepting received group-addressed
frames. Furthermore, this might be abused by making wpa\_supplicant act
as a decryption oracle to try to recover some of the Key Data payload
(GTK/IGTK) to get knowledge of the group encryption keys.
Full recovery of the group encryption keys requires multiple attempts
(128 connection attempts per octet) and each attempt results in
disconnection due to a failure to complete the 4-way handshake. These
failures can result in the AP/network getting disabled temporarily or
even permanently (requiring user action to re-enable) which may make it
impractical to perform the attack to recover the keys before the AP has
already changes the group keys. By default, wpa\_supplicant is enforcing
at minimum a ten second wait time between each failed connection
attempt, i.e., over 20 minutes waiting to recover each octet while
hostapd AP implementation uses 10 minute default for GTK rekeying when
using TKIP. With such timing behavior, practical attack would need large
number of impacted stations to be trying to connect to the same AP to be
able to recover sufficient information from the GTK to be able to
determine the key before it gets changed.
Vulnerable versions/configurations
All wpa\_supplicant versions.
Acknowledgments
Thanks to Mathy Vanhoef of the imec-DistriNet research group of KU
Leuven for discovering and reporting this issue.
Possible mitigation steps
- Remove TKIP as an allowed pairwise cipher in RSN/WPA2 networks. This
can be done also on the AP side.
- Merge the following commits to wpa\_supplicant and rebuild:
WPA: Ignore unauthenticated encrypted EAPOL-Key data
This patch is available from https://w1.fi/security/2018-1/
- Update to wpa\_supplicant v2.7 or newer, once available

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

The wpa\_supplicant(8) utility is a client (supplicant) with support for WPA
and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for both desktop and laptop
computers as well as embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA
component that is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation
with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
authentication/association of the wlan(4) driver.
The wpa\_supplicant(8) utility is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs
in the background and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless
connection. The wpa\_supplicant(8) utility supports separate frontend programs
and a text-based frontend (wpa\_cli(8)) and a GUI (wpa\_gui) are included with
wpa\_supplicant(8).
II. Problem Description
When using WPA2, EAPOL-Key frames with the Encrypted flag and without the MIC
flag set, the data field was decrypted first without verifying the MIC. When
the dta field was encrypted using RC4, for example, when negotiating TKIP as
a pairwise cipher, the unauthenticated but decrypted data was subsequently
processed. This opened wpa\_supplicant(8) to abuse by decryption and recovery
of sensitive information contained in EAPOL-Key messages.
See https://w1.fi/security/2018-1/unauthenticated-eapol-key-decryption.txt
for a detailed description of the bug.
III. Impact
All users of the WPA2 TKIP pairwise cipher are vulnerable to information, for
example, the group key.
IV. Workaround
Remove TKIP as an allowed pairwise cipher in RSN/WPA2 networks in
wpa\_supplicant.conf(5) by changing 'pairwise=CCMP TKIP' to 'pariwise=CCMP'.
This can also be mitigated by removing TKIP as a cipher on the AP.
Systems and users who do not use WPA2 TKIP are not affected.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.x]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:11/hostapd.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:11/hostapd.patch.asc
# gpg --verify hostapd.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:11/hostapd-10.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:11/hostapd-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify hostapd-10.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

Abstract

We show how to efﬁciently simulate cryptographic prim-
itives during symbolic execution. This allows analysis of
security protocol implementations, and revealed several
ﬂaws in implementations of WPA2’s 4-way handshake.
Traditional symbolic execution engines cannot handle
cryptographic primitives, because analyzing them results
in complex symbolic expressions that cannot be handled
by the SMT solver. We prevent this by simulating their
behaviour under the Dolev-Yao model. This enables ef-
ﬁcient symbolic execution of security protocols imple-
mentations, making it possible to detect common pro-
gramming mistakes in them. We also show how to de-
tect misuse of cryptographic primitives. That is, we can
detect trivial timing side-channels, and we can identify
decryption oracles where unauthenticated decrypted data
inﬂuences the program’s behaviour. We apply our tech-
nique on three client-side implementations of WPA2’s
4-way handshake. This uncovered timing side-channels
when verifying authentication tags, a denial-of-service
attack, a stack-based buffer overﬂow, and also revealed a
non-trivial decryption oracle. We conﬁrmed all vulnera-
bilities in practice, and discuss them in detail.

Introduction

Implementing security protocols is a tedious and error-
prone task. Unfortunately, history shows that any errors
or bugs in a security protocol implementation can lead to
devastating vulnerabilities. For example, an integer over-
ﬂow in OpenSSH allowed an adversary to remotely ex-
ecute arbitrary code on affected servers [13, 40]. Older
versions of OpenSSH even had a vulnerability that al-
lowed code execution on both clients and servers [12].
the Heartbleed vulnerability in
As another example,
OpenSSL allowed an adversary to compromise all Trans-
port Layer Security (TLS) connections made to a vulner-
able server [2, 23]. Comparable failures also occurred

in other implementations of the TLS protocol [41], and
in implementations of other security protocols such as
Wi-Fi Protected Access two (WPA2) [51], IPsec [17],
Bluetooth [14], RSA key generation algorithms [39], and
so on. In all these examples, implementation issues un-
dermined the security guarantees normally provided by
the protocol. Inspired by these observations, our goal is
to use symbolic execution, instead of traditional fuzzing,
to ﬁnd bugs in security protocol implementations.

Traditional fuzzing is used by several previous works
to test security protocol implementations. Here, concrete
input is fed to an implementation, after which its be-
haviour is monitored for irregularities. This was used to
test protocols such as TLS, and revealed ﬂaws in the state
machines of several libraries [5, 19], uncovered ﬂawed
client-side X.509 certiﬁcate parsers [9, 16], and detected
various buffer boundary violations [44]. However, a ma-
jor downside of fuzzing is that it may not explore all code
paths, meaning certain vulnerabilities remain undetected.
In contrast to fuzzing, symbolic execution attempts to
exhaustively explore all code paths of a program. This
is done by running the program on symbolic inputs, in-
stead of on concrete ones. When a branch is encountered
that depends on symbolic input, execution is forked,
and all feasible paths are explored. This technique has
been used to test a DHCP server [11], to verify prop-
erties of distributed protocols [42], and to check proto-
col requirements of Zeroconf and DHCP implementa-
tions [45]. However, handling security protocols that use
cryptographic primitives, such as encryption and authen-
tication, remains challenging. The main obstacle is that
the cryptographic primitives in these protocols generate
complex symbolic expressions, which cannot be handled
by the SMT solver. We show how this problem can be
avoided by simulating the behaviour of cryptographic
primitives, instead of symbolically executing them.

Apart from using symbolic execution to detect com-
mon programming mistakes, we also present techniques
to discover misuse of cryptographic primitives. In partic-

ular, we can detect when authentication tags are not ver-
iﬁed in constant-time. Moreover, we can also detect de-
cryption oracles, where an implementation’s behaviour
is inﬂuenced by decrypted but unauthenticated data.

To evaluate our techniques, we implement them on top
of the KLEE symbolic execution engine [10], and apply
our tool to three client-side implementations of WPA2’s
4-way handshake. Note that this handshake is used by
nearly all protected Wi-Fi networks, and provides both
mutual authentication and session key agreement. This
revealed several vulnerabilities. First, two clients verify
authentication tags using timing-unsafe memory com-
pares, resulting in trivial timing side-channels. Sec-
ond, Intel’s iwd daemon contains a denial-of-service vul-
nerability that can be triggered by a malicious Access
Point (AP). Third, MediaTek’s implementation contains
a stack-based buffer overﬂow in code that processes de-
crypted data, which can be exploited by a malicious AP.
Fourth, wpa supplicant contains an non-trivial decryp-
tion oracle that is caused by processing decrypted but
unauthenticated data. This decryption oracle can be ex-
ploited when the victim connects to a WPA2 network us-
ing the old TKIP encryption algorithm. It can be abused
to decrypt the group key transported in message 3 of
the 4-way handshake. Finally, when manually preparing
MediaTek’s code for symbolic execution, we also dis-
covered that it incorrectly implemented the AES unwrap
algorithm. We conﬁrmed all vulnerabilities in practice,
and will explain them in detail.

To summarize, our main contributions are:

• We modify the KLEE symbolic execution engine to
efﬁciently handle cryptographic primitives, by sim-
ulating their behaviour under the Dolev-Yao model.

• We show how to detect timing side-channels and de-
cryption oracles that are caused by improper use of
(legacy) cryptographic primitives.

• We evaluate our technique against WPA2’s 4-way
handshake, and explain how all discovered vulnera-
bilities can be exploited in practice.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 introduces symbolic execution, and relevant as-
pects of the 802.11 standard. Section 3 explains how we
simulate cryptographic primitives, and in Section 4 we
apply our technique to the 4-way handshake of WPA2.
We discuss our results in Section 5, and go over related
work in Section 6 . Finally, we conclude in Section 7.

2 Background

In this section we introduce symbolic execution [34], go
over the main features of WPA2, and explain how the
4-way handshake works [31].

2.1 Symbolic Execution

Traditional fuzzing techniques, where random input is
generated and fed to a program, are unable to explore
all possible code paths within reasonable time. For ex-
ample, the conditional statement “if (x==137) then”
only has one in 232 chance of being fulﬁlled if x is a ran-
dom 32-bit input value. Symbolic execution overcomes
this problem by running the program not on random con-
crete inputs, but on symbolic inputs [34]. During such
a symbolic execution, the program memory and output
values are represented by symbolic expressions over the
symbolic input values. Additionally, when a conditional
statement is encountered, symbolic execution is forked
over all feasible branches. This assures that all code
paths (i.e. sequences of conditional branches) that the
program might execute are analyzed. For each code path,
a path constraint is maintained that deﬁnes the inputs for
which the program executes along this path. Put differ-
ently, the path constraint records all conditions the sym-
bolic input must satisfy for an execution to reach a par-
ticular location in the program. To determine whether a
conditional branch is feasible, and to generate concrete
inputs that follow certain code paths, a boolean satisﬁ-
ability problem (SAT) solver or a Satisﬁability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solver is used. Several open and closed
source tools implement this technique, with examples be-
ing DART [26], KLEE [10], and SAGE [27].

Symbolic execution has two main limitations. First,
certain queries to the SMT solver can be slow to practi-
cally unsolvable. The second problem is a state explo-
sion when analysing large programs, where there are an
exponential number of code paths in the program. We
show how these limitations can be managed when sym-
bolically executing security protocols.

2.2 Wi-Fi Protected Access

A connection to a modern protected Wi-Fi network is
managed using a Robust Security Network (RSN) associ-
ation. The technical features and capabilities of an RSN
association are deﬁned in the 802.11 standard [31, §12].
A subset of RSN is certiﬁed by the Wi-Fi Alliance un-
der the more well-known name Wi-Fi Protected Access
version two (WPA2). The ﬁrst version, called WPA, was
based on a draft of the standard. This means that WPA
is almost identical to WPA2. Moreover, they both sup-
port the older (WPA-)TKIP encryption protocol, and the
more modern (AES-)CCMP protocol. An AP advertises
its supported encryption protocols in periodically broad-
casted beacons. When connecting to a network, the client
informs the AP which encryption protocol (i.e. cipher
suite) it wants to use, and then executes the 4-way hand-
shake to establish a secure connection.

Figure 1: Simpliﬁed overview of the messages ex-
changed when executing the 4-way handshake between
a client (supplicant) and an AP (authenticator).

Figure 1 illustrates the messages exchanged during the
4-way handshake. During this handshake, the client is
called the supplicant, and the AP is called the authenti-
cator (we use these terms as synonyms). The AP starts
by sending message 1, which contains a random num-
ber called the ANonce. This message is the only one
that is not protected by a Message Integrity Code (MIC).
In response, the client replies with message 2, which
contains a random SNonce. Once both endpoints learn
each other’s nonces, they combine them with a shared se-
cret to derive a session key called the Pairwise Transient
Key (PTK). The third message is sent by the AP, and if
WPA2 is used, it will contain the group key (GTK) used
by the network. In case the older WPA protocol is used,
the GTK is transported to the client in a separate group
key handshake. Finally, the client replies with message 4,
and installs the session key (PTK).

All messages in the 4-way handshake are deﬁned us-
ing EAPOL-Key frames. The structure of these frames is
shown in Figure 2. To symbolically execute implementa-
tions of the 4-way handshake, and to understand our dis-
covered attacks, we will brieﬂy discuss the most impor-
tant ﬁelds. First, the 5-byte header deﬁnes the length of
the frame and its type. This header is followed by the key
information ﬁeld. It contains a 3-bits key descriptor ver-
sion subﬁeld, and eight one-bit ﬂags that called the key
info ﬂags. For us, only the MIC and encrypted ﬂags are
important. If the MIC ﬂag is set, the authenticity of the
frame is protected using a MIC. When the encrypted ﬂag
is set, the key data ﬁeld is encrypted. The key descriptor
ﬁeld deﬁnes the cipher suite that is used for authentica-
tion and encryption. This is either AES with HMAC-
SHA1, or RC4 with HMAC-MD5. The choice between

these cipher suites, and hence the value of the key de-
scriptor ﬁeld, depends on the pairwise cipher selected
by the client. More precisely, if CCMP is chosen, AES
wrap [43] with HMAC-SHA1 is used for encryption and
authentication, respectively. Otherwise, RC4 encryption
with HMAC-MD5 is used. For example, when WPA2
is used, the group key is stored in the key data ﬁeld of
message 3, meaning it is encrypted with the PTK using
either RC4 or AES wrap. The content of the key data
ﬁeld is encoded using Information Elements (IEs), and
will be explained in more detail in Section 4.2. Finally,
the replay counter ﬁeld is used to detect replayed frames.
The AP increments the replay counter after transmitting
a new frame. When the client receives a frame, it ﬁrst
assures the replay counter is fresh, and it will then echo
the received replay counter in its response.

Note that in Figure 1 we used the notation

MsgN(r, Nonce; GTK)

to succinctly describe messages. It represents message N
of the 4-way handshake, having a replay counter of r, and
with the given nonce (if present). All parameters after the
semicolon are stored in the key data ﬁeld, and hence are
encrypted using the PTK.

3 Handling Cryptographic Operations

In this Section we show how to efﬁciently simulate cryp-
tographic primitives during symbolic execution. Build-
ing on top of this, we also present a technique to detect
misuse of legacy cryptographic primitives.

3.1 Simulating Cryptographic Primitives

Our ﬁrst goal is to efﬁciently perform symbolic execution
of security protocol implementation, in other words, of
protocols that use cryptographic primitives. Consider for
instance the following typical code snippet:

1 def handle_packet(session, packet):
2

# Verify authenticity and decrypt packet
data = aead_decrypt(session.key, packet)
if data == None: return

if data[0] == COMMAND: process_command(payload)
# Continue processing all payload types ...

Here the receiver ﬁrst veriﬁes and decrypts the incoming
packet. If successful, the packet’s payload is parsed and
processed. When using traditional symbolic execution to
analyse this code, and marking the packet as symbolic,
a complex symbolic expression will be assigned to the
decrypted data variable (in a sense this is what encryp-
tion is designed to do). A consequence of this is that any
evaluations on the decrypted payload result in complex
queries to the SMT solver. These queries are either slow,
or cannot be answered in reasonable time. For example,
when using KLEE to symbolically execute ChaCha20,
the resulting SMT queries took several seconds to com-
plete. Though this is not very slow, other encryption al-
gorithms, such as AES in either counter or CBC mode,
resulted in signiﬁcantly slower queries. Moreover, when
symbolically executing RC4, it took too long to generate
the symbolic expression of the decrypted data variable.
All combined, this means that in practice the input pro-
cessing code will not be fully explored, or may not even
be reached at all. This is problematic, because many vul-
nerabilities are present precisely at locations where (de-
crypted) input is parsed and processed [36].

To enable efﬁcient symbolic execution of code that
employs cryptographic primitives, we will simulate their
behaviour, and thereby avoid generating complex sym-
bolic symbolic expressions. In particular, we will sim-
ulate encryption, decryption, and hash functions under
the Dolev-Yao model [20]. That is, we assume crypto-
graphic primitives are perfect and unbreakable.

To simulate decryption, we treat the decrypted output
of a cryptographic primitive as a fresh (unconstrained)
symbolic variable. We also record the relationship be-
tween the symbolic input, and the new symbolic output.
This will allow us to determine the source of symbolic
variables representing decrypted data. More precisely,
after symbolic execution completed or was halted, the
recorded relationships can be used to manually construct
ciphertext that decrypts to the desired (concrete) plain-
text. Although automatically constructing such cipher-
texts should be possible, our tool does not support this
currently. More importantly, since the decrypted output
is a fresh symbolic variable, it can now easily be ana-

lyzed without resulting in complex queries to the SMT
solver. Encryption is simulated in an analogous manner.
We employ a similar approach to simulate hash func-
tions, by treating the output (i.e. the digest) as a fresh
symbolic variable. As a result, complex SMT queries are
avoided when the output of a hash function is compared
to another (concrete or symbolic) variable. Again we
record the relationship between the fresh symbolic vari-
able representing the output, and the inputs of the hash
function. Similarly, Hash-based Message Authentication
Codes (HMACs) can also be simulated by treating the
output as a fresh symbolic variable, and recording that
this new variable is the output of an HMAC primitive.

Primitives that combine authentication and encryption
(i.e. authenticated encryption) can be simulated in one
step, similar to how encryption and decryption is simu-
lated. For instance, the primitive aead decrypt in our
example code is simulated by treating data as a fresh
symbolic variable, and recording that the new symbolic
variable was the result of applying the authenticated de-
cryption primitive to the symbolic packet variable.

3.2 Detecting Misuse of Legacy Crypto

Several protocols still support older cryptographic prim-
itives for backwards compatibility. One common exam-
ple is that authentication and encryption is provided by
two different primitives. For example, encryption may
be done using RC4, and authentication using an HMAC.
If for some reason the implementation does not properly
combine these primitives, it may be vulnerable to attacks.
We show how to detect two common misuses of cryp-
tographic primitives. First, we can detect if an authenti-
cation tag (e.g. the output of an HMAC) is not securely
compared to its expected value. Second, we can detect
if there are code paths were data is decrypted but not au-
thenticated.

To detect if an authentication tag is not securely com-
pared to its expected value, we search for all code paths
where only a few bytes of the digest are in the path con-
straint. This indicates that either the digest was trun-
cated, or that it is being compared to its expected value
using a timing-unsafe memory comparison. Both cases
indicate the presence of a vulnerability, where the adver-
sary can abuse timing information to guess or determine
valid authentication tags.

To detect if data is decrypted but not authenticated,
we ﬁrst isolate code paths where such decrypted data in-
ﬂuences the behaviour of the implementation. This is
done by seeing if the output of an unauthenticated de-
cryption primitive occurs either in the path constraint, or
in the payload of a transmitted packet. In a sense, we
use the fresh symbolic variables created to simulate cryp-
tographic primitives as an information ﬂow taint. Note

that, if for some reason the decrypted data is not pro-
cessed, there is no risk, since we assume the decryption
primitive itself does not leak any information. For ev-
ery individual code path and decrypted data, we check if
there is a corresponding call to an authentication primi-
tive (e.g. an HMAC). More precisely, it must hold that:

1. Either the full ciphertext, or the decrypted data, is
used as an input of an authentication primitive.

2. The output digest of the authentication primitive

must be fully present in the path constraint.

The ﬁrst condition handles both encrypt-then-mac and
mac-then-encrypt constructions, and assures that all de-
crypted bytes are authenticated. The second condition
assures that the digest is correctly veriﬁed. If these con-
ditions are not met, we know that decrypted but unau-
thenticated data inﬂuences the behaviour of the program,
which in practice might lead to decryption oracles.

3.3

Implementation

We implemented our extensions on top of the KLEE
symbolic execution engine [10], and this code is avail-
able for download [1]. In particular, we ﬁrst extended
KLEE with an operation to record relationships between
two (possibly symbolic) variables. Then we imple-
mented a library that can be used to simulate authenti-
cated and non-authenticated decryption, and that simu-
lates hash and HMAC functions. Decryption is simulated
by marking the output buffer as a fresh symbolic variable
using klee make symbolic, and recording the relation-
ship between the input and output as being the result of
an (authenticated) decryption primitive. Hashing primi-
tives are simulated similarly: the output is marked as a
fresh symbolic variable, and a relationship is recorded
between the input of the hash function and its output.

4 Analyzing the 4-way Handshake

In this Section we explain how we applied our modiﬁed
symbolic execution technique to three client-side imple-
mentations of the 4-way handshake.

4.1

Isolating the 4-way Handshake

Symbolically analyzing the 4-way handshake is a chal-
lenging use case because there are, to the best of our
knowledge, no implementations that isolate the hand-
shake code in a separate library. In contrast, other proto-
cols such as TLS are generally implemented in a stand-
alone library that isolates the protocol code from other
aspects of a program. This makes it harder to symboli-
cally execute implementations of the 4-way handshake,

since we cannot simply initialize a library, and then feed
it symbolic packets as input. Instead, we have to either
symbolically execute the full client implementation, in-
cluding its wireless stack, or manually isolate the 4-way
handshake code into a separate library.

The ﬁrst 4-way handshake implementation we inves-
tigated is the one contained in Intel’s iwd deamon. This
is a fairly new wireless daemon, designed to run on em-
bedded devices [30]. Fortunately, symbolically execut-
ing the 4-way handshake in this case is straightforward.
We can base ourselves on unit tests that initialize relevant
parts of the client, and then tests the 4-way handshake as
if it was isolated in a separate library. That is, we take an
existing unit test, provide symbolic instead of concrete
inputs, and then replace all cryptographic primitives with
functions that symbolically simulate their behaviour.

The second client we studied is wpa supplicant, which
is the de facto Wi-Fi client on Linux and Android. Sym-
bolically executing its 4-way handshake code is non-
trivial. One option is to execute the full wpa supplicant
client under KLEE, however, this requires the simula-
tion of large parts of the 802.11 netlink kernel interface.
This would mean writing a library that symbolically sim-
ulates netlink API calls such as network interface conﬁg-
uration, network scanning, wireless station management,
and so on. A more practical option is inspired by the
success of analyzing iwd. In particular, we opted to ﬁrst
write test cases that initialize wpa supplicant and test the
4-way handshake using concrete inputs. Once these unit
tests were working, we used them as a basis for sym-
bolically executing the 4-way handshake. This approach
also has the advantage that it now becomes easier to ana-
lyze the 4-way handshake of wpa supplicant using other
tools. Indeed, other tools can now use our unit test as a
basis to analyze the handshake without having to simu-
late or handle the 802.11 netlink kernel interface.

The third implementation we tested is contained in
the kernel driver of MediaTek’s Wi-Fi chips. Note that
this driver is commonly used in routers, access points,
and wireless repeaters. Given that the 4-way handshake
is implemented in a kernel driver, it is again non-trivial
to symbolically execute it. Nevertheless, similar to iwd
and wpa supplicant, we managed to isolate relevant code
and write unit tests for it. That is, we ﬁrst wrote a user-
land program that simulates kernel functions used by the
driver, initializes global structures, and is then able to call
the 4-way handshake code using concrete inputs. Once
this worked, all that was required was changing the input
from concrete packets to symbolic ones.

4.2 Constraining Information Elements

The key data ﬁeld of 4-way handshake messages is en-
coded using (cid:104)t, (cid:96), v(cid:105) triples. Here t represents the type,

Listing 1: Instructions executed by iwd’s decrypt func-
tion when AES unwrap is used. Note that this is a sim-
pliﬁed overview: iwd’s real function is more complex.

and subsequently installs the extracted group key.

uint8_t *buf = l_new(uint8_t, expected_len);

if (key_data_len < 24 || key_data_len % 8)

return NULL;

if (!aes_unwrap(kek, key_data, key_data_len, buf))

return NULL;

and (cid:96) denotes the length of the value v in bytes. Hence,
these are commonly called type-length-value triplets,
and in the 802.11 standard they are called Information
Elements (IEs). Certain types, such the Key Data cryp-
tographic Encapsulation (KDE), have values that are fur-
ther subdivided into their own type-length-value triplets.
When marking the whole key data ﬁeld as symbolic,
this causes a huge state explosion. For example, if there
are n supported types, they can occur in n! different or-
ders. Additionally, each type has a symbolic length and
value, causing additional state explosions.

We avoid state explosions during the parsing of the key
data ﬁeld by constraining the structure of the information
elements (i.e. the type-length-value triplets). This is done
by assigning concrete values to the ﬁelds t and (cid:96), and
requiring all types to occur in a ﬁxed order. Concrete
values for t and (cid:96) are derived from the 802.11 standard.
Currently we support the two types required by WPA2,
namely the RSN element, and the KDE element which
contains the current group key. By supporting only these
two elements, we indirectly also constrain the length of
the key data ﬁeld, and therefore also constrain the total
length of handshake messages.

5 Discovered Vulnerabilities

In this section we ﬁrst discuss common programming
mistakes that were discovered, and then we discuss mis-
use of cryptographic primitives. We also explain in detail
whether and how all vulnerabilities can be exploited.

5.1 Denial-of-Service Attacks

Against Intel’s iwd daemon we discovered a denial-of-
service attack. The vulnerability is located in the func-

tion eapol decrypt key data, which is shown in List-
ing 1. The root cause of the ﬂaw is on line 7: when the
length of the key data ﬁeld is smaller than 8, the unsigned
variable expected len will overﬂow to a large positive
number. This causes the memory allocation on the next
line to fail, which automatically aborts the program. In
case the length of the key data ﬁeld equals 8, l new will
be called to allocate zero bytes. This causes it to return
NULL, resulting in NULL-deference, causing the program
to terminate. Although there is a length check on line 10,
this check is performed too late. We tested both attack
scenario’s in practice against version 0.3 of iwd. This
conﬁrmed our predictions, meaning an attacker can in-
deed exploit the integer underﬂow on line 7 as a denial-
of-service attack. At the time of writing the vulnerability
had been patched [33], but was not yet assigned a Com-
mon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identiﬁer.

5.2 Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Two stack-based buffer overﬂows were discovered in
MediaTek’s implementation of the 4-way handshake.
They were assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Ex-
posures (CVE) identiﬁer CVE-2018-14525. Both over-
ﬂows occur in the function RTMPParseEapolKeyData,
which parses the key data ﬁeld of handshake messages.

Listing 2 contains a simpliﬁed version of the func-
tion. First, if WPA2 is used, the function searches for
the KDE information element containing the group key.
Once found, its group key is copied to the stack vari-
able GTK (see line 19). Unfortunately, it is not checked
whether the length of the group key is smaller or equal
to MAX LEN GTK. Second, when the older WPA variant is
used, the key data ﬁeld contains the group key as-is. This
key is copied to the stack on line 22. However, again
there is no check to assure there is enough space to save
the group key.

An attacker can exploit these stack-based buffer over-
ﬂows by setting up a malicious WPA or WPA2 network,
and tricking victims into connecting to it. During the
4-way handshake the malicious AP then sends a mes-
sage 3 that triggers the buffer overﬂow. When using
WPA this is accomplished with a large key data ﬁeld,
and when using WPA2 this is done by including a KDE
element containing a large group key. Given that Media-
Tek implements the 4-way handshake in a kernel driver,
successfully exploiting the buffer overﬂow results in full
control over the victim’s device.

We conﬁrmed the vulnerability in practice against an
Asus RT-AC51U router that operated as a repeater. After
notifying MediaTek, they also conﬁrmed the vulnerabil-
ity, and were preparing a patch.

5.3 Timing Side-Channels

Our symbolic execution technique also revealed timing
side-channels in both iwd and MediaTek’s 4-way hand-
shake. In particular, both use the timing sensitive memcmp
function to compare the expected HMAC output with
the received one. We conjecture that exploiting these
side-channels is challenging in practice. This is because
memcmp compares several bytes at once on most plat-
forms, and even if it compares bytes one-by-one, the re-
sulting time differences are hard to measure over a net-
work [35]. Nevertheless, these details depend on the type
of platform that the client is running on, and therefore we
do treat these timing side-channels as vulnerabilities.

We remark that wpa supplicant is not affected by tim-
ing attacks, because it uses its own timing-safe variant of
memcmp called os memcmp const.

5.4 Decryption Oracle

We found a decryption oracle in wpa supplicant, where
the behaviour of the client is inﬂuenced by decrypted
but unauthenticated data. This vulnerability has been
assigned the identiﬁer CVE-2018-14526. Listing 3 il-
lustrates the root cause of the vulnerability. First, on
line 6 the authenticity of the frame is veriﬁed when the

coming EAPOL-Key frames. Here the key data ﬁeld may
be decrypted without ﬁrst checking its authenticity.

MIC ﬂag is set in the key information ﬁeld. Then it de-
crypts the key data ﬁeld on line 11 if both the encrypted
ﬂag is set, and if WPA2 is used, i.e., when sm->proto
equals WPA PROTO RSN. Combined, when setting the En-
cryption ﬂag but not the MIC ﬂag, the client will decrypt
the key data ﬁeld without ﬁrst verifying the authentic-
ity of the frame. The function then checks whether the
incoming frame represents message 1 or 3 of the 4-way
handshake, and continues to process it further.

When processing either message 1 or 3, and using
WPA2, the (possibly decrypted) key data ﬁeld is parsed
using the function shown in Listing 4. This function
parses and validates the type-length-value information
elements contained in the key data ﬁeld. Important for us
is that, depending on the content of the data, parsing may
fail (see line 13-14). When parsing fails, the client aborts
the handshake and disconnects from the network. When
parsing succeeds, it continues with processing the frame,
and replies with the next handshake message if all other
checks are successful. We will abuse this difference in
behaviour as a side-channel to recover encrypted infor-
mation. More precisely, our goal is to decrypt the group
key that the AP transports to the client in message 3 of
the handshake. We will accomplish this by manipulat-
ing the encrypted key data ﬁeld, and deriving plaintext
values based on response(s) of the client.

Two conditions must be met before we can launch a
decryption oracle attack. First, our attack is only possi-
ble if WPA2 is used. When WPA is used instead, the key
data ﬁeld is not decrypted due to the check on line 10
in Listing 3. Second, the client must select TKIP as the
pairwise cipher. Otherwise, if the client selects CCMP,

formation elements in the (decrypted) key data ﬁeld.

the AES wrap algorithm is used to protect the key data
ﬁeld (recall Section 2). Since AES wrap includes its
own authenticity check [43], we will not able to ma-
nipulate the decrypted plaintext to construct a decryp-
tion oracle. In contrast, when the client selects TKIP, the
key data ﬁeld is encrypted using the RC4 stream cipher.
This means an adversary can ﬂip bits in the decrypted
plaintext, by ﬂipping the corresponding bit in the cipher-
text. Interestingly, both conditions are automatically ful-
ﬁlled when a Wi-Fi network uses WPA2 and only sup-
ports TKIP. After all, in that case the client must use
WPA2 with TKIP. Based on a wardrive capture made in
2016 [48], roughly 20% of protected Wi-Fi networks use
this conﬁguration. Hence, in practice the decryption ora-
cle can be exploited against 20% of protected networks.

Before we can launch our attack, and decrypt the
group key contained in a captured message 3, we must
let the client successfully complete the handshake. Oth-
erwise, the client will refuse to decrypt the key data ﬁeld,
because a session key has not yet been negotiated. Once
the client completed the 4-way handshake, an adversary
can decrypt the group key transported in message 3 as
follows. First, the adversary clears the MIC ﬂag in the
captured message 3. As a result, wpa supplicant will
no longer check the authenticity of the frame, but will
still decrypt the key data ﬁeld since the Encrpyted ﬂag
is still set. The modiﬁed frame will now be treated as
a message 1 (see line 15 in Listing 3). The adversary
also manipulates the encrypted key data ﬁeld, in order to

concrete example recovering byte x31 is shown in the sec-
ond ﬁgure, which can be generalized to recover any byte.

construct a decryption oracle that will reveal the plain-
text byte-by-byte.
In particular, the length ﬁeld of the
KDE element which contains the group key is reduced,
causing the next type-length-value triplet to start in the
middle of the group key (see Figure 3). We only reserve
two bytes for this new type-length-value triplet, and dis-
card any bytes after it. This effectively creates an empty
information element. Parsing the decrypted key data now
only succeeds if the length ﬁeld of this newly created in-
formation element equals zero. This enables us to guess
the plaintext byte value at the location of the length ﬁeld.
In particular, we guess the value of the group key at this
location, and use the guessed value to ﬂip bits in the ci-
phertext to set the length ﬁeld to zero. If the guess was
correct, parsing succeeds, and the client replies with a
new message 2. If the guess was wrong, parsing fails,
and the client disconnects from the network. Since the
group key remains identical between different connec-
tions, the adversary can continue with guessing and try-
ing the next value, even when the key data ﬁeld is en-
crypted under a new session key. Once the group key has
been fully recovered, it can be used to inject both broad-
cast and unicast trafﬁc, and can even be used to decrypt
unicast and broadcast trafﬁc [49].

We conﬁrmed the vulnerability against version 2.6 of
wpa supplicant on Debian 8 (“Jessie”), using the virtual
mac80211 hwsim Wi-Fi driver [1]. Against this conﬁgu-
ration, an adversary can guess a plaintext value every 14
seconds. Hence, decrypting a 16-byte group key would
take 8 hours on average. To speed up the decryption pro-
cess, an adversary can attack multiple clients in paral-
lel. For instance, when attacking 16 clients in parallel,
it takes less than 30 minutes to decrypt a 16-byte group
key. Finally, we remark that the attack is only possible if
the client accepts plaintext EAPOL-Key messages when
a PTK has already been installed. Previous work has
shown that several platforms meet this requirement [50].

We have notiﬁed wpa supplicant of the vulnerability.
It has been assigned the identiﬁer CVE-2018-14526, and
a patch is being worked on.

5.5 Flawed Decryption Primitives

Finally, two bugs were discovered manually, before sym-
bolically executing any code. That is, when preparing
MediaTek’s cryptographic function AES_Key_Unwrap
for symbolic execution, which implements the AES un-
wrap algorithm, we observed that it did not check the
resulting Initialization Vector (IV). Normally this IV
must equal 0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6 after decryption, oth-
erwise the decrypted data is deemed inauthentic [43].
However, the IV is never checked, meaning decrypted
data is always treated as authentic.

Additionally, the AES unwrap function also does not
check whether the ciphertext length is a multiple of 8
bytes. This means that if the length is not divisible by 8,
trailing data smaller than 8 bytes is copied as-is to the
output buffer. An adversary can abuse this to inject up
to 7 plaintext bytes at the end of the ciphertext.

Recall from Section 2 that all 4-way handshake mes-
sages, except message 1, are also protected by a MIC
over the full EAPOL-Key frame. This means an attacker
would ﬁrst have to bypass this MIC check, before they
can exploit MediaTek’s vulnerable AES unwrap imple-
mentation. Fortunately, this does not appear possible.
This means that MediaTek’s ﬂawed AES unwrap prim-
itive, at least when used in the 4-way handshake, is not
exploitable in practice. Nevertheless, we notiﬁed Media-
Tek about these bugs, and they have reportedly patched
them in the meantime.

6 Related Work

Several techniques exist to evaluate the correctness of
network protocols. First, a protocol design can be for-
mally modelled and its properties can be proven [8, 29].
Additionally, it is possible to create a reference imple-
mentation of the protocol in a custom language, and
then prove security properties about these implementa-
tions [7, 6, 25]. The downside of this approach is that
existing protocol implementations cannot be veriﬁed in
this manner.

Model checking has also been used to verify proper-
ties of a protocol [21, 32, 37]. One interesting exam-
ple is ASPIER, which combines software model check-
ing with standard protocol security models to analyze
properties of bounded instances of the OpenSSL hand-
shake [15]. Another tool that analyzes implementations
is CSur [28]. It models the protocol using Horn clauses,
to subsequently prove certain properties. Dupressoir et
al. [22] used VCC to prove memory safety and security

properties of protocols written in C. Finally, static analy-
sis can also be used to check the correctness of concrete
implementations or conﬁgurations [47, 52, 24].

Symbolic execution is a general technique to discover
bugs in programs [34]. Several modern tools implement
this technique, examples are DART [26], KLEE [10], and
SAGE [27]. Symbolic execution has two main limita-
tions. First, certain queries to the SMT solver can be
slow to practically unsolvable. Second, a state explo-
sion might occur when analysing large programs. Aizat-
ulin et al. [3, 4] combine symbolic execution with proof
techniques, by using it to extract a ProVerif model from
a protocol implementation written in C. Unfortunately,
their technique is limited to protocols without branching,
because it only considers a single code path. Chau et
al. [16] use symbolic execution to test X.509 parsers in
TLS protocols. Unfortunately, only the X.509 parser was
symbolically analysed, and the implementation logic of
the TLS protocol itself was not considered. Our tech-
nique to constrain information elements is similar to the
one employed by Chau et al. when symbolically execut-
ing X.509 certiﬁcate parsers [16]. Finally, Corin et al.
simulate cryptographic primitives during symbolic ex-
ecution using rewriting rules [18]. However, their ap-
proach does not enable efﬁcient analysis of code that
processes decrypted data. In contrast, our approach does
allow this.

The 4-way handshake has been extensively studied.
First, He et al. proved the soundness of its design [29].
Nevertheless, it was recently shown vulnerable to key re-
installation attacks [50]. The handshake was also found
to be vulnerable to certain downgrade attacks [49], and
it is vulnerable to dictionary attacks [38]. Researchers
also performed model-based testing of the 4-way hand-
shake [51], and used state machine learning to discover
various vulnerabilities in implementations of the 4-way
handshake [46].

7 Conclusion

We successfully applied symbolic execution to client-
side implementations of the 4-way handshake of WPA2,
by simulating cryptographic primitives, and constraining
parts of the symbolic input to prevent excessive state ex-
plosions. This revealed memory corruptions in code that
processes decrypted data, uncovered insecure implemen-
tations of cryptographic primitives, and even revealed a
decryption oracle. We consider this surprising, as our
current symbolic execution technique is quite straightfor-
ward, yet still revealed vulnerabilities in all three tested
implementations. Inspired by these results, we consider
it interesting future work to further extend and improve
our techniques. We also believe it is worthwhile to apply
them on other security protocol implementations.

# Siemens SCALANCE W700 and W1700

Last RevisedDecember 10, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-344-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 6.5**
* **ATTENTION:** Low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Siemens
* **Equipment:** SCALANCE W700 and W1700
* **Vulnerability:** Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access confidential data.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of SCALANCE W700 and W1700, wireless communication devices, are affected:

* SCALANCE W700 Versions 6.3 and prior
* SCALANCE W1700 Versions 1.0 and prior

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends installing the following software updates to address this vulnerability:

* SCALANCE W700: [Update to v6.4 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109773308)
* SCALANCE W1700: [Update to v1.1 or later](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109762253)

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Whenever possible, use AES-CCMP instead of TKIP in the WPA/WPA2 networks. This can be configured for both the SCALANCE W-700 and W-1700 families over the Web Based Management (web server). For more information, go for the respective Manual.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security) and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:

<https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information on this vulnerability and more detailed mitigation instructions, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-344983 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
