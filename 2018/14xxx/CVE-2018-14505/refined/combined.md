## Description

[![@atx](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3966931?u=dbfb6fe980e4fd4d9b109d66b8b78700f7af59dc&v=4&size=48)](/atx)[atx](https://github.com/atx)opened [on Jul 1, 2018](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3234#issue-337301713)

The mitmweb interface does not seem to include protection against DNS rebinding. This could be exploited by a malicious website to either access the sniffed data or run arbitrary Python scripts on the filesystem by setting the `scripts` config option.

I have hacked together a PoC [here](http://arya.atx.name/mmp.html) (nothing really special to be seen though).

This PR attempts to guard mitmweb against DNS rebinding attacks.

See also:

* [mitmweb isn't protected against DNS rebinding #3234](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3234)
* <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide/security.html#dns-rebinding>

[@atx](https://github.com/atx): My understanding is that enforcing the hostname to match `'(localhost|\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)'` should effectively mitigate this while still enabling users to access mitmweb from other hosts if they so desire. Do you see errors in my thinking?

In the long term we should probably adopt a jupyter-style solution, but it's more important to get this fixed quickly now.

Sorry, something went wrong.
