Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14337:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a signed integer overflow within the `CHECK` macro in `mrbgems/mruby-sprintf/src/sprintf.c`, specifically in the `bsize*=2` operation. This overflow leads to a negative value for `bsiz`, which is subsequently passed to the `mrb_str_resize` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The multiplication `bsiz*=2` can result in a negative value due to integer overflow.
*   **Missing Length Check:** The `mrb_str_resize` function does not properly check for negative lengths and proceeds to set the string length to this negative value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Out-of-bounds memory access:**  The negative length passed to `mrb_str_resize` allows setting the string length to a large (or negative which is then treated as large due to how memory is accessed) value. Subsequent operations that access the string data using this out-of-bounds length will lead to out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds access can cause a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly demonstrated, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts like arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control the memory access patterns.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted format string to the `sprintf` function, which causes the internal buffer resizing logic to overflow and call `mrb_str_resize` with a negative length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `sprintf` function within a vulnerable mruby application. This means they need the ability to execute ruby code or influence the program's inputs that use `sprintf`.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is triggered within `mrb_str_format` in `mrbgems/mruby-sprintf/src/sprintf.c`.
* The vulnerability exists because the compiler can optimize out the overflow check (`if (bsiz < 0) mrb_raise(...);`) due to undefined behavior of signed integer overflows according to the C standard.
* The `mrb_str_resize` function in `src/string.c` does not validate the `len` argument which may be negative.

This vulnerability is present in mruby versions prior to the fix.
