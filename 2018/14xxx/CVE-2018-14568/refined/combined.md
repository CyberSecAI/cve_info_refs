stream: support RST getting lost/ignored

```
In case of a valid RST on a SYN, the state is switched to 'TCP_CLOSED'.
However, the target of the RST may not have received it, or may not
have accepted it. Also, the RST may have been injected, so the supposed
sender may not actually be aware of the RST that was sent in it's name.

In this case the previous behavior was to switch the state to CLOSED and
accept no further TCP updates or stream reassembly.

This patch changes this. It still switches the state to CLOSED, as this
is by far the most likely to be correct. However, it will reconsider
the state if the receiver continues to talk.

To do this on each state change the previous state will be recorded in
TcpSession::pstate. If a non-RST packet is received after a RST, this
TcpSession::pstate is used to try to continue the conversation.

If the (supposed) sender of the RST is also continueing the conversation
as normal, it's highly likely it didn't send the RST. In this case
a stream event is generated.

Ticket: [#2501](https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/2501)

### Suricata stops inspecting TCP stream if a TCP RST was met

Added by [ajaxtpm ajaxtpm](/users/792) [over 6 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2018-05-03 "05/03/2018 02:22 PM") ago.

**Description**

Windows clients are able to process TCP data even if they arrived shortly after TCP RST packet so the current behaviour is logical but open door for IDS bypasses
PoC pcap attached.
The following signatures should alert on HTTP request and answer:

alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN NO\_STREAM RULE"; flow: no\_stream; content: "been"; sid: 1; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN ONLY\_STREAM RULE"; flow: only\_stream; content: "been"; sid: 2; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 3; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET NO\_STREAM RULE"; flow: no\_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 4; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET ONLY\_STREAM RULE"; flow: only\_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 5; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP GET RULE"; content: "GET"; sid: 6; )

but only sid 1 and 4 alerts.

Setting it to private due to bypass issue unless Victor thinks it's not that bad :)

Thanks for reporting with a .pcap attached

Out of curiosity - from your tests/observations - is that with any windows client OS or specific to a windows OS version?

Hi Peter,

Windows 7/8/10 behave the same. I think it works with any windows OS

## inject\_server: Proof-Of-Concept for CVE-2018-6794.

If as a server side you break a normal TCP 3 way handshake packets order and inject some response data before 3whs is complete then data still will be received by the client but some IDS engines may skip content checks on that.

```
Client    ->  [SYN] [Seq=0 Ack=0]           ->  Evil Server     # Client starts a TCP 3-way handshake
Client    <-  [SYN, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack=1]      <-  Evil Server     # Server responses as it should, but ...
Client    <-  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=1]      <-  Evil Server     # It sends HTTP response before the 3whs is completed
Client    <-  [FIN, ACK] [Seq=83 Ack=1]     <-  Evil Server     # Moreover it finishes TCP session
Client    ->  [ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=84]          ->  Evil Server     # Client finishes TCP 3whs by sending ACK packet and confirms data from server
Client    ->  [PSH, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack= 4]     ->  Evil Server     # Then it sends a HTTP GET request as nothing wrong happened

```

Suricata IDS < 4.0.4 is prone to this issue: HTTP or Stream-TCP signatures will not alert on the injected content.
We do not see any alerts on an evil http response data if we apply the following signatures against PoC network traffic

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN NO_STREAM RULE"; flow: no_stream; content: "been"; sid: 1; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN ONLY_STREAM RULE"; flow: only_stream; content: "been"; sid: 2; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 3; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET NO_STREAM RULE"; flow: no_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 4; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET ONLY_STREAM RULE"; flow: only_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 5; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP GET RULE"; content: "GET"; sid: 6; )

```

## rst\_server: Proof-Of-Concept for CVE-2018-14568.

Windows clients are able to process TCP data even if they arrived shortly after TCP RST packet. Some IDSes process this correctly and try to match data after RST but some stops inpecting TCP stream after RST was received.

```
Client    ->  [SYN] [Seq=0 Ack=0]           ->  Evil Server     # Client starts a TCP 3-way handshake
Client    <-  [RST, ACK] [Seq=0x0 Ack=1]    <-  Evil Server     # Server responses with TCP RST
Client    <-  [SYN, ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=1]      <-  Evil Server     # And SYN-ACK shortly after RST
           ... 3whs continues ...

```

Suricata IDS is still prone to this issue: HTTP or Stream-TCP signatures will not alert on this TCP session.

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN NO_STREAM RULE"; flow: no_stream; content: "been"; sid: 1; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP BEEN ONLY_STREAM RULE"; flow: only_stream; content: "been"; sid: 2; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 3; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET NO_STREAM RULE"; flow: no_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 4; )
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP GET ONLY_STREAM RULE"; flow: only_stream; content: "GET"; sid: 5; )
alert http any any -> any any (msg: "HTTP GET RULE"; content: "GET"; sid: 6; )

05/03/2018-19:13:43.270632  [**] [1:4:0] TCP GET NO_STREAM RULE [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {TCP} 192.168.235.1:53434 -> 192.168.235.101:80

```

## icmp\_server: Proof-Of-Concept for CVE-2016-10728.

Server should reply with ICMP message type "Destination Unreachable" code "Port Unreachable" if a UDP packet was sent to a closed UDP port. IDS may interpret ICMP Unreachable answers on the same way as TCP RST packets and stop or limit traffic inspection of this UDP stream. If a normal UDP answer follows the ICMP message then attacker bypasses UDP checks of traffic from his server. Note that normal clients close connections if ICMP Dest. Unreachable was received so we interchange IP addresses and UDP ports in ICMP message's attached UDP so client does not accept such ICMP message but IDS does.

```
Client    ->  [UDP Req]                  ->  Evil Server     # Client starts UDP session by sending a packet
Client    <-  [ICMP] [Type=3, Code=3]    <-  Evil Server     # Server responses with *improved* ICMP Destination Unreachable first
Client    <-  [UDP Resp]                 <-  Evil Server     # And with UDP answer as usual

```

Suricata IDS < 3.1.2 is prone to this issue: UDP signatures will not match on packets from Evil Server.

```
alert udp any any -> any any (msg: "UDP BEEN RULE"; content: "been"; sid: 1; )
alert udp any any -> any any (msg: "UDP HELLO RULE"; content: "hello"; sid: 2; )

05/03/2018-03:44:11.016635  [**] [1:2:0] UDP HELLO RULE [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {UDP} 192.168.235.100:46599 -> 192.168.235.101:80

```

This techniques may be applied for other Intrusion Detection or Network Monitoring tools and systems.
