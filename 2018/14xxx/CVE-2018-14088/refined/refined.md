Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Integer overflow in the `withdrawToFounders` function of a smart contract.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The `withdrawToFounders` function multiplies the input `amount` by a large constant (`1000000000000000`) without proper overflow checks.
*   This multiplication can lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller-than-expected `amount_to_withdraw` value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker (the contract owner in this case) can manipulate the `amount` input to trigger an integer overflow.
*   The resulting smaller `amount_to_withdraw` value can cause the contract to send less ETH to the founder addresses than intended.
*   The contract owner can potentially keep the excess funds.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract.
*   The attacker calls the `withdrawToFounders` function with a large `amount` value designed to cause an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be the owner of the smart contract, as the `withdrawToFounders` function has an `onlyOwner` modifier.

**More Detail than the CVE Description**

Yes, the content provides more details than a basic CVE description would:

*   It shows the specific code snippet with the vulnerable function.
*   It explains exactly how the overflow occurs through multiplication of a large number.
*   It specifies the impact of the vulnerability (incorrect amount withdrawn and potential theft).
*   It defines the exact conditions needed for exploitation (contract owner with a large input).
