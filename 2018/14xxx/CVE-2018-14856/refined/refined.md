{
  "CVE-2018-14856": {
    "root_cause": "The `dhd_bus_flow_ring_create_response` function uses an attacker-controlled `flowid` to index into the `flow_ring_table` without proper validation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds array access"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary kernel memory corruption by zeroing out a byte, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation or a denial of service. The issue is that if `flowid` is out of bounds, the code can still cause a crash due to dereferencing invalid memory and/or corrupting kernel structures.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with control over the Wi-Fi SoC can send a malicious message to trigger the vulnerability via the `dhd_prot_process_flow_ring_create_response` function, which then calls `dhd_bus_flow_ring_create_response`.",

  "CVE-2018-14854": {
    "root_cause": "The `dhd_bus_flow_ring_delete_response` function uses an attacker-controlled `flowid` to index into the `flow_ring_table` without proper validation, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
   "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds array access"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a kernel crash due to a NULL pointer dereference in the `dhd_bus_clean_flow_ring` function, leading to a denial of service. If `flowid` is out of bounds, it will dereference invalid memory resulting in a kernel crash. Depending on the specific out-of-bounds memory accessed, the crash may or may not occur, but memory corruption could happen.",
