Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-14481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the OSclass 3.7.4 application. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into various parts of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of reflected XSS vulnerabilities are identified in various admin panel URLs. These occur when user-supplied input within the URL (GET parameters) is directly reflected in the HTML output without proper sanitization.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** One instance of stored XSS is found. This occurs when malicious input is saved within the application and then rendered to other users without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript code, which, when clicked by an authenticated admin user, will execute the script within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Defacement of the admin panel
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject a malicious script through a vulnerable field. This script will be stored in the application and will execute in the browsers of any admin user who views the affected part of the application. This could lead to:
    *   Widespread compromise of admin accounts
    *   Persistent malicious activity

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code embedded within GET parameters. The victim (admin user) needs to be tricked into clicking these malicious URLs.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attack vector involves submitting malicious code within a POST request to the `/oc-admin/index.php?page=settings` URL. This code will be saved to the database, and triggered upon page loads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For both reflected and stored XSS, the attacker does not require prior access to the application.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a victim (admin user) into clicking the malicious link.
*  **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to find a vulnerable field to inject the payload through a POST request.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Multiple URLs are listed, each with a specific vulnerable GET parameter (`iDisplayLength` and `nsextt`). The payload injected in `iDisplayLength` is  `x%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E=&iDisplayLength=1`. The payload injected in `nsextt` is `'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(0x005A81)</scRipt>`.
*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerable parameter is `language` which accepts the payload  `'+alert(0x007BDC)+'`

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory states that the vulnerabilities were discovered by Zekvan Arslan using the Invicti Web Application Security Scanner.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed by the vendor.
*   The Invicti advisory reference for this issue is NS-18-029.
