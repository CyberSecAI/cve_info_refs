Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in a SQL injection flaw within the `content://wappush` content provider of the `com.android.provider.telephony` package on certain Android devices. This package stores sensitive information such as calls, contacts, and SMS messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `content://wappush` content provider is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SMS Leakage:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass the Android permission model and extract SMS messages without having the `READ_SMS` permission. This could expose sensitive information such as activation codes and other personal messages.
- **Privacy Breach:** The vulnerability allows applications with only `INTERNET` permission to access SMS data, leading to significant privacy breaches.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to SMS could enable further malicious activities, such as account hijacking and identity theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Drozer Framework:** The vulnerability was discovered and exploited using the Drozer framework, which enables security assessments of Android devices and applications.
- **Malicious Application:** An attacker could create a malicious Android app that exploits this vulnerability to steal SMS messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs a malicious application installed on the target device. This application does not need the `READ_SMS` permission, only internet access.
- **Drozer agent:** An attacker can use the Drozer agent to exploit the SQL injection via the `content://wappush` provider.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Provider:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `content://wappush` content provider.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker used the following command to exploit the vulnerability:
  `run app.provider.query content://wappush --projection "* from 'SMS' LIMIT 2";--`
- This command injects SQL code into the query, enabling the attacker to retrieve data from the SMS table.

**Affected Devices:**
- Infinix X571 (Android 7)
- Lenovo A7020 (Android 6)
- Potentially other devices using similar custom ROMs
