{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "During live migration of OpenStack instances, there is a brief period where the instance's ports are untagged, making them act as trunk ports. If a port is administratively down during migration, it will remain untagged indefinitely.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Untagged ports on the integration bridge acting as trunk ports.",
      "Insufficient port isolation during live migration.",
       "OVS agent does not properly handle ports without a VLAN tag"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to a private network can eavesdrop on traffic from other private networks on the same compute node. They can also send traffic to these other networks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Live migration of an instance.",
        "Resizing an instance",
        "Setting a port administratively down"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires access to an instance on a shared compute node and the ability to set its port administratively down. The attacker also needs to wait for an administrator-initiated live migration or trigger a resize operation."

  "additional_details": {
     "fixes": [
        "Neutron's port_dead function now always sets the dead tag on new unbound ports.",
        "OS-VIF now enforces a dead tag for new OVS ports",
        "Neutron's drop rule for dead VLAN is set to the highest priority.",
        "Nova delegates OVS port plugging to os-vif to ensure initial port creation with the dead tag"

   "mitigation": "Setting the port as administratively down extends the vulnerable window indefinitely. Otherwise, the window is very small.",
