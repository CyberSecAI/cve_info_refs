{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `batchTransfer` function.",
      "Weaknesses": "The `batchTransfer` function calculates the total transfer amount by multiplying the number of receivers by the transfer value (`amount = cnt * _value`). This multiplication can result in an integer overflow, bypassing the balance check and allowing an attacker to transfer a much larger amount of tokens than they actually own.",
      "Impact": "An attacker can exploit the integer overflow to mint tokens without the owner's awareness and manipulate the balance of other users, potentially gaining a large number of tokens and arbitrarily altering balances.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `batchTransfer` function with a large number of receivers and/or a large transfer value. Specifically, by providing a number of receivers and a value that, when multiplied, causes an integer overflow.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have at least one address and be able to call the `batchTransfer` function. They do not need any special privileges or permissions."
    },
      {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `multipleTransfer` function.",
      "Weaknesses": "The `multipleTransfer` function calculates the total transfer amount by multiplying the number of recipients by the transfer value (`_value * _to.length`). This multiplication can result in an integer overflow, leading to insufficient funds being deducted from the senderâ€™s balance.",
        "Impact": "An attacker can exploit the integer overflow to transfer tokens to multiple addresses without actually having sufficient balance, effectively creating new tokens and manipulating the balances of other users.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `multipleTransfer` function with a large number of recipients and/or a large transfer value. Specifically, by providing a number of recipients and a value that, when multiplied, causes an integer overflow.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have at least one address and be able to call the `multipleTransfer` function. They do not need any special privileges or permissions."
