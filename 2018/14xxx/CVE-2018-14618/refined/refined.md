Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2018-14618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash` function within libcurl's NTLM authentication code. This function calculates the size of a temporary storage area by multiplying the password length by two. On 32-bit systems, if the password length is greater than 2GB, the multiplication results in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller buffer allocation than needed.
*   Subsequently, when the code iterates through the password to generate the output, it writes beyond the boundaries of the allocated (too small) buffer, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of password length by two can result in an integer overflow, particularly on 32-bit systems where the maximum size_t is smaller, if the password length exceeds 2GB.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The allocated buffer is too small due to the integer overflow, leading to a heap buffer overflow during output generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code by controlling the contents written past the boundaries of the allocated heap memory.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The overflow can also lead to crashes of the application or service using the vulnerable libcurl library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious HTTP server which requires NTLM authentication and can provide a password of sufficient length which triggers the overflow on the vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the server side of an NTLM authentication exchange with a vulnerable client. They can exploit the overflow by sending NTLM negotiation messages containing very large password lengths.
*   The vulnerability is limited to 32-bit systems.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug was introduced in libcurl in April 2006.
*   The vulnerability is present in libcurl versions 7.15.4 to 7.61.0, inclusive.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in libcurl version 7.61.1.
*   The vulnerability is similar to a previously identified vulnerability, CVE-2017-8816, which also involves an integer overflow in the NTLM authentication process.
