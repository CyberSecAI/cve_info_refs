1.  **Vulnerability:** CVE-2018-14632
2.  **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `json-patch` library used by OpenShift Container Platform. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when patching an OpenShift object using the `oc patch` command with a JSON payload. This vulnerability occurs due to a flaw in how the library processes the JSON patch, leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.
3.  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds write in `json-patch` library.
    *   Improper validation of input data during JSON patch processing.
4.  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) of the OpenShift master API service, which is critical for cluster management. Successful exploitation crashes the master API service, disrupting cluster management and potentially all the services running on the cluster..
5.  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the `oc patch` functionality using a specially crafted JSON payload.
6.  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires access to the OpenShift cluster and the ability to execute `oc patch` commands.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the OpenShift API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.x.
*   The issue was addressed by fixing the underlying `json-patch` library and updating OpenShift Container Platform.
*   A multi-master OpenShift Container Platform cluster provides increased resilience but a sustained attack would still have a significant impact.
*   The fix was backported to multiple OpenShift versions, including 3.6, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
*   The fix included updated RPM packages and container images.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a authenticated user sending a malformed JSON document with the oc patch command.
