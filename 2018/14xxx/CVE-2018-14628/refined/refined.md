    "summary": "CVE-2018-14628 is an information leak vulnerability in Samba's LDAP server, affecting versions 4.0.0 and later when used as an Active Directory Domain Controller. The vulnerability stems from missing access control checks when retrieving deleted object tombstones, allowing authenticated, unprivileged users to access the names and preserved attributes of deleted objects via the LDAP_SERVER_SHOW_DELETED_OID control. Patches require a manual step to fix existing domains by running samba-tool dbcheck, as the patch only secures new domain provisions. The vulnerability allows disclosure of object attributes."
