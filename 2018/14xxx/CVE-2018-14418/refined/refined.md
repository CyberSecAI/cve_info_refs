Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the MSVOD V10 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cid` parameter of the `/images/lists` endpoint, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the database, including database name, username, and version.
*   **Potential Data Modification:**  The provided payload shows data exfiltration, but the same vulnerability could be used for data modification or deletion if the database user has necessary privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/images/lists` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The `cid` parameter is the injection point, where SQL code is inserted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application server.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** Understanding how to send HTTP GET requests and manipulate parameters is required.
*   **SQL Knowledge:**  Knowledge of SQL syntax is necessary to craft effective payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `cid` parameter in `/images/lists`
*   **Payload Example:**
    `/images/lists?cid=13%20)%20ORDER%20BY%201%20desc,extractvalue(rand(),concat(0x7c,database(),0x7c,user(),0x7c,@@version))%20desc%20--%20`
* This payload uses a combination of techniques:
    *  `13%20)%20ORDER%20BY%201%20desc`: This likely attempts to close a SQL statement and add a benign `ORDER BY` clause.
    *  `extractvalue(rand(),concat(0x7c,database(),0x7c,user(),0x7c,@@version))`: This is the main injection, using `extractvalue` and `concat` to extract database information.
    *  `desc%20--%20`: This appends `desc` to the ordering and comment out the rest of the query, effectively avoiding syntax errors.
