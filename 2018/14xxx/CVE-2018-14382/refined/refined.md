  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the 'url' parameter in the redirect functionality.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the redirect URL, which will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the 'url' parameter and tricks a user into clicking this crafted URL. When the victim visits the crafted URL, the server will redirect them using the unsanitized 'url' parameter, causing the JavaScript code to execute within the victim's browser."
