The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `rejucms_v2.1`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is stored in the database. Specifically, the `content` parameter from the message board form (`book.php`) is inserted into the database with only `addslashes()` applied, which is insufficient to prevent XSS.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The `addslashes()` function is used, but it is not sufficient to prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the message board. When an administrator views the message board entries, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the message board form located at `/WWW/rejucms_v2.1/book.php`. An attacker submits a crafted message containing malicious JavaScript code within the `content` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to submit data to the message board form (`/WWW/rejucms_v2.1/book.php`). The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the message board entries in the admin panel (`/WWW/rejucm_v2.1/admin/cms_book.php`).

The content also provides a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using a POST request.
The suggested repair method is to use `htmlspecialchars(addslashes($variable))` to properly sanitize the input.
