  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2018-14299",
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of Line annotations. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition within the processing of Line annotations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker must create a specially crafted PDF document and lure a user into opening it to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Additional notes": "The content provides more details about the vulnerability than the official CVE description, including the affected component (Line annotations) and the cause (pointer reuse after being freed). It also notes that user interaction is required and describes the vulnerability's impact as arbitrary code execution within the current process's context."
