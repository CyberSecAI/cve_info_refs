{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `WebPImage::decodeChunks` function within the `webpimage.cpp` file of the Exiv2 library.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer over-read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a specially crafted image file that triggers the buffer over-read.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted WebP image file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WebP image file to be processed by the vulnerable application using the Exiv2 library."
