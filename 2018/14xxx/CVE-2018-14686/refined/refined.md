Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before storing it in the database and subsequently displaying it on the website. Specifically, the `injCheck` function used for input validation only filters for SQL injection-related keywords, neglecting to filter for characters that can be used to inject HTML/JavaScript code (e.g., `<`, `>`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores user-supplied input (specifically `b_name`, `b_title`, and `b_content`) directly into the database without proper sanitization. When this data is later retrieved and displayed on the `/www/xycms_v1.7/system/edit_book.php` page, the unsanitized input containing malicious JavaScript is executed in the user's browser. This results in a stored XSS vulnerability.
*  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `injCheck` function only checks for SQL injection keywords, failing to address XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page.
*   **Data Theft:** Through malicious scripts, an attacker could steal user cookies or session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or content of the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or distribute malware.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could create fake login pages or other content to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/xycms_v1.7/add_do.php`. The request includes malicious JavaScript payload within the parameters `b_name`, `b_title`, and `b_content`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Understanding of Application Workflow:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`add_do.php`) and the parameters to submit.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location (Backend):** `/www/xycms_v1.7/system/edit_book.php` - where the unsanitized data is displayed.
*   **Vulnerable Code Location (Input Processing):** `/www/xycms_v1.7/add_do.php` - where the unsanitized data is stored in the database.
*   **Bypass of Input Validation:** The `injCheck` function in `/www/xycms_v1.7/Libs/Function/fun.php` only filters for SQL injection, not for XSS.
*  **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The content includes a detailed HTTP POST request as a PoC.
