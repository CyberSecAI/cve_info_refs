The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14860.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper sanitization of dynamic user expressions within the Odoo "safe eval" sandbox. The sandbox environment was not sufficiently sanitized, allowing an attacker to escape it using crafted expressions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insufficiently sanitized "safe eval" sandbox. Allows for escaping the sandbox environment via crafted dynamic expressions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution as the user running the Odoo service.
- Launching system commands with access to local files and services.
- Potential access to sensitive information such as passwords, leading to elevated privileges on the hosting machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network exploitable.
- Requires a privileged user account (e.g., administrator) on an Odoo database.
- Attackers craft special code expressions targeted at escaping the sandbox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote network access.
- Administrator or privileged user account on a vulnerable Odoo installation.

**Additional details:**
The advisory specifies that systems hosting Odoo databases for untrusted users (e.g., SaaS platforms) are particularly at risk. No workaround is available but systems without privileged access to untrusted users are not vulnerable. Patches are provided for Odoo versions 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0, both community and enterprise editions, with specific commit hashes referenced for each version.
