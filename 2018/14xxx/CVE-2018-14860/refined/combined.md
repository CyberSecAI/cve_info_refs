## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32505#issue-430456607)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-5

Improper sanitization of dynamic user expressions in Odoo Community 11.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 and earlier allows authenticated privileged users to escape from the dynamic expression sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the hosting system.

**Affects**: Odoo 11.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Odoo Framework

**Credits**: <Undisclosed>

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14859](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14859)

## I. Background

Odoo includes a sandbox for interpreting dynamic business logic components,

such as the definition of workflows, automated actions, or the dynamic

expressions used within report templates.

The mechanism behind this sandbox is called 'safe eval' and keeps the system

safe while allowing advanced customizations. Its role is to execute

user-provided Odoo business logic, while preventing any undesired

effects on the data or the hosting platform - such as could be caused

by accident or by malicious users.

In order to be allowed to customize any of these dynamic business logic

components, one must usually be an administrator of an Odoo database,

or have otherwise received elevated privileges.

## II. Problem Description

The default 'safe eval' sandbox environment was not sufficiently sanitized,

so an attacker with sufficient privileges might be able to escape the sandbox

through the use of specially crafted dynamic expressions.

Systems who host Odoo databases for untrusted users are particularly at risk,

(e.g. SaaS platforms), as they typically allow users to become administrators

of their own Odoo database. This is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.

## III. Impact

Access Vector: Network exploitable

Access Complexity: Medium

**Authentication**: Privileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Critical :: 9.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Malicious users with access to an administrator account on an Odoo database

might craft special code expressions specifically targeted at escaping

the sandbox protection.

This could in turn be used to execute arbitrary code as the user running

the Odoo service, to launch system commands with access to local files and

local services.

Files and environments accessed in this manner may contain sensitive

information such as passwords that could also allow the user to gain elevated

privileges on the hosting machine itself, in addition to being able to run

commands.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires remote network access and

administrator (or privileged) account on a database hosted on a vulnerable

Odoo installation.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems that do not provide administrator

or otherwise privileged access to untrusted users are not vulnerable.

All Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [779ceac](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/779ceac97309fd69086446bc14e6d613aeb9bbdd)
* 10.0: [ef017ab](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/ef017ab1ab7bc5988ad30ab92a445079e245cf03)
* 11.0: [21bb14d](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/21bb14d17764f16ca2727622d7892d38104e2ec3)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.
