Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-14387:

**CVE-2018-14387: Session Fixation Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not invalidate the existing session ID before authenticating a user. It reuses the existing session ID instead of creating a new one upon successful login.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is session fixation. An attacker can set a session ID on a victim's browser. Then, the attacker can induce the victim to log in with that pre-set session ID, allowing the attacker to use that session ID to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account after successful authentication.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** A successful attack allows the attacker to gain complete access to the victim's account. The attacker can perform any actions the user can perform.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker initiates a session and obtains a session ID, then tricks the victim into using that session ID by visiting the website through a malicious link, for example.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to set the session ID on the victim's browser, or trick the victim into using a pre-defined session ID.
    *   No special privileges are required on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a GitHub issue (#64) that describes the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it with before and after login screenshots to demonstrate the reused session.
*   The content explicitly states that "When authenticating a user, it doesnâ€™t assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID."
