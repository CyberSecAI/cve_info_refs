# A integer overflow vulnerability in wifipacp.cpp #182

## Description

[![@ZIllR0](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30304967?v=4&size=48)](/ZIllR0)[ZIllR0](https://github.com/ZIllR0)opened [on Aug 2, 2018](https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow/issues/182#issue-347070689)

There is a overflow vulnerability in function `handle_prism` while handle wifipacp's caplen.

```
void WifiPacket::handle_prism(const u_char *pc, size_t len)
{
    ....
    cbs->HandlePrism( *this, &hdr, pc + 144, len - 144);
}

```

if the caplen < 144, we can cause a integer overflow vulnerability in function `handle_80211`, which will result in a out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory(or just a ddos).

```

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Binary packages built by this source

[tcpflow](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/tcpflow):
TCP flow recorder

tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP

 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient

 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a

 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the

 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow

 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a

 separate file for later analysis.

 .

 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct

 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.

 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows

 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.

 .

 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore

 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like

 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured

 with 'tcpdump -w'.

# USN-3955-1: tcpflow vulnerabilities

24 April 2019

tcpflow could be made to crash or expose sensitive information over the network
if it opened a specially crafted file or received specially crafted network
traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [tcpflow](/security/cves?package=tcpflow) - TCP flow recorder

## Details

It was discovered that tcpflow incorrectly handled certain malformed network

packets. A remote attacker could send these packets to a target system, causing

tcpflow to crash or possibly disclose sensitive information.
