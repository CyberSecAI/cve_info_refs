Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2018-14655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the way Keycloak handles the `response_mode=form_post` parameter during the authentication process. Specifically, the `state` parameter within the authentication URL is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of sanitization of the `state` parameter allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the authentication URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **XSS Attack:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser upon successful login. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious authentication URL with a specifically crafted `state` parameter containing JavaScript code.
- A user would need to be tricked into accessing the malicious URL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to construct the malicious authentication URL and have the victim user access it.
- No specific access or privileges to the target system are necessary prior to exploiting this vulnerability, other than knowledge of the vulnerable system and ability to craft a URL to it.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
