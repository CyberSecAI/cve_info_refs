{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Subsonic application's music tags setting form is vulnerable to stored XSS due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the music tags settings form, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they visit the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, privilege escalation (if an admin is targeted) and other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/dwr/call/plaincall/tagService.setTags.dwr` endpoint with a malicious JavaScript payload injected in the `c0-param2`, `c0-param3`, and `c0-param4` parameters."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with tag modification permissions to exploit this vulnerability. No admin access is required to inject the XSS payload initially, but gaining admin access by targetting an admin user is an impact of the vulnerability."
