Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `_ykpiv_fetch_object()` function within the `lib/ykpiv.c` file of the Yubico PIV tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The `memmove()` function uses a length value obtained from the APDU data. This length isn't validated to ensure it remains within the bounds of the received data buffer. Consequently, `memmove()` can potentially read data from memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read data from arbitrary memory locations, though the content implies it's not controllable, which is why this is rated as a low severity. The confidentiality of data could be impacted, but the integrity or availability is not.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) response received by the Yubico PIV tool.
- This requires the attacker to use a malicious device that pretends to be a YubiKey and sends the crafted APDU response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to a computer running the vulnerable Yubico PIV Tool, YubiKey PIV Manager or YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver.
- The attacker needs a custom-made, malicious USB device masquerading as a YubiKey that can send crafted APDU responses to trigger the vulnerability.
- No privileges are needed beyond access to the host computer, but they're needed to load a malicious device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in `libykpiv` version 1.5.0 and was fixed in version 1.6.0.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the tool when it interacts with a malicious device, and it is not possible to trigger it with a genuine YubiKey.
- The advisory notes that X41 did not perform a full test or audit of the software.
- The vendor, Yubico, released patches for the Yubico PIV Tool, YubiKey PIV Manager, and YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver.
- While the vulnerability is rated as low, the advisory notes there is a high severity vulnerability with CVE-2018-14779 that can result in remote code execution.
