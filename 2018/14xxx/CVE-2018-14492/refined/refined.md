The provided content details a buffer overflow vulnerability in Tenda routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `httpd` web server of Tenda routers.
- When handling `limitSpeed` and `limitSpeedup` parameters from a POST request, the values are directly formatted using `sprintf` into a local stack variable. This leads to a buffer overflow because no bounds checking occurs and the input can exceed the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in the `httpd` web server.
- Lack of input validation and bounds checking during the usage of `sprintf`.
- Direct manipulation of the stack memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The buffer overflow overwrites the function's return address.
- It leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). Arbitrary code execution may be possible, but it is not explicitly stated here.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a crafted POST request to the router's web server, including overly long values for the `limitSpeed` and/or `limitSpeedup` parameters.
- The vulnerability is located in the httpd web server of the routers
- The attacker must have a position on the network where they can access the router's web server interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web server.
- Network connectivity to the vulnerable router.
