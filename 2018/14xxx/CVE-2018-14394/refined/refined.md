Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14394:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A division-by-zero error occurs in the `libavformat/movenc.c` file when processing a crafted Waveform audio file. The vulnerability arises due to a missing check of the input sample count. If the number of samples in a chunk is less than 1, the code attempts a division by `samples_in_chunk` which results in a division by zero.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero error

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash). The division by zero error leads to an application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted Waveform audio file. The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted Waveform audio file where input packet contains no samples.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted Waveform audio file to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit fixes the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the number of samples in a chunk is greater than or equal to 1, which prevents the division by zero.
- The vulnerability was found by CHEN HONGXU.
- Debian LTS has issued a security advisory (DLA 1630-1) including this CVE.
