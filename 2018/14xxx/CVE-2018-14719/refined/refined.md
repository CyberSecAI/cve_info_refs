  "CVE-2018-14719": {
    "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7, 2.8.11.3, and 2.7.9.5 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes from polymorphic deserialization.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of polymorphic deserialization by jackson-databind, specifically the failure to block certain classes, like `blaze-ds-opt` and `blaze-ds-core`, during deserialization. This allows an attacker to control the classes that are instantiated which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper polymorphic deserialization",
      "Arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Network-based attacks: By sending malicious JSON data with crafted class information to a vulnerable server"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send crafted JSON messages to a service utilizing the vulnerable jackson-databind library.",
      "No user interaction or specific privileges required"
    ],
     "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks during polymorphic deserialization.",
           "Successful exploitation does not require user interaction."
