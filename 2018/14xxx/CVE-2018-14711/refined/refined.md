The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-14711, found in ASUS routers running ASUSWRT firmware.

**CVE-2018-14711: Cross-Site Request Forgery in appGet.cgi**

*   **Root Cause:** The `/appGet.cgi` endpoint lacks any CSRF protection.
*   **Weakness:** Missing CSRF protection allows attackers to craft malicious links that, when clicked by an authenticated user, will execute state-changing requests on the router.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate router settings by tricking users into clicking a malicious link, such as changing system locales.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that forces the user's browser to send a request to the router, performing a function on the router.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the user to be logged into the router's web interface and convince them to click a malicious link. The attacker does not require prior authentication to the router to launch the attack, only the targeted user must be authenticated.
