A nalyze JavaScript files during your hunting process To analyze JavaScript files during your hunting process, you can use the following one-liner to extract all JavaScript files from a specific domain. Then, you can use the 'grep' command to filter and display only sensitive information like authentication tokens. Required tools for this process include: -A command-line interface. -A tool for recursively extracting JavaScript files from a domain. -The 'grep' command for pattern matching and extraction of sensitive data such as authentication tokens. -subfinder - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder -httpx - https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx -waybackurls - https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls MAIN ONELINER:  subfinder -d domain.com | httpx -mc 200 | tee subdomains.txt && cat subdomains.txt | waybackurls | httpx -mc 200 | grep .js | tee js.txt GREP ONELINER FOR EXTRACTING TOKENS, AUTH,... : cat js.txt | grep -r -E “aws\_access\_key|aws\_secret\_k...

[July 12, 2022](https://neetech18.blogspot.com/2022/07/bypass-csrf-token-verification.html "permanent link")

 A few ways to Bypass CSRF-Token Verification: 1. Use a blank CSRF token value. 2. Completely remove the CSRF token parameter value from the request. 3. Use any random CSRF Token of the same length. 4. Create another user account, copy its CSRF Token value and use it in the victim's account. 5. Try to decode the CSRF Token and check if it is encoded with algorithms like Base64, If yes it can be generated for other users. 6. Change request method i.e. from POST to GET. There is a possibility that the action gets initiated in both GET and POST method and it doesn't require a token in case of GET Method. Adding: Try bypassing with referrer based. Check whether CSRF tokens are expired properly. -->Old CSRF token re-use require physical access to the machine in order to exploit also the account should be logged in the time attacker access the device. It's a very low severity.

LFI-LFD-RFI-Path Traversal Local File Inclusion (LFI):  The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a dynamic file inclusion mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation. It also known as that is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. Function that could result in LFI: 1-include () 2-inculde \_once() 3-require () 4-require\_once() Local File Disclosure (LFD):  The same as local file inclusion but it enable be to execute file not only read it . Note: Every LFI can be LFD but every LFD not necessary to be LFI. A local file inclusion vuln means it executes the contents it includes, like PHP's include() function. A local file disclosure vuln discloses the contents of the local file. Reconsider your definition of loc...

**Product:**
===================
Polaris’ Intellect Core Banking, Armor
Module

**Version:**
===================
Affected Version: 9.7.1

**Vulnerability Type:**
==========================
Error Based SQL Injection vulnerability

**CVE Reference:**
==============
 CVE-2018-14874

**Vulnerability Details:**
======================
SQL injection, are common in web
applications. Injection occurs when user-supplied data is sent to an
interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data tricks
the interpreter into executing unintended commands or changing data. The
Intellect Core is and Core Banking software used for manage the core banking
functions. In Armor Module of the Intellect Core, input passed through the parameter
'code' in three pages as 'collaterals/colexe3t.jsp' and
'/references/refsuppu.jsp' and '/references/refbranu.jsp' is not properly
sanitising the input before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to
manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. SQL injection attacks
allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation
issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, destroy the data or
make it otherwise unavailable and escalate his privileges to become
administrator of the database server.
**Note:** This is vulnerable only with authenticated
session.
