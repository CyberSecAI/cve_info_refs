The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14513.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input sanitization on the `form[content]` parameter when submitting feedback through the `/wuzhicms/www/index.php?m=feedback&f=index&v=contact` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML code.
- When an administrator accesses the "Content feedback" section, the injected script is executed, potentially leading to malicious actions. This can include session hijacking, account takeover, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/wuzhicms/www/index.php?m=feedback&f=index&v=contact` with malicious JavaScript code within the `form[content]` parameter.
- The injected script is stored in the system.
- When an administrator views the feedback in the "Content feedback" section, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific user privileges are required to inject the malicious payload initially, but administrator access to the feedback module is required to trigger the stored XSS.
