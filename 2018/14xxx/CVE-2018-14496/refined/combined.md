# [What is Vulnerability Coordination?](/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4718642)

* Created by  [Garret Wassermann](/confluence/display/~gwassermann), last modified on [2016-06-16](/confluence/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=4718642&selectedPageVersions=7&selectedPageVersions=8 "Show changes")

# What is Vulnerability Coordination?

Coordination is defined by [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordination) as:

> the process of organizing people or groups so that they work together properly and well

Vulnerability Coordination is the process by which multiple stakeholders in a software vulnerability work together to analyze and address a vulnerability with the goal of eventually disclosing to the public the existence of the vulnerability and guidance on how to mitigate or fix the vulnerability.

Vulnerabilities are difficult to define, but a vulnerability may be thought of as a flaw in software or hardware components that allows an attacker to perform actions that wouldn't normally be allowed. The impact of such vulnerabilities varies greatly, from being able to learn someone's private email address, to taking control of a computer, to causing physical damage and bodily injury.

The stakeholders vary on a case by case basis, but typically include:

* The reporter of the vulnerability
* The vendor of the component that contains the vulnerability
* Vendors that utilize the component containing the vulnerability in their own products ("downstream vendors")
* The CERT/CC, US-CERT, or other 3rd party organization, if the vulnerability was reported to the 3rd party
* The general public / consumers who purchase products containing the vulnerable component

The CERT/CC's role in coordination is to coordinate these stakeholders, making sure the issue is addressed accordingly and the correct information reaches the public.

# What is Vulnerability Disclosure?

Vulnerability Disclosure is the process by which information about the vulnerability (and advice for mitigating or fixing the vulnerability) are released to consumers of the product, and more generally, the general public at large.

There is no specific way to do this; sometimes, vulnerability information is disclosed in a blog post by the reporter of the vulnerability, or emailed to a security mailing list. Sometimes the vendor issues a security advisory to its customers or to the public. In the CERT/CC's case, we publish [Vulnerability Notes](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) on our website, usually in coordination with other simultaneous disclosure methods by the reporter or the vendor.

The amount of information in a disclosure also varies greatly. Some disclosures only warn of a general vulnerability in some specific software; others are more specific and provide actual examples of how to attack the flaw (the examples are called "proof of concept", usually shortened to "PoC").

There is general disagreement on what the "proper" way to disclose a vulnerability is in the security community, as different people and organizations harbor sometimes very strongly differing opinions. As the oldest software vulnerability coordinator in the world, the CERT/CC regularly discusses such issues and opinions with many stakeholders.

# What are the different Vulnerability Disclosure philosophies?

A number of philosophies exist regarding the disclosure of software vulnerabilities to the public. A few of them are listed below:

* **No Disclosure** – When a vulnerability is found, all information about the vulnerability is kept private. Sometimes this is enforced by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Vendors sometimes prefer this scenario to protect secrets, as well as certain researchers that wish to do the same.
* **Limited Disclosure** – When a vulnerability is found, only some information about the vulnerability is disclosed. The goal is typically to slow down reverse engineering and exploit development long enough for a fix to be developed and deployed. This is done by withholding proof of concept code or other technical details of the vulnerability.
* **Full Disclosure** – When a vulnerability is found by a reporter, all information about the vulnerability including proof of concept should be disclosed immediately. The belief is that this disclosure serves the greater good by allowing consumers to be aware of issues in their products, and demand action from vendors, as well as have information available to make more informed purchasing decisions. Security researchers tend to favor this approach. The vendor is typically not informed prior to disclosure, or at least has a very small window (typically < 1 day) to act. Alternately, this type of disclosure may also be performed by the vendor themselves: many open source projects, for example, handle security issues in the open in order to maximize review of the vulnerability and testing of the proposed solution.
* **"Responsible" Disclosure** – When a vulnerability is found by a reporter, the reporter informs the vendor and suggests a timeline for disclosure. The amount of time varies greatly based on the organization. The vendor and reporter typically work together to provide a simultaneous public disclosure after a patch is ready. The disclosure may be Limited Disclosure or Full Disclosure after the timeline has expired. In cases where the vendor and reporter do not agree on a timeline, or the vendor is unresponsive, the reporter may publish anyway at the end of the original proposed timeline. In the CERT/CC's opinion, the term "responsible" is too vague. The word "responsible" tends to draw focus toward "good" and "bad", rather than objectively searching for a way to address a problem that was discovered.
* **Coordinated Disclosure** – Coordinated Disclosure is the CERT/CC's preferred terminology for the older "Responsible Disclosure". Among others, [Microsoft](http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2011/04/19/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-from-philosophy-to-practice.aspx) has advocated for coordinated disclosure. Otherwise, Coordinated Disclosure and Responsible Disclosure are the same thing. Often, you will see Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure abbreviated as CVD.

Another take on this issue is provided at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29).

The CERT/CC believes the Coordinated Disclosure process is the best balance of these competing interests. The public and especially users of the vulnerable component deserve to know issues with their products and how the vendor handles said issues, but at the same time, quickly disclosing such information without review and mitigation only opens the public up to exploit. The best scenario is when everyone can coordinate and work together to protect the public. This coordination can also often be turned into a public relations win for the vendor by quickly addressing the issue.

# What Should I do about Software Security?

[Home](https://www.vdalabs.com/) [Cybersecurity Insights](https://www.vdalabs.com/from-the-experts/) **What Should I do about Software Security?**

[AppSec](https://www.vdalabs.com/category/appsec/)

![](data:image/svg+xml...)
### What do we do?

Companies often ask, “What do I need to do to better protect my software?” And it of course depends on a great many things. That’s where having a trusted partner can help: we help you sift through the details, pentest what you have, and help you engineer a better tomorrow. Here are a few basics to get you thinking about software security.

### Native Apps

Native apps are typically written in C/C++. The big risks are memory corruption, along with the typical design, authentication, and encryption concerns common to all apps. Thus, mitigating control-flow hijacks is top of mind. Buffer overflows, Use-after-frees, and more are the types of vulnerabilities to look out for. Traditional protections include ASLR and DEP to ensure that attackers cannot easily overwrite a pointer and change program flow. Return-oriented programming (ROP) however was the way attackers have gotten around that. Stop-gap solutions like EMET monitored critical APIs to stop ROP… but didn’t fully work. Thus, CFI[2] (control flow integrity) has become the path forward. Microsoft is leaning on CFG (control flow guard) in Windows 10, to overtake EMET. CFG isn’t perfect either[3], but it’s a step in the right direction.

### Managed Code

DevOps is the rapid engineering and release cycle that web apps are commonly built in. The threats here are different but no less pressing. There’s so much code, needed so soon, that proper testing is often not possible. Command injections, client-side scripts, and all the typical design issues are common flaws. Using the right frameworks, best coding practices, automated scanners, and perhaps WAFs (web application firewalls) are common protections. Pentesting final products is a good bet too, as always.

### Isolation

It’s possible to put most apps, rather native or managed into a sandbox (lesser privileged jail) or VM. That is always a good idea. Popular apps such as browsers do this for rendering tabs, to minimize the risk should a vulnerability be triggered within that heavy processing (images, movies, scripts, etc.) and risky environment. Least privilege is still a good defense-in-depth strategy.

### Conclusion

For a more detailed look at these concerns, Take a look at  “Security: for Hackers and Developers” on PluralSight or [Contact Us](https://www.vdalabs.com/contact/) to chat.

# Professional IoT Hacking Series: Target Selection & Firmware Analysis

[Home](https://www.vdalabs.com/) [Cybersecurity Insights](https://www.vdalabs.com/from-the-experts/) **Professional IoT Hacking Series: Target Selection & Firmware Analysis**

[Exploit Development](https://www.vdalabs.com/category/exploit-development/)

![professional IOT hacking](data:image/svg+xml...)

When considering where to spend limited penetration testing resources, most organizations (and penetration testing shops) focus on the typical mix of servers and workstations normally found in every organization. While this is a necessary area of focus, other things like that IoT device sitting on the edge of a network can be quite the playground for hackers that are willing to do a little reverse engineering. In this blog series on “Professional IoT Hacking,” VDA Labs will demonstrate some of the ways we attack IoT devices and hopefully communicate just how damaging these devices can be to an organization’s security posture.

## Time warp to the 1990’s

Most modern, traditional operating systems (that are used on things like servers and workstations) have the security advantages of years of use across many different organizations and vetting by talented security researches. Centralized methods for releasing security updates and layers of additional protections have been added over the years. For example, at one point Windows did not have Executable space protection (DEP), Address space layout randomization (ALSR), or even stack canaries. These memory corruption protections were all developed to make it harder for attackers to abuse control flow hijacking.

With the rise of IoT, it would have been wonderful if all the lessons learned from traditional operating system security were implemented as a new security baseline, but that is often not the case. Due to the embedded nature of many IoT operating systems, traditional operating system security hardening is thrown out window — which means its like being time warped back to the 1990’s for attackers trying to find exploits. Perhaps in the rush to beat competitors to market first, many modern IoT device operating systems and applications seem to be missing even the basics of input sanitization, resulting in a playground for exploit developers. Is your organization really considering the risk that IoT devices bring to your networks? Hopefully, the following articles in this blog series will help bring awareness to just how vulnerable modern IoT devices are.

## Selecting our research target

To demonstrate how we go about finding vulnerabilities in modern IoT devices (network cameras, connected cars, building controllers, ICS, routers, etc), VDA Labs decided to spend a few hours of focused research time on a particular IoT camera. This device first came on our radar during an actual penetration test. While looking for ways to pivot into a restricted internal network subnet, for some reason access to this IoT camera running inside the restricted subnet was allowed. By dynamically fuzzing the web interface for this particular IoT camera, a zero day command execution vulnerability was discovered, which allowed a foothold to be established inside the restricted subnet.

The device chosen is a fully patched and update version of [VIVOTEK’s FD8136](https://www.vivotek.com/fd8136/). The only reason VDA decided to pick this device for research is because we stumbled across it during a penetration test, but one thing to note is that this device dose not have any disclosed [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) (CVE). Many people might think this is a good sign, and would perhaps prefer that the device or software they use have a clean CVE track record, but in our experience a lack of CVE history is typically because the device or software has not been properly vetted for vulnerabilities. We prefer to use devices and software that have a good track record of mitigating disclosed vulnerabilities.

![Vivotek CVEs](data:image/svg+xml...)
## Decompressing target firmware

Throughout this blog series on Professional IoT Hacking, we plan to demonstrate several different types of static and dynamic analysis that can be used to assess any IoT device. To that end, we purchased a fully functional version of the target device for dynamic analysis and fuzzing, but an obvious place to get started was reverse engineering target device firmware. As with lots of IoT devices, the latest version of the firmware (version 0301a) was available online for [public download](http://download.vivotek.com/downloadfile/downloads/firmware/fd8136firmware.zip). In cases where the firmware for a target device is not easily available, it is often possible to obtain a Man-in-the-middle position on the target device in your research lab, then capture new device firmware off the wire when it downloads. Common methods for doing this include sniffing wireless interface traffic with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), using an ethernet tap device like the [Throwing Star LAN Tap](https://greatscottgadgets.com/throwingstar/) or [Packet Squirrel](https://www.hak5.org/gear/packet-squirrel), or simply using ARP poisoning on a local subnet to sniff traffic between the target device and its internet gateway.

After downloading the firmware, we opened the ZIP file with a linux virtual machine, and quickly noticed the file “FD8136-VVTK-0301a.flash.pkg” as probably containing the firmware we want to decompress.

![Downloaded firmware](data:image/svg+xml...)![Downloaded firmware](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downloaded-firmware-600x170-1.png)

Running the “file” command simply returned “data” so we turned to [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk), our favorite firmware decompression tool. In the screen capture below, the command “binwalk -e -M ./FD8136-VVTK-0301a.flash.pkg” was used to recursively decompress our target FD8136 Network Camera firmware. We have found that Binwalk typically works best on a Linux distro, like Ubuntu or Debian — sometimes it does not work as well when trying to use it on Mac OSX.

![binwalk](data:image/svg+xml...)![binwalk](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/binwalk1-600x283-1.png)

During the decompression process, Binwalk recursively identified [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) compressed data, a [squashfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS) file system, and eventually decompressed ARM 32-bit ELF files. This information will come in handy later when doing things like reverse engineering and fuzzing the ARM binaries for memory corruption vulnerabilities or searching cgi scripts for command injection.

![binwalk](data:image/svg+xml...)![binwalk](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/binwalk2-600x195-1.png)

At this point, we have successfully decompressed the firmware and have full access to the underlying filesystem that would be running on the actual device. This contains loads of helpful information about the device, like the path “../squashfs-root/etc/” contains config files, but one particular path of interest is “../squashfs-root/usr/share/www/cgi-bin/,” because it contains the scripts and binaries that are used to manage the device from its web interface. Later in this blog series, we will find that several of these are exposed to non-authenticated users via the [Boa web server](http://www.boa.org/) interface running on TCP port 80.

![filesystem](data:image/svg+xml...)![filesystem](https://www.vdalabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/filesystem-600x257-1.png)
## Next steps

At this point in the process, we have picked a research target and successfully downloaded and decompressed firmware that will actually be running on the device. Quick analysis of the decompressed firmware uncovered attack surface that will be of interest (Boa web server) when later attempting to remotely exploit the device. Future posts in this “Professional IoT Hacking” series will cover fun topics like using [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) to statically identify memory corruption vulnerabilities in ARM binaries, using [BurpSuite Pro](https://portswigger.net/burp) to dynamically fuzz the web management interface for command injection and memory corruption, emulating ARM binaries for fuzzing with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), using [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to help with exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, possibly dumping device firmware with [JTAGulator](http://www.grandideastudio.com/jtagulator/), and more. As a side note to this blog series, VDA Labs will be using a [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=4718642) for the zero day vulnerabilities identified during this research.  (Follow CVE-2018-14494, CVE-2018-14495, and CVE-2018-14496.)
