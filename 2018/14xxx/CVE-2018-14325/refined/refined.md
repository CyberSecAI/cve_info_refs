  "info": "The provided content contains details regarding CVE-2018-14325, which is an integer underflow vulnerability in MP4v2. \n\nRoot cause:\nThe vulnerability stems from an integer underflow when parsing an atom's size in the `MP4Atom::Read` function within the `mp4atom.cpp` file.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe core issue is a missing check before subtracting the header size (`hdrSize`) from the data size (`dataSize`). If `dataSize` (read from the file) is less than `hdrSize`, the subtraction results in an integer underflow, making `dataSize` a very large unsigned integer. This leads to the creation of a corrupted atom with an incorrect, large size.\n\nImpact:\nThis can lead to memory corruption and potentially a crash. Specifically, the flawed size calculation allows the code to bypass a size check, and an incorrect size is used, leading to out of bound access. \n\nAttack vector:\nThe attack vector involves crafting a malicious MP4 file where an atom's data size is smaller than its header size. This triggers the underflow during the atom parsing process, corrupting memory. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nThe attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted MP4 file as input to the vulnerable software. No special privileges or network access is needed."
