- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software does not properly validate user-supplied data when parsing specific files, leading to write operations beyond the allocated memory object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow for arbitrary code execution under the context of an administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specific files by the vulnerable application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to supply specially crafted files to the application. The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have access to the system where the vulnerable software is running. User interaction is required, as the user needs to open the malicious file.
