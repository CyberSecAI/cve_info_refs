{
  "CVE-2018-14620": {
    "description": "The openstack-rabbitmq-container image insecurely retrieves the rabbitmq_clusterer component over HTTP during the build stage. This could potentially allow an attacker to serve malicious code to the image builder and install in the resultant container image.",
    "root_cause": "Insecure download of the rabbitmq_clusterer component over HTTP without validation during the docker image build process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure download over HTTP",
      "Lack of validation of downloaded component"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially serve malicious code to the image builder, leading to the installation of malicious code within the resultant container image.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack on the HTTP connection during download"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify the HTTP traffic during the image build process."
