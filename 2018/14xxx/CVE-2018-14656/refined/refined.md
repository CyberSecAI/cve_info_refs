Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing address check in the `show_opcodes()` function within the Linux kernel. This function is used to dump instruction opcodes into the kernel's message buffer (`dmesg`). The vulnerability occurs because `show_opcodes()` doesn't properly validate the provided address before attempting to read and dump the opcodes from memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Address Check:** The core weakness is the lack of a check to ensure that the address from which opcodes are read is within a valid range when called from user mode.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `show_opcodes()` function can be called in scenarios triggered by user-mode, where the instruction pointer (`regs->ip`) could be manipulated by a malicious process to point to arbitrary kernel memory locations.
- **User-Controlled RIP:** The user-controlled `regs->ip` allows an attacker to specify the memory location from where opcodes will be dumped into `dmesg`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read:** A malicious user-space process can force the kernel to dump the contents of arbitrary kernel memory to the `dmesg` log.
- **Information Disclosure:** This leaked kernel memory can contain sensitive information, potentially including:
    - Kernel data structures
    - Cryptographic keys
    - Other secrets

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Triggering a Page Fault:** A malicious user-space process can trigger a page fault by jumping to a kernel address.
- **Manipulating RIP:** The attacker controls the `regs->ip` register within the context of a page fault, pointing it to a location in kernel memory that they wish to read.
- **Calling `show_opcodes()`:** The page fault handler, in some code paths, calls `show_opcodes()` with the manipulated instruction pointer, causing the kernel to dump memory based on this attacker-controlled address into `dmesg`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User-Level Access:** Exploitation can be performed from user-level, without the need for root or administrative privileges in initial stage.
- **Understanding of Kernel Memory Layout (Optional):** While not strictly necessary for exploitation, an attacker with some knowledge of kernel memory layout can target specific memory areas that may contain sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check within `show_opcodes()` to prevent dumping of kernel memory when called from user mode using `__chk_range_not_ok` to validate the address range before reading the opcodes from memory.
- **Affected Kernel Versions:** The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel versions after v4.18-rc1 and fixed in v4.19-rc2.
- **Specific Code Changes:** The fix involves modifying `arch/x86/include/asm/stacktrace.h`, `arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c`, and `arch/x86/mm/fault.c`.
- **Red Hat Bugzilla:** The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this CVE confirms the vulnerability and that a fix was included in Fedora 4.18.6 updates.
- **Project Zero:** The vulnerability was initially reported by Google's Project Zero team.
