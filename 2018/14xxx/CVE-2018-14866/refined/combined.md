## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32509#issue-430456694)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-9

Incorrect access control in the TransientModel framework in Odoo Community 11.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 and earlier allows authenticated attackers to access data in transient records that they do not own by making an RPC call before garbage collection occurs.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Core

**Credits**: Florent de Labarre

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14866](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14866)

## I. Background

The Odoo framework includes a mechanism for managing temporary records, known as

TransientModels, for the purpose of containing transient data while a certain

screen or operation is in progress. Such records are regularly deleted by a

garbage collector job.

The security model for regulating access to TransientModels is different from

regular non-transient ones, in that there are not customizable access rights.

A default, hardcoded security policy makes those transient records accessible

only to the user who created them (the owner), and to the administrator.

## II. Problem Description

The implementation of the security model for TransientModels was incomplete,

to the effect that some operations were possible by users on transient

records that they did not own.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Unprivileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Low :: 3.5

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

An attacker with an unprivileged user account (even portal users) may be able to

retrieve values of fields from transient records that they did not own, via

specially crafted RPC requests, in the interval between their creation and the

automatic garbage collection.

Such transient records may include limited business or sensitive data that

should not have been accessible to the attacker.

Exploitation would however be difficult in practice, limited by the need to

actually have TransientModels that include sensitive data (which depends on

installed modules), by the need to have a privileged user populate transient

records with the data, and by the need to execute the attack in the limited time

window before the automatic garbage collection.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

No workaround is known, so applying the patch or updating is strongly

recommended.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [67bf250](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/67bf250ea5035e2e8e4da7e32f2671beb75cfab4)
* 10.0: [e93fa78](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/e93fa785629500e997330731d84853eb2edac299)
* 11.0: [4b1b70a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4b1b70a77a482926aa87503a8ef9d0aec5c5293f)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.
