Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14866:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete implementation of the security model for TransientModels in Odoo. TransientModels are meant to hold temporary data during specific operations and are regularly deleted by a garbage collector. The intended security policy restricts access to these records to the creator (owner) and administrators. However, the incomplete implementation allowed users to perform some operations on transient records they did not own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The core weakness is the inadequate enforcement of access controls for TransientModels. Authenticated, unprivileged users could potentially access data in transient records that were not created by them.
- **Incomplete Security Model Implementation:**  The security model for TransientModels was not fully implemented, leading to the possibility of unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could retrieve field values from transient records they didn't own, potentially exposing business or sensitive data. This data is intended to be only accessible to the user who created them.
- **Limited Impact:** The impact is somewhat limited by:
    - The need for TransientModels containing sensitive data.
    - The requirement for a privileged user to populate those records.
    - The limited timeframe before garbage collection removes the records.
- **No known use in the wild**: Odoo S.A. was not aware of any exploitation of the vulnerability in the wild.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **RPC Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific RPC requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:**  An attacker needs an unprivileged user account to exploit this vulnerability. This includes even "portal users" with limited access.
- **Timing:** The attack must occur within a limited window, specifically between record creation and the garbage collection cycle.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific RPC requests to access the data.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions, versions 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0
- Patches are available to fix the vulnerability for each version.
- No workaround is known.
