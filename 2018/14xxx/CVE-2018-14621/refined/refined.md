Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw introduced in libtirpc when it switched from `select()` to `poll()` for handling network connections. Specifically, when the system runs out of file descriptors (EMFILE error), the server enters an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite loop:** The core issue is that the server, upon encountering an EMFILE error, gets stuck in an infinite loop.
- **Lack of error handling:**  The server fails to gracefully handle the EMFILE error, leading to the infinite loop. In prior versions, the oldest connection was dropped to make room for a new one and this was not present with the port to poll.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop consumes a large amount of CPU time, making the server unresponsive and denying service to legitimate clients. This effectively leads to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File Descriptor Exhaustion:** The vulnerability is triggered when a server exhausts its available file descriptors. An attacker could achieve this by making a large number of connections or requests.
- **Remote attack:** The attack is triggered due to a large number of connections which can be done remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish enough connections to exhaust the server's file descriptor limit.
- The attacker can be remote, since the vulnerability is triggered by network connections.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced when libtirpc switched from `select()` to `poll()` around version 0.3.3.
- Prior to this change, when hitting EMFILE/ENFILE, the "most idle" connection was dropped before retrying, preventing the infinite loop.
- The bug was fixed in libtirpc version 1.0.2-rc2, with the fix being a commit that can be found here: `http://git.linux-nfs.org/?p=steved/libtirpc.git;a=commit;h=fce98161d9815ea016855d9f00274276452c2c4b`.
