The provided content contains information about an integer overflow vulnerability in the `batchTransfer()` function of the SHARKTECH (SKT) token contract, along with similar vulnerabilities in other token contracts.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the calculation of the total amount to be transferred in the `batchTransfer()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `batchTransfer()` function calculates the total transfer amount as `cnt * _value` where `cnt` is the number of recipients and `_value` is the amount to transfer to each recipient.
- The code does not properly handle the case where the multiplication `cnt * _value` results in an integer overflow.
- The code checks if `amount == 0` which does not prevent the overflow, and there is no check on the intermediate result before the check on the sender's balance, `if(balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount)`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can transfer tokens to a large number of addresses, with a large value and cause the `amount` variable to overflow, resulting in a small total amount being deducted from the sender's balance.
- The recipients still receive the specified `_value`, allowing the attacker to mint tokens.
- The attacker can manipulate token balances for their benefit.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerable function `batchTransfer()` can be called by any user of the contract.
- The attacker needs to call the `batchTransfer` function with a large `_value` and number of `_receivers` that will cause integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have at least two recipient addresses.
- The attacker needs to have sufficient initial token balance to initiate the overflow transaction.

The content provides additional information about the vulnerability by providing vulnerable code examples from various other tokens (Malaysia coins(Xmc), MP3 Coin(MP3), Neo Genesis Token(NGT), WeMediaChain(WMC), Rocket Coin(XRC), GlobeCoin(GLB)) and highlighting that similar vulnerabilities can occur in other token contracts.
