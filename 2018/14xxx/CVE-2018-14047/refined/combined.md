# SEGV in function pngwriter::readfromfile(CVE-2018-14047)

**Update:this issue should be in libpng rather than in pngwrite**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I use **Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer** to build **pngwriter v0.7.0**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/pngwriter/crash_SEGV_readfromfile) can cause SEGV signal when running the **test** `blackwhite` in folder `pngwriter-build` with the following command:

```
./blackwhite crash_SEGV_readfromfile
```

This is the ASAN information:

```
libpng error: Read Error

## Description

[![@fouzhe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17958943?u=4abe79664e020f3240e34a74f489801b906fbb55&v=4&size=48)](/fouzhe)[fouzhe](https://github.com/fouzhe)opened [on Jul 11, 2018](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter/issues/129#issue-340207920)

I use **Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer** to build **pngwriter v0.7.0**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/pngwriter/crash_SEGV_readfromfile) can cause SEGV signal when running the **test** `blackwhite` in folder `pngwriter-build` with the following command:

```
./blackwhite crash_SEGV_readfromfile
```

This is the ASAN information:

```
libpng error: Read Error
 PNGwriter::read_png_info - ERROR **: This file may be a corrupted PNG file. (setjmp(*png_ptr)->jmpbf) failed).
 PNGwriter::readfromfile - ERROR **: Error opening file AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL
