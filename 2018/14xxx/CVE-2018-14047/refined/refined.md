Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2018-14047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `pngwriter::readfromfile` function of the `pngwriter` library when handling a specially crafted or corrupted PNG file. Specifically, it seems related to how the function handles errors during file reading, and a potential null or invalid pointer dereference when using `strlen`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The `pngwriter::readfromfile` function appears to have insufficient error handling when opening or reading PNG files. When the file is corrupted or invalid, the function attempts to read a string from an invalid memory location.

- **Null/Invalid Pointer Dereference:** The ASAN output indicates a read memory access violation during a call to `strlen` after an error during PNG reading, suggesting the function attempts to perform a `strlen` operation on a null or invalid memory address.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash (Denial of Service):** The primary impact is a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing the application using the `pngwriter` library to crash. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious PNG file:** An attacker could craft a malicious PNG file designed to trigger the vulnerability when opened by an application using the vulnerable `pngwriter` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PNG file to an application using the vulnerable `pngwriter` library. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Uploading the file to a server that processes it using `pngwriter`.
    - Tricking a user into opening the malicious file in an application using `pngwriter`.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue was initially reported by `fouzhe` as an issue in `pngwriter`, but was later suggested to be related to `libpng`.
- The provided ASAN output provides detailed information on the crash location, including the call stack leading to the segmentation fault.
- The crash is triggered by a call to `strlen` inside `std::operator<<` which is part of a standard output stream (`std::ostream`). It suggests an attempt to print or log an error message during the file reading, but that the string pointer was invalid at this point.
- The provided file `crash_SEGV_readfromfile` was used to trigger the vulnerability.

In summary, the vulnerability allows a remote or local attacker to trigger a crash in an application using `pngwriter` by providing a specially crafted PNG file, resulting in a denial-of-service.
