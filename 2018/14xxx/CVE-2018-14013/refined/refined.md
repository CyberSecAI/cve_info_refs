Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Zimbra Collaboration web client, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by unsanitized user input within specific URLs and file import functionalities, resulting in reflected XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Two distinct XSS vulnerabilities are present. One is triggered by crafting a specific URL with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter, while the second one occurs during the import of a file with a malicious name.
*   **CWE-79:** This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79, which is improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   Potentially perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web page.
*   Redirect the user to malicious sites or trigger other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS#1:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL and tricks the victim into clicking the link (e.g., via email, social media, or another website).
*   **XSS#2:** The attacker prepares a file with a malicious name, such as `test.<svg onload=alert(2)>`, and convinces the victim to import it via Zimbra's import/export functionality within preferences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely; they do not need direct access to the Zimbra server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click a malicious link or import a specially crafted file.
*   **No authentication required for XSS#1:** The first XSS vector does not require the user to be logged in before clicking the link. However, the link redirects the user to the login page, where the javascript is executed.
*   **User interaction required:** Exploiting both vulnerabilities requires the victim to interact with the malicious URL or file.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Zimbra Collaboration versions prior to 8.8.11 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.8.11. Partial fixes for XSS#1 were included in patch 1 for 8.8.10 and patch 6 for 8.8.9.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 6.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   **Timeline:** The vulnerability was initially discovered on 12/07/2018 and publicly disclosed on 30/01/2019.

**Summary of Proof of Concepts:**
*   **XSS#1:** crafting the URL parameter `id` with a payload such as `><svg onload=alert(1)>`
*   **XSS#2:** import a file with a malicious name such as `test.<svg onload=alert(2)>`
