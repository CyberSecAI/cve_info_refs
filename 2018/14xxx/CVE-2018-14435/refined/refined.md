Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `DecodeImage()` function within the `coders/pcd.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, memory allocated for `buffer` is not freed in the exception handling branch of the code, which can be triggered by invalid or corrupt image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. The code allocates memory using `AcquireQuantumMemory` but fails to release it in a specific error handling path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Repeatedly triggering the memory leak by providing specially crafted or corrupted PCD images can lead to memory exhaustion and ultimately a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This happens because the unreleased memory accumulates over time.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted or corrupted PCD image file, which is a Picture CD format.
- **File Input:** The attack vector involves providing an image via file input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input files:** The attacker needs the ability to supply an image file to be processed by ImageMagick. This may involve uploading a crafted image to a service using ImageMagick for image processing or providing a local file if ImageMagick is run on user-controlled data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue ([#1193](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1193)) gives more specific detail regarding the vulnerability than the CVE description alone.
- The `coders/pcd.c` file and the `DecodeImage()` function are the vulnerable code locations
- The code allocates memory using `AcquireQuantumMemory(0x800,sizeof(*buffer))` which allocates a buffer.
- The exception handling path is the `default:` case inside a `switch` statement at [line 286](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/master/coders/pcd.c#L286)
