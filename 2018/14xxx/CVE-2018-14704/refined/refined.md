{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The URL handler for the MySQL API does not properly sanitize the provided URL path before generating error messages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that executes within the user's browser under the context of the vulnerable Drobo device's HTTP domain, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious URLs and sending them to a user, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary Javascript in the victim's browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user of the vulnerable Drobo device. The user must then click on the link."
