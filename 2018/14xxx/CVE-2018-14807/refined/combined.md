## 4. MITIGATIONS

Opto 22 recommends users upgrade to the newest version.

For more information about this update, please refer to the provided link:

<https://www.opto22.com/support/resources-tools/knowledgebase/kb87547>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

# Editing an OptoScript block containing a long string literal without spaces may cause PAC Control to crash

---

### Applies To:

PAC Control Basic

PAC Control Professional

### Versions Affected:

All versions through R10.a

### Resolved In Version:

R10.0b

---

### Symptoms:

PAC Control may crash when you try to edit an OptoScript block containing a string literal that is longer than 63 characters and has no spaces. This may happen regardless of whether the OptoScript block is a chart or a subroutine.

This issue presents a stack-based overflow vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to remotely execute code on the target PC using a maliciously crafted PAC Control strategy.

[NCCIC](https://www.dhs.gov/national-cybersecurity-and-communications-integration-center) has assigned [CVE-2018-04154](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-04154) to identify this vulnerability.

### Resolution:

Opto 22 has resolved this issue.
