Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-14059:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** Multiple text fields and data entries within the Pimcore application lack proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of input validation and sanitization on text fields and data entries.
*   The application stores the unsanitized input, leading to persistent XSS.

**Impact:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users of the web application.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of other users.
    *   Browser exploits and delivery of trojan horses

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker must be authenticated to the Pimcore application.
*   The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable text fields or data entries.
*   When another user accesses the page where the malicious code is stored, the JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   Valid user account credentials within the application.
*   Ability to access and modify the vulnerable text fields and data entries.

**Specific vulnerable areas include:**

*   Editing user account details (first name, last name, email address).
*   Editing values in tables such as Document Types, Predefined Properties, Predefined Asset Metadata, Quantity Value, Static Routes.
*   Renaming items such as Assets, Data Objects, Video Thumbnails, Image Thumbnails, Field-Collections, Objectbrick, Classification Store items.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor acknowledges the XSS vulnerabilities but has chosen not to fix many of them, particularly those impacting administrative functionalities. They argue that these areas are only accessed by trusted users and thus the risk is low, but SEC Consult disagrees, pointing out that higher privileged users can also be attacked through this vulnerability.
*   The vendor considers the fix for XSS an "additional overhead without any benefits for security".
*   The vulnerability was found in Pimcore version 5.2.3 and was partially fixed in version 5.3.0. However, the vendor stated that they will not fix XSS issues related to administrative functions.
