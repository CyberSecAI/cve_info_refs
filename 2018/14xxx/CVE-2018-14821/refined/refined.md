Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic. Specifically, when processing a malformed CIP packet with type ID 0xb2 in command 0x6f (send RR data), the software copies data into a heap buffer. The length of the data copied is determined by the attacker-controlled TypeDataLen field. If this length exceeds the buffer's capacity within the CPacket object, it leads to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The application does not properly validate the size of the incoming data against the size of the heap buffer.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application trusts attacker-provided lengths when copying data into the heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause the RSLinx Classic application to terminate. The user must manually restart the software to regain functionality.
- **Potential for other impacts:** Although not explicitly stated in this context, heap overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Malicious CIP Packets:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted CIP packet to Port 44818 (the default port for EtherNet/IP).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the network or the target system.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target system running RSLinx Classic.
- **Ability to craft malformed CIP packets:** The attacker must be able to craft a CIP packet with specific type ID (0xb2) and command (0x6f), as well as control the length and data being copied.
- **Low skill level:** According to the ICS-CERT advisory, the vulnerability is exploitable remotely by attackers with a low skill level.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic versions 4.00.01 and prior.
- The vulnerability is related to how RSLinx Classic handles the parsing of EtherNet/IP and Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) messages.
- The specific vulnerability lies in how the program processes Type ID 0xb2 within command 0x6f, and the vulnerable function is called when the command specific data block within the EtherNet/IP message is being processed.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious packet to port 44818.
- The issue is due to the lack of a check for the size of the data before copying it to a heap buffer, which leads to memory corruption.
