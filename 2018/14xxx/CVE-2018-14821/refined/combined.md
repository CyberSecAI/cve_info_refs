# [R1] RSLinx Classic Buffer Overflows

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While researching Rockwell Automation RSLinx Classic, Tenable found a couple of buffer overflow issues in RSLinx Classic Lite 4.0.1.2. The vulnerabilities may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve remote code execution or denial of service.

RSLinx Classic Lite (RSLINX.exe) implements the [EtherNet/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EtherNet/IP) protocol which encapsulates [Common Industrial Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Industrial_Protocol) (CIP) messages. An EtherNet/IP packet consists of a 24-byte header followed by command specific data:

```

struct hdr
{
	uint16 command;
	uint16 length;	// length of the command excluding the header
	uint32 SessionHandle;
	uint32 status;
	octet  SenderContext[8];
	unit32 options
};

```

Inside the command specific data block, various CIP-specific length fields can be specified. These include the length of a type ID (a 2-byte field), the length of a connection path (a 1-byte field), and the length of an extended link address in the port path segment in the connection path.

```

uint16 TypeLength;		// length of a Type ID
octet  ConnectionPathLength;    // number of 16-bit items
octet  LinkAddressSize;	        // length of an Extended Link Address

```

Although RSLINX.exe limits the command specific data block to 4500 bytes:

```

.text:5878CEDF      movzx   edx, [ecx+CLinxServer.hdr_in.len]
.text:5878CEE6      mov     [ebp+var_BodyLen], edx
.text:5878CEE9      cmp     [ebp+var_BodyLen], 0
.text:5878CEED      jl      short invalid_len
.text:5878CEEF      cmp     [ebp+var_BodyLen], 4500 ; command specific block max length
.text:5878CEF6      jle     short read_body

```

It does not check various CIP-specific length fields against the number of received network data in many code paths. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this to cause memory corruption issues.

#### CVE-2018-14829: Stack Buffer Overflow

There is a function in **ENGINE.dll** that parses a connection path to extract a port path segment and stores it in a stack buffer. The attacker can specify a large port path segment to overflow the stack buffer:

```

.text:6950B0E4      movzx   eax, [ebp+var_sizeFromPortSeg] ; size from input port path segment; attacker-controlled
.text:6950B0E8      push    eax ; size_t
.text:6950B0E9      mov     ecx, [ebp+var_pConnPath]
.text:6950B0EC      push    ecx ; void *
.text:6950B0ED      mov     edx, [ebp+arg_pOut_PortSegLen] ; set to 0 on function entry
.text:6950B0F0      movzx   eax, word ptr [edx]
.text:6950B0F3      add     eax, [ebp+arg_pOut_PortSeg] ; buffer on the stack; 128ish bytes
.text:6950B0F6      push    eax ; void *
.text:6950B0F7      call    memcpy

```

The attacker can specify up to 255 bytes of port path segment as the length field for the segment is 1-byte wide. On a 32-bit Windows 7 SP1 with **ENGINE.dll** version 4.0.1.2, the stack buffer is about 0xD4 bytes from the function return address. So the local variables after stack buffer and data after the return address can be overwritten. The following WinDbg output shows 0x102 bytes of attacker-controlled data is being copied to a 128-byte stack buffer:

```

#### CVE-2018-14821 - Heap Buffer Overflow

When type ID 0xb2 is specified in command 0x6f (send RR data), the type's data is copied to a heap buffer within a CPacket object. If the attacker specifies a large type length, they can overflow the heap buffer in the CPacket object:

```

.text:5F6421B3      jle     short loc_5F6421D3
.text:5F6421B5      movzx   ecx, [ebp+arg_TypeDataLen] ; attacker-controlled len up to 0xffff
.text:5F6421B5                                         ; heap overflow!
.text:5F6421B9      push    ecx                        ; size_t
.text:5F6421BA      mov     edx, [ebp+arg_pTypeData]   ; attacker-controlled data
.text:5F6421BD      push    edx                        ; void *
.text:5F6421BE      mov     eax, [ebp+var_pCPacket]
.text:5F6421C1      mov     ecx, [eax+CPacket.pAppData]
.text:5F6421C7      add     ecx, TYPE.data
.text:5F6421CA      push    ecx                        ; heap buffer of 0x1330ish bytes
.text:5F6421CB      call    _memcpy

```

The vulnerable function attempts to copy 0x1fff bytes from the source buffer to a heap buffer. However, the destination heap buffer has less than that. An exception is thrown when attempting to copy 0x1fff bytes of data to a heap buffer of less than 0x1336 bytes:

```

0:017> g

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released a new version of the software that can found at Rockwell Automation knowledgebase article KB 1075712 (login is required):

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1075712>

Rockwell Automation also reports that users can disable Port 44818 if it is not utilized during system operation. For more details on how to disable the port and for Rockwell Automation’s general security guidelines, please visit knowledgebase article KB 1075747 (login is required):

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1075747>

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1075747>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
