{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper filtering of uploaded files within the CKEditor's file manager. Specifically, it allowed the upload of HTML files which can contain malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient file type validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code. When a user opens/executes this uploaded file, the injected script will be executed within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the CKEditor file manager within the Subrion CMS.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the CKEditor file manager, which typically implies having some level of administrative or content editing access to the Subrion CMS."
