The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, specifically addressing a fix for an open redirection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `next` parameter in the login and signup handlers. The application was using `url.QueryUnescape` on the provided `next` URL, and then redirecting the user there. This allowed an attacker to specify a malicious URL as the `next` parameter, leading to an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirection:** The application was vulnerable to open redirection because it was blindly redirecting users to URLs specified in the `next` parameter, after unescaping.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** The initial check for the `redirectURL` was insufficient. It only checked if it was empty or had an error during unescaping, and then defaulted to `/`. It did not validate the URL's host.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers could craft malicious links that, when clicked, would redirect users to a malicious website after appearing to log into the legitimate application. This can be used to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to websites hosting malware.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL parameter:** An attacker can modify the `next` parameter of the login or signup URL. For example `/login?next=https://evil.com`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs containing the malicious redirect target and have the victim user click such link.
* No special access or position within the application is required.

**Fix:**
The fix ensures that the redirect URL is set to `/` if the provided URL is empty, has error, or does not begin with a `/`, thus mitigating the open redirect vulnerability. The fix was done in `views/auth.go`.
