    "description": "In Bootstrap before 4.1.2, XSS is possible in the collapse data-parent attribute.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `data-parent` attribute in the collapse component is vulnerable to XSS because it is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious HTML and JavaScript to be injected.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious HTML document with a `data-parent` attribute containing the malicious JavaScript, which, when rendered by a web browser, will execute.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML code into an application that uses the vulnerable version of Bootstrap and its collapse functionality. The attacker must also induce a user to view the crafted page."
