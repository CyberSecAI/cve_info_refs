Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `$keywords` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `$keywords` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, in some cases, SQL injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** Full compromise of the system is possible, depending on the database user privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `keywords` parameter in the HTTP GET request.
*   **Direct SQL injection in the `WHERE` clause:** Specifically, the vulnerable code constructs a `WHERE` clause in a SQL query using unsanitized user-supplied input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the existence of the vulnerable `keywords` parameter in `coreframe/app/order/admin/goods.php`.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
$keywords = isset($GLOBALS['keywords']) ? trim($GLOBALS['keywords']) : '';
...
if($keywords) {
    if($keytype==0) {
        $where .= $where ? " AND order_no LIKE '$keywords%'" : "order_no LIKE '$keywords%'";
    } elseif($keytype==1 && $keywords) {
      ...
    }
}
```

This demonstrates how the `$keywords` variable is directly used in the SQL query, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Proof of Concept (POC):**
The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability:
`/index.php?m=order&f=goods&v=listing&_su=wuzhicms&_menuid=220&search=&cardtype=-1&keytype=0&keywords='and+extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,md5(123)))%23`

This POC uses an `extractvalue` SQL function to extract a value calculated using the `md5` function, which confirms the successful injection.
