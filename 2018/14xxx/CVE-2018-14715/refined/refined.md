The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14715.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the misuse of the `blockhash(uint blockNumber)` function in the Cryptogs smart contract. Specifically, the contract doesn't validate if the provided `blockNumber` is within the range of the 256 most recent blocks. In Solidity, `blockhash()` returns '0' when the block number is older than 256 blocks from the current block.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Randomness:** The smart contract uses `blockhash()` to generate random numbers. Due to the lack of validation on the block number, attackers can manipulate the input to the function, causing `blockhash()` to return 0. This makes the generated random numbers predictable.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The smart contract fails to ensure that the `blockNumber` used in the `blockhash()` function is within the valid range of 256 most recent blocks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Game Manipulation:** Attackers can predict the outcome of the coin flip and slammer throws, allowing them to always win and gain all pogs.
- **Financial Loss:** Players who engage with the contract without exploiting the vulnerability can potentially lose their pogs to attackers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Timing:** The attacker exploits the timing by waiting for more than 256 blocks to pass after calling `startCoinFlip()` or `raiseSlammer()` before calling `endCoinFlip()` or `throwSlammer()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a participant in the game and able to call the `startCoinFlip()`, `endCoinFlip()`, `raiseSlammer()`, and `throwSlammer()` functions of the smart contract.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control the `_reveal` argument when calling `endCoinFlip()` and `throwSlammer()`.

**More details than CVE description:**
- The content provides specific details on how the game functions use the vulnerable `blockhash` function in `endCoinFlip()` and `throwSlammer()` functions to generate random numbers for the coin flip and slammer throws.
- The content also includes a specific exploit scenario, including a magic `_reveal` value that guarantees a win, and a link to an example of exploitation in the Ropsten test network.
