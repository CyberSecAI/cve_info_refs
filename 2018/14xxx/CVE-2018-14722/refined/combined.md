# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

"Some (most?) of the kernel [security] bugs that get fixed don't go
through" linux-distros as well.

I'm not entirely happy with the wording used there, which currently is:

---
Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
<linux-distros@...openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
<<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>>
---

This says that "Distros [...] will generally request at least a few days
of embargo", but the actual policy of (linux-)distros is that the
reporter must provide a tentative public disclosure date/time in their
very first message.

Also, this doesn't say that by disclosing something to (linux-)distros
the reporter accepts the list's policy, and leaves actually reading that
wiki page with the policy optional.

I don't readily have suggested edits, but we should address these issues
somehow.  Please feel free to suggest edits.

On a related note, this might not be representative, but I ran a Twitter
poll on days of week for vulnerability disclosures:

<https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/923885360001757185>

Poll: What days of week work best for you for public disclosure by
others of vulnerabilities in software you (or your employer, etc.) use?

23% No preference or Other
33% Mon
36% Tue, Wed, Thu
 8% Fri, Sat, Sun

164 votes

12:13 PM - 27 Oct 2017

As you can see, Mon fared really well - almost same as Tue, Wed, Thu
combined, meaning that it might be _the_ preferred day of week for
vulnerability disclosures.  So we probably shouldn't exclude Mondays.

I'm not sure.  The microarchitectural "bugs" would have been
inappropriate to bring to the distros list earlier than in 14 days prior
to their public disclosures, and I don't know if the public disclosure
dates on those were specific enough to achieve that.  Maybe you know?

Thanks!  Ideally, you'd also demonstrate that Microsoft fixed those
issues (where relevant) within days of their public disclosure (so that
some days of advance notice would have made a difference).  Can you?

Or are you merely pointing out the kind of issues that would have been
relevant to you and presumably fixed promptly now, but were not relevant
and thus were not fixed back then?  That's less than ideal if so.

If Microsoft joins for its Linux offerings (including Linux on top of
Windows), then checking if the Linux issues also affect Windows (itself)
would involve sharing beyond the need-to-know condition of
(linux-)distros list policy, so isn't allowed by default.  It could
still be done with explicit approval of the reporter, though, and I
expect most people would give such approval if asked.

I'm not a member of security@k.o, but that list isn't what we're looking
for. We've talked about this with Greg before sending this application,
and he has pointed out that security@k.o is not a disclosure list, but
rather just a way to pull in kernel folks to fix issues. Some (most?) of
the kernel bugs that get fixed don't go through that list to begin with.

The kernel's documentation with regards to security issues and
disclosure actually points to linux-distros:
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst> .

To complicate your question further: the Linux usage on our cloud has
surpassed Windows, as a by-product of that MSRC has started receiving
security reports of issues with Linux code both from users and vendors.
It's also the case that issues that are common for Windows and Linux
(like those speculative hardware bugs) are shared with us via MSRC as
well.

If you think that there's value in connecting between these 3
entities, I'd be happy to do so (maybe as part of a new task).

Indeed. When we debated linux-distros application internally, I tried to
do this estimate based on issues previously handled by linux-distros,
and it seemed like it would be valuable here.

With Sphere it's also hard to guess how are customers will be using it,
it's a rather unique mix of HaaS (the chip contains cores that would
belong to the user) and SaaS (where we provide mechanism to manage the
IoT device that the user will build on). I can go over this in more
detail if you'd like.

With WSLv2, users can choose to bring in a third party distro userspace
to run on top our kernel+lightweight userspace. This means that users
can be running a Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/etc userspace modified to run on
WSLv2, on top of a kernel we supply.

For us it means that we are now the proud owners of multiple
frankensteined distro userspaces as well as a custom kernel. You might
call it out as being derivative of those distros, but I believe that at
the very least this is similar to the OpenVZ/CloudLinux scenario.

Honestly, these ones are even harder to deal with than the regular IaaS
offerings we have: customers who use these offerings expect (and
rightfully so) to be able to boot/update into a secure environment
moments after a public disclosure of a security issue, which is not
something we are able to provide right now.

Sure! Issues on the stats page that would not have been reported to MSRC
but are relevant to us would include:

 - On the kernel side, issues such as CVE-2017-7533
  (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/08/03/2>) would be
  relevant for all our offerings.

 - Core libraries affect us as well, for example CVE-2017-1000408
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/11/4>). This
   would affect our Sphere and SaaS offerings, as well as probably make
   us run through them through test gauntlet for WSLv2.

 - Higher level Linux tools, such as the one in CVE-2018-14722
   (<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/14/7>) affect
   mostly our IaaS offerings, but I expect that we'd again validate the
   rest of our offerings with the fix.

Sure, we'd love to help with the list's pain points.

This could be interesting for us. we already work closely with multiple
distros as part of our public IaaS offering, as well as my work
maintaining the stable tree means I interact often with many subsystem
maintainers. We could leverage that for this task.

I think that this task would also benefit from collaboration with MSRC,
where for example we could verify whether the Bluetooth issue you brought
up would affect Windows, and whether issues reported to MSRC also affect
Linux.

Great! Sounds like a plan.

Subject: CVE-2018-14722: btrfsmaintenance: Code execution

Hi,

SUSE employee Fabian Vogt has found a shell code injection issue in the "btrfsmaintenance" tools.

<https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1102721>

Mounting btrfs images with a label including shell injection characters could cause
the cron jobs (running as root) to execute the include shellcode.

Our proposed fix attached to this email.

bad image can be created with:
	mkfs.btrfs --label "`/evil/command`' /dev/sdx

Ciao, Marcus
