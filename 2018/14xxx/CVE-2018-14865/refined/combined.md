## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32501#issue-430456471)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-1

Report engine in Odoo Community 11.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 and earlier does not use secure options when passing documents to wkhtmltopdf, which allows remote attackers to read local files.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Core

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14865](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14865)

## I. Background

Odoo's report engine relies on the external program "wkhtmltopdf" to generate PDF

documents from HTML files rendered from report templates. Wkhtmltopdf supports

loading remote resources such as images or stylesheets, but also permits loading

local files.

## II. Problem Description

The report engine does not prevent access to local files during rendering by

Wkhtmltopdf.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Unprivileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 7.7

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Untrusted administrators on hosted databases may alter their report templates

in order to trick the report engine into including local server files.

External non-privileged users may also be able to trick the report engine into

including local files, by crafting malicious RPC requests.

Both methods could result in the disclosure of system files that are readable

by the Odoo server process, including Odoo configuration files or other

system files that could possibly include passwords or sensitive data.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can only access files readable

by the Odoo server process. Sensitive files might therefore be

protected by using filesystem-level permissions. However, it is very hard to

effectively secure a system in this manner, so applying the patch or updating

your installation is strongly recommended instead.

Alternatively, the wkhtmltopdf executable could be replaced by a command

script that executes the actual wkhtmltopdf command with an extra parameter

"--disable-local-file-access".

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [d5efba2](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/d5efba256138464618a7bfa8f52beb3eaae50509)
* 10.0: [dae2822](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/dae282279947e1f9cccad5ec0244ee654132509b)
* 11.0: [d255628](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/d255628ecf564d54825a55c662eeee552e66377a)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.
