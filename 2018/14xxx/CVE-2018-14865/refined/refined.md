The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14865.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The report engine in Odoo does not use secure options when passing documents to `wkhtmltopdf`, an external program used to generate PDF documents. Specifically, it allows `wkhtmltopdf` to load local files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure use of `wkhtmltopdf` by the Odoo report engine.
- Lack of input sanitization or restrictions when generating reports.
- Allowing local file access by `wkhtmltopdf` when processing user-provided HTML content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can read local files on the server.
- Disclosure of system files readable by the Odoo server process, including configuration files.
- Potential disclosure of sensitive data, including passwords, if present in accessible files.
- System compromise if sensitive files are accessed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network exploitable.
- Untrusted administrators can alter report templates to include local server files.
- External non-privileged users can craft malicious RPC requests to include local files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An unprivileged user account on the Odoo system is required.
- Ability to modify report templates (for administrators).
- Ability to send crafted RPC requests (for external non-privileged users).
