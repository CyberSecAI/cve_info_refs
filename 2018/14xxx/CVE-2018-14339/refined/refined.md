Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified CVEs:

**CVE-2018-14339**

*   **Root Cause:** The MMSE dissector in Wireshark could enter an infinite loop due to lack of offset and length validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of proper validation within the dissector can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause Wireshark to enter an infinite loop, leading to a crash or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** This can be triggered by a malformed packet on the wire or a malformed packet trace file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker only needs to be able to inject malformed packets into a network where Wireshark is capturing traffic or convince a user to open a malformed capture file.

**CVE-2018-14340**

*   **Root Cause:** Dissectors in Wireshark that support zlib decompression could crash when given a negative length.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability was caused by a missing check for negative lengths during zlib decompression, leading to a buffer over-read.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a crash in Wireshark, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious network traffic or crafted capture files.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malformed network traffic that will be captured by Wireshark or provide a user with a malicious capture file.

**CVE-2018-14341**

*   **Root Cause:**  The DICOM dissector in Wireshark could get into a large or infinite loop due to an offset overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper offset handling in the DICOM dissector can cause infinite loops.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause Wireshark to enter an infinite loop, resulting in a crash or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious DICOM packets or capture files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs to be able to inject malformed DICOM packets or craft malicious capture files.

**CVE-2018-14342**

*  **Root Cause**: The BGP protocol dissector could go into a large loop due to lack of Path Attribute length validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a large loop caused by improper validation of Path Attribute lengths within the BGP dissector.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause Wireshark to enter a large or infinite loop leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Malicious BGP packets or a crafted capture file.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:  An attacker would need to inject malformed BGP packets into the network which is being captured by Wireshark or provide a malformed capture file for Wireshark to process.

**CVE-2018-12086**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow in OPC UA applications, specifically within the dissector, when parsing crafted requests
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  A stack-based buffer overflow due to improperly sized buffers used when parsing OPC UA requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker may trigger a stack overflow by sending carefully structured requests to an affected system running an OPC UA application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitable by a carefully crafted OPC UA requests over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to send malicious OPC UA requests to the target system.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

All these CVEs indicate vulnerabilities within the dissectors in Wireshark. Most of them are triggered by malformed network packets or specially crafted capture files that can cause an infinite loop or a crash. CVE-2018-12086 indicates a stack buffer overflow within OPC UA applications, triggered by malicious requests.

The vulnerabilities generally lead to denial-of-service conditions, with some potentially leading to further code execution. Attackers need to be able to inject malicious packets into networks where Wireshark is being used or provide users with malicious capture files.

The provided information from SUSE and openSUSE also includes which packages and versions are vulnerable and which are patched, offering more specific details related to their distributions.

It's also important to note that some information is from historical bug trackers and mailing lists, providing additional context about the vulnerability's identification and resolution.
