{
  "CVE-2018-14641": {
    "Description": "A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default but non-rare configuration of a victim host an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability was introduced by a change that unions the `sk` and `ip_defrag_offset` fields of the `struct sk_buff`. When a defragmented packet is fragmented, skb_orphan() is called and skb->ip_defrag_offset is set. Because skb->sk and skb->ip_defrag_offset are the same union member, frag->sk is not NULL which causes a crash in the skb->sk check routine in ip_do_fragment().",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of the sk and ip_defrag_offset fields in struct sk_buff during IP fragmentation and reassembly",
      "Signed-unsigned comparison issue"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote denial of service. An attacker can trigger a system crash on a vulnerable host by sending specially crafted fragmented packets.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote network attack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets to the target. Masquerading and forwarding should be configured on a victim host. An attacker can then ping an external host from inside a masqueraded zone, so the malicious ping is masqueraded and forwarded by the victim host."
