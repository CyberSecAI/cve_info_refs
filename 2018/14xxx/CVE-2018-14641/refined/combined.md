| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1629636#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2018-09-17 08:40:17 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default but non-rare configuration of a victim host an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial-of-service.  References:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q3/248>  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5d407b071dc369c26a38398326ee2be53651cfe4>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1629636#c4)  Vladis Dronov    2018-09-17 09:12:34 UTC  ``` Note:  The fix is the upstream commit 5d407b071dc3 ("ip: frags: fix crash in ip_do_fragment()") and it is fixing fa0f527358bd ("ip: use rb trees for IP frag queue."). Namely, the following part of fa0f527358bd which unions sk and ip_defrag_offset fields of struct sk_buff has introduced the vulnerability:  +++ b/include/linux/skbuff.h @@ -676,13 +676,16 @@ struct sk_buff { + +       union { +               struct sock             *sk; +               int                     ip_defrag_offset; +       };  Only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9 LE (the RHEL-ALT product) has backported this part of fa0f527358bd and so is vulnerable to this flaw. Future Linux kernel updates for this product may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1629636#c6)  Vladis Dronov    2018-09-18 10:05:44 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1630279](show_bug.cgi?id=1630279 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2018-14641 kernel: a bug in ip_frag_reasm() can cause a crash in ip_do_fragment() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1629636#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 09:05:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2948)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1629636#c0)  Vladis Dronov    2018-09-17 08:40:17 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment().

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

ip: frags: fix crash in ip\_do\_fragment()A kernel crash occurrs when defragmented packet is fragmented
in ip\_do\_fragment().
In defragment routine, skb\_orphan() is called and
skb->ip\_defrag\_offset is set. but skb->sk and
skb->ip\_defrag\_offset are same union member. so that
frag->sk is not NULL.
Hence crash occurrs in skb->sk check routine in ip\_do\_fragment() when
defragmented packet is fragmented.
test commands:
%iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
%hping3 192.168.4.2 -s 1000 -p 2000 -d 60000

# CVE-2018-14641: Linux kernel: a security flaw in the ip\_frag\_reasm()

---

*From*: Vladis Dronov <vdronov () redhat com>

*Date*: Tue, 18 Sep 2018 06:02:29 -0400 (EDT)

```
Heololo,

A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in
net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel which can cause a later system crash
in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default but non-rare configuration of
a victim host an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a
remote denial-of-service.

The CVE-ID CVE-2018-14641 was assigned to this flaw and we would suggest to use
it in the public communications.

Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1629636>

The flaw was introduced in:

$ git tag --contain fa0f527358bd
v4.19-rc1

and fixed in:

$ git tag --contain 5d407b071dc3
v4.19-rc4

The fix is the upstream commit 5d407b071dc3 ("ip: frags: fix crash in
ip_do_fragment()") and it is fixing fa0f527358bd ("ip: use rb trees for IP frag
queue."). Namely, the following part of fa0f527358bd which unions sk and
ip_defrag_offset fields of struct sk_buff has introduced the vulnerability:

+++ b/include/linux/skbuff.h
@@ -676,13 +676,16 @@ struct sk_buff {
+
+       union {
+               struct sock             *sk;
+               int                     ip_defrag_offset;
+       };

Distributions which has backported this part of fa0f527358bd (which in turn is
a part of the fix of the CVE-2018-5391/FragmentSmack) are vulnerable.

For the remote attack masquerading and forwarding should be configured on a
victim host. Then an attacker can ping an external host from inside a
masqueraded zone, so that the malicious ping is masqueraded and forwarded by a
victim host. This is not default but (we believe) not rare configuration, so
for example, a VM hosting provider could be vulnerable.

Best regards,
Vladis Dronov | Red Hat, Inc. | Product Security Engineer

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
