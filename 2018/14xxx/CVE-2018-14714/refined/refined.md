**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution as root.
- In the provided example, an attacker can start a telnetd instance as root on port 8383, gaining shell access.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with the `load_script` hook and embedding arbitrary commands within it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be authenticated on the router's web interface to exploit this vulnerability.
