```
An HFS+ filesystem can be mounted read-only without having a metadata
directory, which is needed to support hardlinks. But if the catalog data
is corrupted, a directory lookup may still find dentries claiming to be
hardlinks.

hfsplus_lookup() does check that ->hidden_dir is not NULL in such a
situation, but mistakenly does so after dereferencing it for the first
time. Reorder this check to prevent a crash.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-13053](/security/CVE-2018-13053))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to

construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13096](/security/CVE-2018-13096))

Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that the btrfs filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle relocations in

some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs

image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-14609](/security/CVE-2018-14609))

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel on ARM

64bit processors did not properly handle some ioctls. An attacker with the

privilege to create KVM-based virtual machines could use this to cause a

denial of service (host system crash) or execute arbitrary code in the

host. ([CVE-2018-18021](/security/CVE-2018-18021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

It was discovered that a use-after-free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when certain failure conditions occurred. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20856](/security/CVE-2018-20856))

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilty existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12818](/security/CVE-2019-12818))

It was discovered that the MDIO bus devices subsystem in the Linux kernel

improperly dropped a device reference in an error condition, leading to a

use-after-free. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-12819](/security/CVE-2019-12819))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the

virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.

([CVE-2019-3900](/security/CVE-2019-3900))

Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered

that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require

sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-9506](/security/CVE-2019-9506))

It was discovered that the Appletalk IP encapsulation driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly prevent kernel addresses from being copied to user

space. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this to

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-20511](/security/CVE-2018-20511))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the USB YUREX device

driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15216](/security/CVE-2019-15216))

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the

Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A

physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15218](/security/CVE-2019-15218))

It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate data size information from the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15221](/security/CVE-2019-15221))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3821-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-13053](/security/CVE-2018-13053))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to

construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13096](/security/CVE-2018-13096))

Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that the btrfs filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle relocations in

some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs

image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-14609](/security/CVE-2018-14609))

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel on ARM

64bit processors did not properly handle some ioctls. An attacker with the

privilege to create KVM-based virtual machines could use this to cause a

denial of service (host system crash) or execute arbitrary code in the

host. ([CVE-2018-18021](/security/CVE-2018-18021))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
