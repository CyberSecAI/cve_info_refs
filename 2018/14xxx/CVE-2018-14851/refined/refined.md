Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-14851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability within the `exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE()` function in the `ext/exif/exif.c` file in PHP. This function is responsible for processing EXIF data within a JPEG's MakerNote section. The vulnerability stems from improper offset calculation when processing IFD (Image File Directory) data within a MakerNote, where `offset_base` is modified but the `IFDlength` and `displacement` are not updated accordingly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read data beyond the allocated buffer. This can occur when processing crafted JPEG files due to the mishandling of offsets and lengths within the `exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE()` function.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** Due to inconsistent offset calculations, the function attempts to read data outside the bounds of the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause PHP to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** An out-of-bounds read could potentially leak limited amounts of memory, although the primary impact is DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JPEG image, particularly one with a malformed MakerNote section.
- **Crafted File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted JPEG file containing malicious EXIF data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the processing of a crafted JPEG image.
- **No specific privileges:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges or access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in PHP versions before 5.6.37, 7.0.31, 7.1.20, and 7.2.8.
- Patches have been made available in the mentioned versions.
- The issue is related to how PHP processes EXIF tags, specifically in the MakerNote section.
- Some sources describe it as a buffer over-read, while others identify it as an out-of-bounds read; they both refer to the same root cause.
- The vulnerability is described as a low priority and low severity by Red Hat.
- Red Hat states that the upstream project does not consider this a security issue due to it relying on misconfiguration, where a memory limit is not defined. However, Red Hat chose to address it.

The information provided is consistent across the multiple sources, indicating that the core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE()` function in PHP that can cause a DoS by exploiting a specially crafted JPEG file.
