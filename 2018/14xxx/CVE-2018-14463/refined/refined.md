{
  "CVE-2018-14463": {
    "Description": "The VRRP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-vrrp.c:vrrp_print().",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer over-read exists in the `vrrp_print()` function within `print-vrrp.c` when parsing VRRP packets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets that when printed by tcpdump will cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send crafted VRRP packets to the vulnerable system running `tcpdump`."
