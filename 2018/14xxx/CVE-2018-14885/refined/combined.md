## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32512#issue-430456776)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-12

Incorrect access control in the database manager component in Odoo Community 10.0 and 11.0 and Odoo Enterprise 10.0 and 11.0 allows a remote attacker to restore a database dump without knowing the super-admin password. An arbitrary password succeeds.

**Affects**: Odoo 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Database Manager

**Credits**: Yenthe Van Ginneken and Erwin van der Ploeg (Odoo Experts)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14885](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14885)

## I. Background

Odoo provides an interface to manage databases, and create, backup and restore

databases, in order to ease testing and development tasks.

Access to these sensitive operations is normally protected by a super-admin

password, chosen by the system administrator.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error in the database restore feature rendered the super-admin

password protection ineffective.

## III. Impact

Access Vector: Network exploitable

Access Complexity: Low

**Authentication**: Public

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 8.2

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)

When the database manager screen is not deactivated, an attacker could restore

a database backup without knowning the super-admin password. This would allow

the injection of data, and the execution of requests on the server with

local database administration privileges.

On a properly configured server, this could degrade the performance

of the targeted server without gaining any access on the other databases

on the server.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

Only servers with the database manager enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

On production servers, deactivating the database manager will prevent attackers

from abusing the issue, and is strongly recommended.

See also the Odoo Deployment Guide:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/deploy.html>

Revoking database creation rights for the PostgreSQL user configured for the

Odoo service will also prevent the attack.

Odoo Cloud servers are not vulnerable to this issue, because the database

manager is not enabled.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 10.0: [b020308](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/b0203084133bee0dadc004debf3b0fb2835d0ffd)
* 11.0: [5decf4a](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/5decf4ab3da7484f8418d648688fbe4250ea7fdd)
* 11.0-ent and 10.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0 and 10.0.

The version 9.0 is not impacted by this vulnerability.

* #### [[IMP] odoo: add config for cron connection time](/odoo/odoo/commit/e140c934621ab99f2a522318dd7513b0751258c0 "[IMP] odoo: add config for cron connection time Adds a configuration that can be used to mitigate PostgreSQL transactional errors with long-living connections and the `LISTEN/NOTIFY`[1] functionality by re-establishing the database connection periodically. In the case that a connection outlives the transaction wraparound[2] mechanism of postgres, the `LISTEN/NOTIFY` internal queue might contain references to transactions that have already been deleted by the system's (or a manual) `VACUUM`[3] as it has its own transaction validity mechanisms (roughly comparing transaction ids). This can be reproduced by: - Triggering a wraparound _AND_ cleaning of pg_xact between the cron's `LISTEN` + `COMMIT` and its recyling. - Having done at least one `NOTIFY` during that time period (?). - Try to `LISTEN` to the same channel on the same database (transaction id must be < than the first connection's transaction id). The following is an example error message: ``` ERROR database odoo.service.server: Worker (3194772) Exception occurred, exiting...

This happens because `handleObserverRecords` calls `updateHints`, which relies on `getSelectionData`. However, `this.activeSelection` retains the outdated selection due to conditions like `documentSelectionIsInEditable` and `!this.activeSelection.anchorNode.isConnected` being `false`. As a result, `this.activeSelection` reflects `a[b]` while the DOM selection has already updated to `a[]`, leading to invalid offsets. **Solution**: Call `this.dependencies.selection.focusEditable();` during `onSelect` to ensure the selection is updated to reflect the editor state rather than the mention state. **Steps to Reproduce**: 1. Open the chatter. 2. Add some text. 3. Select a portion of the text. 4. Type `@`. 5. Select an item (person) from the mention list. 6.

* #### [[FIX] core: module state may be incorrect after successful installation](/odoo/odoo/commit/306671c2bd2474c7f19bea64fd6ad96b4a020c56 "[FIX] core: module state may be incorrect after successful installation Given the following module hierarchy: <pre> ... \_ test_install_base \_ test_install_auto \_ test_install_fail </pre> Where: * The auto-installed module has (for sake of example) some a model override of `ResCurrency` that defines a new method for the class. This module also has some data that defines an `IrCron` record, which executes the method added by the `ResCurrency` override within its own model files. * The data error module has a view extension which has some bad syntax that will trigger a failure in `load_data()`. Upon running an odoo instance with `-i test_install_fail`, the registry loading will proceed until failing at this module. As expected, the module test_install_auto has been installed just before the failing one. The CRON data loaded from test_install_auto is in the database. However, the module itself is not marked as 'installed', and the cron will fail to execute, since the module test_install_auto is not loaded by the registry. The problem occurs because a package's data/schema changes are committed prior to actually marking the module record as 'installed'. Moreover, the module's state change is not committed right away, which causes that change to be part of the next module's loading transaction. When the module test_install_fail fails to install, the current transaction is rolled back, and the module's state is reset to 'uninstalled'. Because the state change of module test_install_auto is part of the rolled back transaction, that module remains in state 'to install', and is eventually also reset to 'uninstalled'. Because of this, we are left with a CRON record from test_install_auto, but the latter is not loaded by the registry. This causes the CRON to fail to execute, because of a missing method used by the CRON. closes odoo/odoo#194625 X-original-commit: 0e72fca3617edf1f1eb7ae012bcdccb73c460ff6 Signed-off-by: Raphael Collet <rco@odoo.com> Signed-off-by: Vincent Ethan <etvi@odoo.com>")
