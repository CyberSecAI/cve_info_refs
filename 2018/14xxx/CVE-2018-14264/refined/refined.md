User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the importAnFDF method. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process."
