{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The optional DroboPix application's tusd server implementation fails to ensure that uploaded files are placed in a safe location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper file location handling during upload"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file upload to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, leading to potential Remote Code Execution by uploading malicious PHP files to web-accessible locations.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to initiate the upload, including a base64-encoded filename with a relative path in the 'Upload-Metadata' header to perform path traversal, followed by a PATCH request with the file contents to the previously generated UUID to upload the file to an arbitrary location.",
    "required_capabilities": "Network access to the device and knowledge of the tus upload protocol is required to exploit this vulnerability. A valid device ID is needed, although it can be obtained using other vulnerabilities."
