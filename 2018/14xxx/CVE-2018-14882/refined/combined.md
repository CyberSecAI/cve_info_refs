## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.9.3-0ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.9.3-0ubuntu0.18.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.9.3-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.9.3-0ubuntu0.16.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes. In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary

changes.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in tcpdump, a command-line
network traffic analyzer. These vulnerabilities might result in denial of
service or, potentially, execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.9.3-1~deb9u1.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.3-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.

Debian Bug     : 941698

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in tcpdump, a
command-line network traffic analyzer. These security vulnerabilities
might result in denial of service or, potentially, execution of
arbitrary code.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.3-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
