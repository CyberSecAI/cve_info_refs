Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap overflow within the `mp4v2::impl::MP4Integer32Property::Read` function.
*   This heap overflow is triggered when parsing a crafted MP4 file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:** A buffer allocated on the heap is overwritten.
*   **Uncontrolled Write:** The overflow allows an attacker to overwrite parts of the heap, including the virtual table pointer (vtable ptr).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** By overwriting the vtable ptr, the attacker can control the execution flow when the overwritten vtable is used later.
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash itself can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to control the execution flow via vtable overwriting could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MP4 File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a maliciously crafted MP4 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Creation/Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an MP4 file to include the malicious data triggering the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the crafted MP4 file using an application that uses the vulnerable libmp4v2 library.

**Additional Information**
* The fix for this vulnerability is included in libmp4v2 version 2.1.0
* This vulnerability was addressed in Fedora 29, 30, and 31 updates

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-14446 is a heap overflow vulnerability in the libmp4v2 library, specifically affecting the processing of crafted MP4 files. By overflowing the heap and corrupting the vtable pointer, an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution, though the most immediate impact is a crash. The vulnerability is triggered by opening a crafted MP4 file, and the required capability is being able to create or modify such files.
