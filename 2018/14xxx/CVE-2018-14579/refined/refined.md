{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The installer directory (`/install/`) is not removed after installation, allowing an attacker to re-initiate the installation process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to remove or disable the installation functionality after initial setup.",
      "Lack of input sanitization in the `Table prefix` field of the installation form.",
      "Exposure of default SQL file (`install/install.sql`)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can reinstall the application and overwrite the existing configuration, potentially gaining complete control of the application. Arbitrary code execution is possible by injecting PHP code into the configuration.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the installation page (`/install/`)",
      "Submitting malicious input to the `Table prefix` field during re-installation.",
      "Accessing the default SQL file (`/install/install.sql`)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the application. No prior authentication is required. The attacker also requires knowledge of the MySQL password to perform the full reinstallation, however, this can be bypassed with SQL injection."
