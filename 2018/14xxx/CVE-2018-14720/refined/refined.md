Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `jackson-databind` library's failure to properly block certain JDK (Java Development Kit) classes during polymorphic deserialization. This allows for an attacker to supply malicious inputs that would cause the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Polymorphic Deserialization:** The vulnerability exists because `jackson-databind` does not prevent the deserialization of certain classes, which can be used to trigger malicious behavior. Specifically, it allows the deserialization of certain JDK classes that can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exfiltration:** Successful exploitation can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive information via XML External Entity attacks.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Depending on the classes used for polymorphic deserialization, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the target server. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** This is a network-based attack, as it involves sending malicious input data to a vulnerable application over the network.
*   **Polymorphic Deserialization:** Attackers can send crafted JSON messages containing malicious class names and serialized data. When `jackson-databind` attempts to deserialize this data using polymorphic typing, it can instantiate and execute the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No authentication required:** The attack can be performed without any user privileges or interaction

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by blocking specific JDK classes from polymorphic deserialization, which prevents exploitation through known vectors
*   The vulnerability is specifically related to improper handling of polymorphic deserialization when using features such as `enableDefaultTyping()`.
*   The fix involves adding problematic classes to a blacklist, preventing their instantiation during deserialization.
* This is often related to improper handling of JAX-WS, slf4j, or flex classes via polymorphic deserialization.

The provided content highlights that this CVE impacts various Red Hat products which use the vulnerable `jackson-databind` library. It emphasizes the importance of applying the available patches, as the impact can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution. The updates involved fixing the `jackson-databind` library by adding specific vulnerable classes to a blacklist.
