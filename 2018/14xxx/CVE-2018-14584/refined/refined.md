The provided content describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the Bento4 library, specifically when processing MP4 files. The issue is triggered during the parsing of the Avcc atom. While there are two issues reported, they share the same root cause and affected code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-buffer-overflow in the `AP4_AvccAtom::Create` function (located in `Ap4AvccAtom.cpp:88`). This occurs while processing data from an MP4 file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The program terminates due to the AddressSanitizer (ASan) detecting the heap-buffer-overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Although not explicitly stated, a heap overflow can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully crafts a malicious MP4 file and has a way to influence program execution flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 file: The attack vector is a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers the overflow in `AP4_AvccAtom::Create` during parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious MP4 file to the application (`mp4info` or `mp4dump`).
- No special privileges required besides the ability to execute the application.

**Additional details:**
- The crash occurs when `mp4info` and `mp4dump` are run on crafted input files.
- The AddressSanitizer output provides detailed information about the location of the overflow, the call stack, and the allocated memory region.
- The specific input files triggering the issues are located at the provided URLs:
    - `https://github.com/fCorleone/fuzz_programs/blob/master/Bento4/test12.dms` (for `mp4info`)
    - `https://github.com/fCorleone/fuzz_programs/blob/master/Bento4/test6` (for `mp4dump`)
- The overflow occurs during the processing of an `AP4_AvccAtom` during the parsing of an MP4 file's sample description (`stsd`) atom.
- The vulnerable code is in the `AP4_AvccAtom::Create` function located in `Bento4/Source/C++/Core/Ap4AvccAtom.cpp` at line 88.
