{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sddm display manager, when configured with `ReuseSession=true`, did not properly check authentication when unlocking existing sessions. Specifically, if a user had an existing session, the password was not checked before unlocking the session.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication check",
       "Missing authentication for unlocking existing sessions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the system dbus could unlock any graphical session without providing the correct password.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs access to the system dbus.",
    "required_capabilities": "Access to the system dbus is required to exploit this vulnerability."
  },
  "fix": {
    "commit_details": "The fix involves two primary changes:\n 1. **Check the success value before unlocking:**  The code was changed to verify the success of the authentication attempt before proceeding to unlock the session.\n 2. **Removed the attempt to use the non-existent 'sddm-check' PAM service:**  The code was updated to not use the `sddm-check` PAM service, which did not exist.",
