## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32506#issue-430456630)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-6

Improper data access control in Odoo Community 10.0 and 11.0 and Odoo Enterprise 10.0 and 11.0 allows authenticated users to perform a CSV export of the secure hashed passwords of other users.

**Affects**: Odoo 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Odoo Framework

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz), Swapnesh Shah

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14861](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14861)

## I. Background

As of Odoo 8.0, when local passwords are used, the passwords are stored

by default as salted cryptographic hashes (derived via PBKDF2 using

SHA-512 hashing).

In order to protect the cryptographic hashes from being accessed by

users, a special security rule prevents reading the fields where the

password hashes are stored.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error made this special security rule ineffective when

the CSV/Excel export mechanism is used.

This is a regression of the correction for Security Advisory

2016-04a-password-export.

## III. Impact

Access Vector: Network exploitable

Access Complexity: Low

**Authentication**: "Employee" access required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 4.3

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

By using the CSV export functionality, users with internal "Employee" access

might export the password hashes of other database users, including

those of privileged users.

Exploiting these password hashes to retrieve user passwords is difficult

but not necessarily impossible, for example in the presence of weak

passwords or passwords that may be subject to dictionary attacks.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

No workaround is available, but users that are exclusively authenticated

via remote authentication methods such as LDAP (auth\_ldap) are not vulnerable,

as they have no local password.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 10.0: [0dbed81](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/0dbed816b90db5be06c60bf0e4a74411c9cf962e)
* 11.0: [698314e](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/698314e5d4c145c0b7b9fc323fccc7c3a19de0fc)
* 11.0-ent and 10.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0 and 10.0.

Version 9.0 is not impacted by this vulnerability.
