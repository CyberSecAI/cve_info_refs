The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14861.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A programming error made a special security rule ineffective when the CSV/Excel export mechanism was used. This rule was intended to prevent reading fields containing password hashes. This is a regression of a previous correction for Security Advisory 2016-04a-password-export.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper data access control: The system failed to properly enforce access restrictions when exporting data via CSV or Excel, allowing unauthorized access to password hashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of password hashes: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to export the secure hashed passwords of other users, including privileged accounts.
- Potential for password compromise: While retrieving the original passwords from the hashes is not guaranteed, weak or commonly used passwords could be exposed through dictionary attacks or other cracking methods.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network exploitable.
- Attackers must have internal "Employee" access.
- Exploitation is achieved by using the CSV export functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated "Employee" access to the Odoo system.
