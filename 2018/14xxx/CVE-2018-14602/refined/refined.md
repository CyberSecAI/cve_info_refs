- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The monitor.gitlab.net instance exposes private information due to how it accesses data. Specifically, it mirrors dashboards that contain sensitive data (like project names and CI build counts for private projects). Additionally, the Prometheus instance that feeds data to the monitor.gitlab.net is publicly accessible.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Public exposure of private project information (names, CI build counts).
    - Public access to the Prometheus instance.
    - Potential for unintentional future exposure of private data due to the way monitor.gitlab.net accesses its data.
    - Insecure Grafana access which allows for direct querying of Prometheus data.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Exposure of private project names and CI build counts, which could be sensitive information.
    - Potential for further exploitation due to publicly accessible Prometheus instance.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Accessing mirrored dashboards on monitor.gitlab.net.
    - Directly querying the publicly available Prometheus instance, even through Grafana.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - No specific capabilities are required as the mentioned resources are publicly accessible. An attacker needs only an internet connection and knowledge of the resource locations.
