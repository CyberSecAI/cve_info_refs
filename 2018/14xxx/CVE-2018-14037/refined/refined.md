Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in the sanitization logic of the Kendo UI Editor when handling specific payloads within the `editorNS.Serializer.htmlToDom()` function. While the function attempts to sanitize some XSS vectors like `<script>` tags, it fails to detect and sanitize data URI payloads. This allows malicious JavaScript to be injected into the DOM of the WYSIWYG editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the lack of thorough sanitization for HTML content being processed by the Kendo UI Editor.  Specifically, it does not properly handle data URIs.
*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, where malicious content is stored within the editor's context. This stored payload can then be executed when a user accesses the editor or if the unsanitized content is used elsewhere in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Kendo UI Editor.
*   **User Session Hijacking:** If the injected payload is reflected in other resources that depend on the editor's sanitization, an attacker could potentially take over user sessions. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected user's account and data.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to steal sensitive information, manipulate displayed data, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Payload Injection:** Attackers inject malicious payloads through the Kendo UI Editor's input, leveraging the vulnerable sanitization function.
*   **Data URI Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a data URI containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Access to Editor:** The attacker needs to have the ability to input content into the Kendo UI Editor.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Payloads**:  The attacker needs to utilize payloads such as data URIs, which are not adequately sanitized by the editor.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Version:** The specific vulnerable version is v2018.1.221 of the Progress Kendo UI Editor.
*   **Workaround:** The vendor has not provided a fix but recommends a workaround involving custom sanitization using the `serialization.custom` and `deserialization.custom` options. This workaround requires developers to manually sanitize input using a function like the one provided in the advisory example.  The provided example removes `object` elements, but the advisory notes the need to extend this to handle other vulnerable payloads.
*   **Proof-of-Concept Payloads:** The advisory provides the following sample payloads that can trigger the XSS:
    *   `<object data="data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgic2VjdGVzdCIpPC9zY3JpcHQ+"></object>`
    *   `<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>`
    *   `<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K">`
*   **Vendor Communication:** The advisory outlines a timeline of communications with the vendor, including a delayed response and a request for customers to file support tickets.  The vendor did not provide a patch but did provide a workaround.
