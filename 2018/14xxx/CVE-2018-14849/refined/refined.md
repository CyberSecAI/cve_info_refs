The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14849 and CVE-2018-14850. This analysis focuses on the information relevant to CVE-2018-14849.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability in Tiki versions 18.1 and earlier. This vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data when handling links or thumbnail images on a wiki page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the application and stored persistently. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of another user's browser.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user input when creating links and thumbnails on wiki pages, allowing the injection of JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An authenticated user can inject JavaScript code. If an administrator views a page containing this malicious script and hovers the mouse over the affected link or thumb image, the injected JavaScript executes. This can result in an attacker gaining administrator privileges.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Through the injected JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the administrator's browser, potentially allowing them to perform malicious actions on the Tiki application.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers could potentially modify content, steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Wiki Pages: The attack vector is through the manipulation of wiki pages by injecting JavaScript code into links or thumb images.
- Mouse Hover: The XSS payload is triggered when an administrator hovers their mouse over a malicious link or thumb image on a wiki page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to have an authenticated account to be able to create or modify wiki pages, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
- User Interaction: The vulnerability requires an administrator to view the manipulated wiki page and hover the mouse over the malicious link or thumb image.
