The provided content details five distinct heap-based buffer overflow and out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the HDF5 library, version 1.8.20.

**Vulnerability 1: `H5O_fill_new_decode` Heap Buffer Overflow**
   - **Root Cause:** The `H5O_fill_new_decode` function copies data into a buffer allocated based on a size read from the input file. If the size value is manipulated in a crafted HDF5 file to be large, and not checked against available memory, then `HDmemcpy` will write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
   - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `H5O_fill_new_decode` due to unchecked size from the input file.
    - **Impact:** Crash or potential for arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HDF5 file.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a specially crafted HDF5 file and have it parsed.

**Vulnerability 2: `H5O_layout_decode` Heap Buffer Overflow**
   - **Root Cause:** Similar to the first vulnerability, `H5O_layout_decode` reads a size from the input to allocate and copy to a buffer. When `mesg->storage.u.compact.size` is maliciously large,  `HDmemcpy` copies more data than available in buffer `mesg->storage.u.compact.buf`, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
   - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `H5O_layout_decode` due to unchecked size from the input file.
   -  **Impact:** Crash or potential for arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HDF5 file.
   -  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a specially crafted HDF5 file and have it parsed.

**Vulnerability 3: `H5O_pline_reset` Out-of-Bounds Read**
   - **Root Cause:** The `H5O_pline_reset` function attempts to read data from a location calculated based on a value from input. An out-of-bounds read occurs when this calculated location is outside the allocated region.
   - **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read in `H5O_pline_reset`.
    - **Impact:** Crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV).
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HDF5 file.
    - **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a specially crafted HDF5 file and have it parsed.

**Vulnerability 4: `H5T_copy` Heap Buffer Overflow**
   - **Root Cause:** The function `H5T_copy` copies memory based on a size from the input file.  If the size is maliciously crafted to be much larger than the allocated memory it leads to a heap-buffer-overflow via `memcpy`.
   - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `H5T_copy` due to unchecked size from the input file during copy operation.
    - **Impact:** Crash or potential for arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HDF5 file.
    -  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a specially crafted HDF5 file and have it parsed.

**Vulnerability 5: `H5VM_memcpyvv` Heap Buffer Overflow**
   - **Root Cause:** The `H5VM_memcpyvv` function copies data based on lengths read from the file. A large size causes the memcpy to write beyond the allocated buffer.
   - **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `H5VM_memcpyvv` due to unchecked size from the input file.
   -  **Impact:** Crash or potential for arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HDF5 file.
   -  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create a specially crafted HDF5 file and have it parsed.
