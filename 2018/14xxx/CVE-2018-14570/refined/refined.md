Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient file type validation within the member profile avatar upload functionality of Niushop B2B2C Multi-business basic version V1.11.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate File Type Validation:** While the system checks the `Content-Type` and file size, it relies on the client-provided filename extension. The system extracts the file extension from the original filename and appends it to the renamed uploaded file, even though the content of the file may not correspond to the extension.
*   **Lack of Extension Validation:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize file extensions, allowing an attacker to upload files with a `.php` extension.
*   **Predictable File Naming:** Even though the filename is renamed, the system keeps the original extension which is then used to append to the new file name, making it possible to guess the location of the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file (webshell), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the web server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to full system compromise or data theft, allowing further malicious activities.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface using the member profile avatar upload functionality.
*   **File Upload:** The attack relies on uploading a specifically crafted malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Niushop system.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Niushop web application.
*   **HTTP Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the file upload HTTP request and modify the filename to include a `.php` extension.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content provides a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC), showing how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The PoC outlines the steps to register a user, access the member profile, and modify the upload request to include the malicious `.php` file extension.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `/application/shop/controller/member.php`, specifically between lines 1044 to 1071.
*   The attacker modifies the file extension on the `filename` parameter in the upload request.
