[![@jinyu00](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18465642?v=4&size=48)](/jinyu00)[jinyu00](https://github.com/jinyu00)opened [on Jul 17, 2018](https://github.com/jjanier/axml/issues/1#issue-341892181)

When load the poc file with gdb . I got that It call `CopyData` function to copy file data to memory buf. But the `ap->buf + ap->cur` is out of memory , it could lead crash

```
pwndbg> list
128	}
129
130	static void
131	CopyData(Parser_t *ap, unsigned char * to, size_t size)
132	{
133		memcpy(to, ap->buf + ap->cur, size);
134		ap->cur += size;
135		return;
136	}
137
pwndbg> p/x ap->buf + ap->cur
$6 = 0x3f05320
