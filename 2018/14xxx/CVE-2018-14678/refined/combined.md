Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary HFS+ volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Details

USN-3931-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS and for the Linux Azure kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered that the kernel did not

properly set up all arguments to an error handler callback used when

running as a paravirtualized guest. An unprivileged attacker in a

paravirtualized guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest

VM crash). ([CVE-2018-14678](/security/CVE-2018-14678))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel on ARM

64bit processors did not properly handle some ioctls. An attacker with the

privilege to create KVM-based virtual machines could use this to cause a

denial of service (host system crash) or execute arbitrary code in the

host. ([CVE-2018-18021](/security/CVE-2018-18021))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was

insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-7308](/security/CVE-2019-7308))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user-

space API for crypto (af\_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-8912](/security/CVE-2019-8912))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory

when handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).

([CVE-2019-8980](/security/CVE-2019-8980))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered that the kernel did not

properly set up all arguments to an error handler callback used when

running as a paravirtualized guest. An unprivileged attacker in a

paravirtualized guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (guest

VM crash). ([CVE-2018-14678](/security/CVE-2018-14678))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel on ARM

64bit processors did not properly handle some ioctls. An attacker with the

privilege to create KVM-based virtual machines could use this to cause a

denial of service (host system crash) or execute arbitrary code in the

host. ([CVE-2018-18021](/security/CVE-2018-18021))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was

insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-7308](/security/CVE-2019-7308))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user-

space API for crypto (af\_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-8912](/security/CVE-2019-8912))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory

when handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).

([CVE-2019-8980](/security/CVE-2019-8980))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-14678 / XSA-274
                               version 3

      Linux: Uninitialized state in x86 PV failsafe callback path

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Fix spelling in CREDITS.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Linux has a `failsafe` callback, invoked by Xen under certain
conditions.  Normally in this failsafe callback, error_entry is paired
with error_exit; and error_entry uses %ebx to communicate to
error_exit whether to use the user or kernel return path.

Unfortunately, on 64-bit PV Xen on x86, error_exit is called without
error_entry being called first, leaving %ebx with an invalid value.

IMPACT
======

A rogue user-space program could crash a guest kernel.  Privilege
escalation cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only 64-bit x86 PV Linux systems are vulnerable.

All versions of Linux are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Switching to HVM or PVH guests will mitigate this issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by M. Vefa Bicakci, and recognized as a
security issue by Andy Lutomirski.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

NB this patch has not been accepted into Linux upstream yet.  An
updated advisory will be sent if the fix upstreamed looks
significantly different.
