Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the issue reported which appears to be related to a crash in `mp42hls` which may be related to CVE-2018-14586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurring within the `AP4_Mpeg2TsAudioSampleStream::WriteSample` function in the `Ap4Mpeg2Ts.cpp` file. This occurs during the processing of an audio sample while converting an MP4 file to HLS format using the `mp42hls` tool. The specific memory address causing the fault is `0x00000000000c`, which likely represents an invalid memory access, dereferencing a null or corrupted pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference or Invalid Memory Access:** The crash indicates a likely null pointer dereference or some other form of invalid memory access while trying to write the audio sample.
- **Input Validation:**  The issue might stem from insufficient input validation or handling of malformed MP4 files leading to unexpected states in the `AP4_Mpeg2TsAudioSampleStream::WriteSample` function which causes it to dereference an invalid pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the `mp42hls` tool. An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted MP4 file as input.
- **Potential Further Exploitation:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly show more than a crash, such invalid memory access vulnerabilities could be indicative of more serious issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious MP4 File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted MP4 file which triggers the vulnerability in `mp42hls` during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a file to be processed by the vulnerable `mp42hls` tool. This would typically mean the attacker could:
    - Provide a crafted file to a service which uses this tool.
    - Control the input to a machine using the tool.

**Additional details:**
- The provided ASAN output gives the specific function call stack leading to the error, highlighting the exact location in the `AP4_Mpeg2TsAudioSampleStream::WriteSample` function that triggers the issue.
- The input file to reproduce the crash is provided via a link to a Github Gist.
- The issue was identified via fuzzing.
