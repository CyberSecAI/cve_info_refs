{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `batchTransfer` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The total amount of tokens to be transferred is calculated by multiplying the number of receivers with the value to be transferred, which can lead to an integer overflow.",
      "Insufficient validation of the calculated amount before deducting it from the sender's balance."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit the integer overflow to transfer a small amount of tokens from their balance but effectively mint a large amount of tokens to the receiver addresses. This allows the attacker to increase their token holdings and potentially manipulate the token value.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Calling the `batchTransfer` function with a crafted array of receiver addresses and a specific value. An attacker needs to control the number of recipients and the transfer value.",
        "Specifically, an attacker can transfer tokens to multiple addresses and set the transfer value such that the multiplication of `_receivers.length` and `_value` will result in an integer overflow."

    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable function `batchTransfer` and have some tokens to transfer in the first place."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided document also contains several links and code snippets for other cryptocurrencies that have similar integer overflow vulnerabilities in their transfer functions. These include Malaysia coins (Xmc), MP3 Coin(MP3), Neo Genesis Token (NGT), WeMediaChain (WMC), Rocket Coin (XRC) and GlobeCoin (GLB)."
