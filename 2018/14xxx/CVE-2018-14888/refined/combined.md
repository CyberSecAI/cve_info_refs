# Exploit Title: MyBB Thank You/Like Plugin 3.0.0 - Cross-Site Scripting
# Date: 8/1/2018
# Author: 0xB9
# Twitter: @0xB9Sec
# Contact: 0xB9[at]pm.me
# Software Link: https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=360
# Version: 3.0.0
# Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04
# CVE: CVE-2018-14888

1. Description:
This plugin allows users to thank/like other users threads/posts. In user profiles it shows your most liked post/thread, the post/thread subjects aren't sanitized to user input.

2. Proof of Concept:

- Use the following as the post/thread subject  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Get that post/thread liked by another user (or you)
- Visit your profile to see alert.

3. Solution:
Update to v3.1.0

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Complete changelog:

[Release v3.4.5 · mybbgroup/Thank-you-like-system (github.com)](https://github.com/mybbgroup/Thank-you-like-system/releases/tag/v3.4.5)

### Version 3.4.4 stable Build #39

[FIXED] PHP 8.x compatibility

[FIXED] Member profile page - thank you/like box - parse text correctly

Thank you @SvePu !!!

### Version 3.4.3 stable Build #38

[ENHANCEMENT] - Declare $post as a global variable in the memprofile hook-in function, for compatibility with other plugins

### Version 3.4.2 stable Build #37

[FIX] - thankyoulike\_member\_link template is not cached

### Version 3.4.1 stable Build #36

[FIX] - Remove creation of new indexes from auto-upgrade

Thank you @lairdshaw

### Version 3.4.0 stable Build #35

[ENHANCEMENT] - Add a warning for MyAlerts < 2.0.4

[FIX] - Some alerts show the wrong count of new tyls

[FIX] - The creation of the new indexes might time out

Important note: If you have integrated the Thank You/Like System with MyAlerts, you should, after upgrade, run (Re)initialise last alerted thank/like for each post in the ACP under Tools & Maintenance => Recount & Rebuild.

Why? This fixes a bug applicable to our earlier enhancement of alerts. The enhancement was the inclusion of an indication of how many new thanks/likes there have been since the last alert viewed for that post. The bug is that for posts thanked or liked before that enhancement, alerts will (for the thanked/liked post's first alert after the enhancement) count all thanks/likes as new, even when an alert (prior to the enhancement) had already been viewed for prior thanks/likes.

Thank you @lairdshaw for your contribution!
