{
  "CVE-2018-14888": {
    "Root cause": "The MyBB Thank You/Like Plugin does not sanitize user-provided input for post/thread subjects, leading to stored XSS.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers by injecting malicious code into post or thread subjects. This could lead to account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker creates a post or thread with a malicious script in the subject, then a user visits their profile where their 'most liked' post/thread is displayed, triggering the XSS.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create posts/threads and have them liked by at least one user. No special privileges are needed beyond a normal forum user's capabilities."
