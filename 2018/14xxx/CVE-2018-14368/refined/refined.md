{
  "CVE-2018-14368": {
    "Root cause": "The Bazaar protocol dissector in Wireshark could enter an infinite loop due to improper handling of long items.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of long items in the Bazaar protocol dissector, leading to an infinite loop."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malformed packet or capture file can cause Wireshark to enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network injection of a malformed packet",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft malformed Bazaar protocol packets or manipulate existing packet traces to include them. No authentication is required."
  }
