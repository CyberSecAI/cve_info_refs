Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of origin validation in the websocket server of `parcel-bundler`. Additionally, the static server lacks a general hostname flag to restrict CORS, making it vulnerable to the same issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Origin Validation:** The websocket server does not check the origin of incoming requests, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Lack of CORS Restriction:** The static server does not have a mechanism to enforce CORS restrictions, making it vulnerable to cross-origin attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal source code by making requests to the vulnerable websocket server or static server from a different origin.
- **Security Risks:** Running parcel on a server without proper CORS restrictions exposes the server to security risks, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Origin Requests:** An attacker could make cross-origin requests to the websocket or static server from a malicious website or application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to send requests to the vulnerable server from a different origin, e.g., through a web browser.
- The attacker would need knowledge of the running instance to target the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

The fix involves validating the origin of requests in the websocket server. Also, the fix introduces a new `--hostname` flag that applies CORS restrictions to both the static and websocket servers, effectively resolving the vulnerability and ensuring secure operation of `parcel-bundler` on a server.
