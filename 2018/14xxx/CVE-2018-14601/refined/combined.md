# Slow rendering of markdown files and issue descriptions with lots of Markdown references

[From slack discussion: <https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02PF508L/p1531998709000235>]

Opening markdown files (for example: <https://gitlab.com/charts/gitlab/blob/master/doc/installation/deployment.md>) takes too much time since last few days. The page loads quickly,but the markdown content is taking noticeable time to appear. It's happening also while updating issues with lots of Markdown references

Inspecting the network, I see `https://gitlab.com/charts/gitlab/blob/master/doc/installation/deployment.md?format=json&viewer=rich` took most of the time: `15363ms`
