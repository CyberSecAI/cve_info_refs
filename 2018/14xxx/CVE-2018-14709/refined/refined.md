{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-14709",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The API used between the Drobo Dashboard and NASd makes use of the deviceâ€™s serial number as a form of authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient authentication: Using the device's serial number as the sole authentication method."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and perform arbitrary actions on a targeted Drobo device by obtaining the device's serial number. This allows an attacker to perform any command otherwise performed by the Drobo Dashboard.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network access to the device on port 5000 (nc <device ip> 5000) to obtain the serial number."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Network access to the Drobo device.",
        "Ability to connect to port 5000 using netcat."
