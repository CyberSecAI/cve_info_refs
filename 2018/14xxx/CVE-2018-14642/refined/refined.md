  "CVE-2018-14642": {
    "vulnerability_description": "In some circumstances Undertow can serve data from a random ByteBuffer, this is due to an incomplete fix for UNDERTOW-438.  Basically if all the headers are not written out in the first write() call then the code that handles flushing the buffer will always write out the full contents of the writevBuffer buffer, which may contain data from previous requests.",
    "root_cause": "An incomplete fix for UNDERTOW-438 resulted in the code that handles flushing the buffer always writing out the full contents of the writevBuffer buffer, which may contain data from previous requests, when all headers are not written out in the first write() call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Information Leak, where Undertow can serve data from a random buffer. This can lead to an exposure of sensitive information from previous requests.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered during normal web server operations when all the headers are not written out in the first write() call.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication. They need to make a web request in a way that triggers the incomplete fix behavior. ",
