The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14833.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Intuit Lacerte tax software transfers sensitive customer data in cleartext over the network using SMBv2, and stores the data in unencrypted format on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** Sensitive data, including full customer records with SSNs, addresses, etc. are transmitted over the network without encryption using SMBv2.
- **Unencrypted Storage:** Sensitive customer data is stored in unencrypted form on the server's database.
- **Lack of Access Controls:** Access controls can be easily bypassed as the sensitive data is stored in cleartext and accessible by simply extracting strings from the database files.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The client software requests the entire customer database upon launch, after authentication by the CPA to the client application. The server responds by dumping the entire database over the network.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can obtain a large amount of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) for all clients of the affected CPA firm.
- **Identity Theft:** The stolen information can be used to commit identity theft or file fraudulent tax returns.
- **Financial Fraud:**  An attacker can gain access to sensitive financial data, including bank account numbers, and tax information.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept the cleartext communication to gain access to sensitive information in transit.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network as the client and server can capture the SMBv2 traffic to obtain the exposed data.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks:** An attacker can perform MITM attacks, such as ARP poisoning, on the same broadcast domain as the client/server to intercept the data.
- **Compromised Workstation:** An attacker can compromise a workstation on the network to access the data.
- **Direct access to unencrypted database file:** An attacker can gain access to the server where the unencrypted database file is stored, and extract the sensitive information by examining strings within the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be on the same physical network (collision domain) or broadcast domain as the client and server.
- Attacker could also compromise a workstation on the network.
- No specific user credentials to the application are required for the data to be exposed in transit or at rest.
