Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-14680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `libmspack` library not rejecting blank CHM filenames. This is due to a missing check for empty file names within the `chmd.c` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation: The code does not properly validate the CHM file name, failing to reject blank names
- This missing check allows the program to proceed with a zero-length file name, which was not intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: By providing a crafted CHM file with a blank file name, an attacker can cause the application using `libmspack` to crash
- This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by opening or processing a specially crafted CHM file with a blank file name.
- The attack vector is a malicious CHM file delivered to a user or application using the vulnerable library

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CHM file to an application that uses the affected versions of `libmspack`.
- No special permissions are needed

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for the `name_len` variable, ensuring that it's not zero before proceeding with the filename processing.
- The fix is included in `libmspack` version 0.7alpha and later.
- Multiple vendors such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Gentoo have released patches to address the issue
- This vulnerability was part of a set of vulnerabilities fixed in `libmspack`, including CVE-2018-14679, CVE-2018-14681 and CVE-2018-14682.
