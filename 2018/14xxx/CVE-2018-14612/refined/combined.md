Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that btrfs file system

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate

metadata. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious

btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-14610](/security/CVE-2018-14610), [CVE-2018-14611](/security/CVE-2018-14611), [CVE-2018-14612](/security/CVE-2018-14612),

[CVE-2018-14613](/security/CVE-2018-14613), [CVE-2018-14609](/security/CVE-2018-14609))

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

It was discovered that a use-after-free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when certain failure conditions occurred. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20856](/security/CVE-2018-20856))

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilty existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12818](/security/CVE-2019-12818))

It was discovered that the MDIO bus devices subsystem in the Linux kernel

improperly dropped a device reference in an error condition, leading to a

use-after-free. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-12819](/security/CVE-2019-12819))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Empia EM28xx DVB USB device driver

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability

when disconnecting the device. An attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-2024](/security/CVE-2019-2024))

It was discovered that the USB video device class implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control bits, resulting in an out of

bounds buffer read. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-2101](/security/CVE-2019-2101))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

It was discovered that the Appletalk IP encapsulation driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly prevent kernel addresses from being copied to user

space. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this to

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3932-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18249](/security/CVE-2017-18249))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to

construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13097](/security/CVE-2018-13097), [CVE-2018-13099](/security/CVE-2018-13099), [CVE-2018-13100](/security/CVE-2018-13100),

[CVE-2018-14614](/security/CVE-2018-14614), [CVE-2018-14616](/security/CVE-2018-14616))

Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that btrfs file system implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14610](/security/CVE-2018-14610), [CVE-2018-14611](/security/CVE-2018-14611),

[CVE-2018-14612](/security/CVE-2018-14612), [CVE-2018-14613](/security/CVE-2018-14613))

Vasily Averin and Evgenii Shatokhin discovered that a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the NFS41+ subsystem when multiple network

namespaces are in use. A local attacker in a container could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-16884](/security/CVE-2018-16884))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the PPP

over L2TP implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker

could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9517](/security/CVE-2018-9517))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18249](/security/CVE-2017-18249))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to

construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13097](/security/CVE-2018-13097), [CVE-2018-13099](/security/CVE-2018-13099), [CVE-2018-13100](/security/CVE-2018-13100),

[CVE-2018-14614](/security/CVE-2018-14614), [CVE-2018-14616](/security/CVE-2018-14616))

Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that btrfs file system implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14610](/security/CVE-2018-14610), [CVE-2018-14611](/security/CVE-2018-14611),

[CVE-2018-14612](/security/CVE-2018-14612), [CVE-2018-14613](/security/CVE-2018-14613))

Vasily Averin and Evgenii Shatokhin discovered that a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the NFS41+ subsystem when multiple network

namespaces are in use. A local attacker in a container could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-16884](/security/CVE-2018-16884))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the PPP

over L2TP implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker

could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9517](/security/CVE-2018-9517))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Commit Message

```

Reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199847, where
the crafted image has empty root tree block, which will cause later NULL
pointer dereference.

The following trees should never be empty:
1) Tree root
   Must contain at least root items for extent tree, device tree and fs
   tree

2) Chunk tree
   Or we can't even bootstrap.

3) Fs tree
   At least inode item for top level inode (.).

4) Device tree
   Dev extents for chunks

5) Extent tree
   Must has corresponding extent for each chunk.

If any is empty, we are sure the fs is corrupted and no need to mount
it.

                 CVE-2020-12770 CVE-2020-12826 CVE-2020-13143

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

    A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (filesystem corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

    The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully
    validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap
    out-of-bounds write.  A local user permitted to access the device
    node for an input or VT device could possibly use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

    Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
    read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
    read-write.  However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian
    kernel configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

    Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top
    of IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by
    IPsec, IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility.  This could result
    in disclosure of information over the network, since it would not
    be encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

    It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
    properly manage device lifetimes.  Removing a PTP hardware clock
    from the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
    use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

    It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
    serialise access to its internal state.  The security impact of
    this is unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's
    binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

    Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's
    permission checks.  A parent process can choose an arbitary signal
    for a child process to send when it exits, but if the parent has
    executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent.  A
    local user permitted to run a program for several days could
    bypass this check, execute a setuid program, and then send an
    arbitrary signal to it.  Depending on the setuid programs
    installed, this could have some security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.  Binary packages for
the EABI ARM (armel) architecture are not yet available, and a separate
announcement will be made when they are.

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This update is now available for all supported architectures.  For
reference the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

    A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (filesystem corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

    The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully
    validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap
    out-of-bounds write.  A local user permitted to access the device
    node for an input or VT device could possibly use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

    Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
    read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
    read-write.  However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian
    kernel configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

    Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top
    of IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by
    IPsec, IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility.  This could result
    in disclosure of information over the network, since it would not
    be encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

    It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
    properly manage device lifetimes.  Removing a PTP hardware clock
    from the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
    use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

    It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
    serialise access to its internal state.  The security impact of
    this is unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's
    binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

    Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's
    permission checks.  A parent process can choose an arbitary signal
    for a child process to send when it exits, but if the parent has
    executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent.  A
    local user permitted to run a program for several days could
    bypass this check, execute a setuid program, and then send an
    arbitrary signal to it.  Depending on the setuid programs
    installed, this could have some security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Commit Message

```

Reported in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199847, the
image has empty extent tree.

Although that image also has empty root tree, thus can be catched by
tree checker on empty leaves, but if a crafted btrfs has missing block
group items, it could still cause problem.

This patch will do extra check to ensure each chunk has its
corresponding block group.
