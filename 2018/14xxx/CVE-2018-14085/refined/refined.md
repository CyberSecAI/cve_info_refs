```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `UserWallet` contract uses `delegatecall` with `msg.data` to an address provided by `sweeperList.sweeperOf(_token)`. This allows the called contract to modify the storage of the calling contract (`UserWallet`) because `delegatecall` executes code in the context of the caller.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unsafe usage of delegatecall allows arbitrary code execution in the context of the `UserWallet` contract. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the called contract's function `sweep()` can manipulate the `UserWallet`'s storage using the `delegatecall` mechanism. The `sweeperList` is updated due to the logic in the `Exploit` contract.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can modify the storage of the `UserWallet` contract by controlling the logic in the `Exploit` contract. In the provided example, the attacker modifies the variable `start` in the `UserWallet` contract to `0x123456789` by overwriting the `sweeperList` variable in the victim contract, though it's likely an unintended variable to modify as it exists in the `Exploit` contract. The attacker would be able to overwrite critical variables in the contract and potentially take full control of it, leading to theft of funds.
- Attack vectors: The attacker needs to first convince the `UserWallet`'s owner to add a malicious contract address to the `sweepers` mapping in the `Controller` contract using `addSweeper()` method. Then, the attacker calls `sweep()` function in the `UserWallet` contract using the token set up in the previous step to trigger the malicious `delegatecall` which overwrites the `sweeperList` contract address to `0x123456789`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to convince the `UserWallet`'s owner to add the malicious contract to the list of authorized sweepers. Once that's done, the attacker can initiate the attack using the sweep method.
