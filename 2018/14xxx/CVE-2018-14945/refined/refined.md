{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `readFromBMP` function in `jpeg_encoder.cpp` reads data from a BMP file into a buffer. If the file's size is larger than the allocated buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs during the read operation via `fread`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior. Specifically, this can cause a write out of bounds during the `fread` operation when reading pixel data from a BMP file.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted BMP file with a size exceeding the allocated buffer within the `readFromBMP` function. The overflow occurs when reading pixel data via `fread`.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted BMP file to the vulnerable application that will then cause a buffer overflow when the application attempts to read it."
