I used **Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer** to build **jpeg-encoder**, this [file](https://github.com/fouzhe/security/blob/master/jpeg_encoder/SEGV__convertColorSpace) can cause SEGV in function \_convertColorSpace in jpeg\_encoder.cpp when executing this command:

```
./a.out SEGV__convertColorSpace
