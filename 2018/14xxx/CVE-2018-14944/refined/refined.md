The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14944.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs in the `readFromBMP` function of the `jpeg_encoder.cpp` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during a `fread` operation, suggesting a potential issue with reading data from the BMP file.
- A write memory access violation occurs at an unknown address, which is likely due to an out-of-bounds write or an invalid memory access during the BMP parsing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to a segmentation fault (SEGV), resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted BMP file to the `readFromBMP` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious BMP file to be processed by the vulnerable code.
