- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs in the `jitana::axml_parser::parse_start_namespace` function. When parsing a crafted XML file, the code attempts to write to a memory location pointed to by the `rax` register, which has an invalid address (`0xfffffffffffffff8`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Invalid memory access (write) due to an incorrect address being loaded into a register leading to segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The program crashes due to a segmentation fault.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted XML file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious XML file that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker does not need a privileged position.
