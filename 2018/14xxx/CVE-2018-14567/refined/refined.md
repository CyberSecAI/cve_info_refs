  "CVE-2018-14567": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop during LZMA decompression in libxml2 when parsing a crafted XML file, triggered by the LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR return from the lzma_code function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Infinite loop during LZMA decompression",
      "Improper error handling of LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (infinite loop, resource exhaustion)",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted XML file with specific LZMA compressed data.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted XML file to be parsed by libxml2 with LZMA support enabled."
