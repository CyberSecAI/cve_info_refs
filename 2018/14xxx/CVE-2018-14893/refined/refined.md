The content is related to CVE-2018-14893.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The device's API passes user input to `zyshclient`, a proprietary command-line interface. The Zyxel-sh language, used by `zyshclient`, is vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability in the Zyxel-sh language
- Lack of proper input sanitization when passing user input to `zyshclient`
- Vulnerability exists in API endpoints (`/cmd,/.*`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Low privilege users can execute arbitrary system commands as root.
- Attackers can spawn an unauthenticated telnetd server.
- Attackers can completely compromise the device remotely.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to vulnerable API endpoints (`/cmd,/.*`).
- Passing crafted input containing Zyxel-sh injection sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
- The attacker can be a low-privilege user.
- The attacker can be unauthenticated if combined with the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2018-14892) described in the blog post.
