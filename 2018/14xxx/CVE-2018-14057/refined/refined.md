Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-14057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insufficient protection of multiple functions within the Pimcore application against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   The existing anti-CSRF token ("X-pimcore-csrf-token") is only validated in the "Settings > Users / Roles" function, leaving other functions vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection for most functions, allowing attackers to perform actions without a valid anti-CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack to add, update, or delete entries and potentially perform other unauthorized actions within the application on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   This could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized configuration changes, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious website, email, or other methods that trick a logged-in user into making a request to the vulnerable application.
*   An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a user into executing it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the Pimcore application into clicking a malicious link or submitting a form from a different domain/site.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Pimcore application, but the victim must be logged in.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides a list of vulnerable requests that lack CSRF protection.
*   The vendor partially fixed this vulnerability in version 5.3.0
*   The vulnerability was found in Pimcore version 5.2.3 and below.
