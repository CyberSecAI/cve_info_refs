SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20180813-0 >
=======================================================================
              title: SQL Injection, XSS & CSRF vulnerabilities
            product: Pimcore
 vulnerable version: 5.2.3 and below
      fixed version: 5.3.0
         CVE number: CVE-2018-14057, CVE-2018-14058, CVE-2018-14059

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Pimcore is an award-winning consolidated open source enterprise platform for
master data management (PIM/MDM), user experience management (CMS/UX), digital
asset management (DAM) and eCommerce."

Source: <https://pimcore.com/en>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch for most identified issues, but XSS will not be fixed
according to the vendor.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly
advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been identified in the REST web
service API. An attacker who obtains a valid API key that is granted a
necessary permission could successfully perform an attack to extract
information from the database.

2. Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)
Multiple stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified
across multiple functions in the application, which allows an authenticated
attacker to insert arbitrary JavaScript code in virtually all text fields and
data entries in the application.

3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)
Multiple functions in the application are not protected by the existing
anti-CSRF token, which allows an attacker to perform a cross-site request
forgery attack to at least add, update or delete entries, among other actions.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)
The following URLs demonstrate the issue:
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>

Note that a valid API key that is granted at least either "Assets", "Documents"
or "Objects" permission is required to perform an SQL injection attack against
associated API endpoints successfully.

2. Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)
Most of the text fields in pop-up dialogs and data entries in the application
are vulnerable to the cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can be
exploited by an authenticated attacker. For example, the attacker could insert
an attack payload while performing at least the following actions:

1) Edit a user account's first name/last name/e-mail address.
2) Edit a Document Types/Predefined Properties/Predefined Asset Metadata/
Quantity Value/Static Routes entry value in the table.
3) Rename an Assets/Data Objects/Video Thumbnails/Image Thumbnails/
Field-Collections/Objectbrick/Classification Store item.

The vendor stated that many identified XSS issues only affect administrative
functions and hence the issues will not be fixed:
"They are only affecting administrative functionalities (higher privileges
required) - so this isn't used by non-trusted users - a check just adds
additional overhead without any benefits for security."

SEC Consult argued multiple times that XSS can still be exploited e.g. when a
higher privileged user gets attacked and the issues should be fixed nevertheless.

3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)
The existing anti-CSRF token in the HTTP request header named
"X-pimcore-csrf-token" was found to be validated only in the "Settings >
Users / Roles" function. Therefore, an attacker could perform a cross-site
request forgery attack against virtually all other functions in order to
at least add, update and delete data without having to submit the anti-CSRF
token.

The non-exhaustive list of affected requests are listed below:
POST /admin/asset/add-asset
POST /admin/asset/add-asset-compatibility
GET /admin/asset/delete
GET /admin/asset/import-server
GET /admin/asset/import-server-files
GET /admin/asset/import-url
POST /admin/asset/import-zip
POST /admin/asset/update
GET /admin/document/add
GET /admin/document/delete
POST /admin/document/doc-types
POST /admin/email/blacklist
POST /admin/email/email-logs
POST /admin/email/save
POST /admin/hardlink/save
POST /admin/link/save
POST /admin/newsletter/save
GET /admin/object/add
POST /admin/object/save
GET /admin/object/delete
POST /admin/page/save
POST /admin/settings/metadata
POST /admin/settings/properties
POST /admin/settings/set-system
POST /admin/settings/website-settings
POST /admin/snippet/save

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been identified in Pimcore version 5.2.3 which was the
most current version at the time of discovery.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2018-06-15: Contacting vendor through
<https://pimcorehq.wufoo.com/forms/pimcore-security-report>
2018-06-18: Vendor provides the fixes of SQL injection and CSRF in the nightly
            build, but has a problem of reproducing the XSS.
2018-06-18: Contacting vendor to request for a secure channel to provide
            further details of the XSS.
2018-06-18: Sending the details of the XSS.
2018-06-19: Vendor fixes the SQL injection and only fixes the XSS partially.
2018-06-20: Notifying vendor, that SQL injection and XSS are not properly fixed
2018-06-20: Vendor inquires more details about the XSS.
2018-06-21: Explaining vendor the XSS issues and notifying vendor that the CSRF
            has been fixed.
2018-06-21: Vendor will discuss the open issues internally.
2018-07-11: Following up vendor regarding the fixes of the open issues.
2018-07-11: Vendor completely fixes the SQL injection, but decides not to fix
            the XSS in the administrative functions, patch release is planned
            within the next two weeks
2018-07-20: Vendor provides a patched version
2018-08-13: Public release of security advisory

Solution:
---------
The vendor has published a new release (version 5.3.0) which fixes most of the
identified issues, but not the XSS issues that affect administrative functions:

<https://pimcore.com/en/download>

Workaround:

developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Pimcore is affected by several security vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by an attacker to read data records from the database, attack other users of the web application with JavaScript code, browser exploits or Trojan horses, and perform arbitrary actions in the context of the logged-in user (CSRF).

## Vendor Description

*âPimcore is an award-winning consolidated open source enterprise platform for master data management (PIM/MDM), user experience management (CMS/UX), digital asset management (DAM) and eCommerce.â*

Source:Â <https://pimcore.com/en>

## Business Recommendation

The vendor provides a patch for most identified issues, but XSS will not be fixed according to the vendor. An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

### 1) SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been identified in the REST web service API. An attacker who obtains a valid API key that is granted a necessary permission could successfully perform an attack to extract information from the database.

### 2) Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)

Multiple stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified across multiple functions in the application, which allows an authenticated attacker to insert arbitrary JavaScript code in virtually all text fields and data entries in the application.

### 3) Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)

Multiple functions in the application are not protected by the existing anti-CSRF token, which allows an attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery attack to at least add, update or delete entries, among other actions.

## Proof Of Concept

### 1) SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)

The following URLs demonstrate the issue:

***[<host>/webservice/rest/asset-count](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/asset-count?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/asset-inquire](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/asset-inquire?apikey=[...]&amp;id=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/asset-list](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/asset-list?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/document-count](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/document-count?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/document-inquire](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/document-inquire?apikey=[...]&amp;id=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/document-list](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/document-list?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/object-count](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/object-count?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/object-inquire](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/object-inquire?apikey=[...]&amp;id=&lt;SQL) Injection> [<host>/webservice/rest/object-list](http://&lt;host&gt;/webservice/rest/object-list?apikey=[...]&amp;condition=&lt;SQL) Injection>***

Note that a valid API key that is granted at least either âAssetsâ, âDocumentsâ or âObjectsâ permission is required to perform an SQL injection attack against associated API endpoints successfully.

### 2) Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)

Most of the text fields in pop-up dialogs and data entries in the application are vulnerable to the cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can be exploited by an authenticated attacker. For example, the attacker could insert an attack payload while performing at least the following actions:

1. Edit a user accountâs first name/last name/e-mail address.
2. Edit a Document Types/Predefined Properties/Predefined Asset Metadata/ Quantity Value/Static Routes entry value in the table.
3. Rename an Assets/Data Objects/Video Thumbnails/Image Thumbnails/ Field-Collections/Objectbrick/Classification Store item.

The vendor stated that many identified XSS issues only affect administrative functions and hence the issues will not be fixed: âThey are only affecting administrative functionalities (higher privileges required) â so this isnât used by non-trusted users â a check just adds additional overhead without any benefits for security.â

SEC Consult argued multiple times that XSS can still be exploited e.g. when a higher privileged user gets attacked and the issues should be fixed nevertheless.

### 3) Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)

The existing anti-CSRF token in the HTTP request header named âX-pimcore-csrf-tokenâ was found to be validated only in the âSettings > Users / Rolesâ function. Therefore, an attacker could perform a cross-site request forgery attack against virtually all other functions in order to at least add, update and delete data without having to submit the anti-CSRF token.

The non-exhaustive list of affected requests are listed below:

***POST /admin/asset/add-asset
 POST /admin/asset/add-asset-compatibility
 GET /admin/asset/delete
 GET /admin/asset/import-server
 GET /admin/asset/import-server-files
 GET /admin/asset/import-url
 POST /admin/asset/import-zip
 POST /admin/asset/update
 GET /admin/document/add
 GET /admin/document/delete
 POST /admin/document/doc-types
 POST /admin/email/blacklist
 POST /admin/email/email-logs
 POST /admin/email/save
 POST /admin/hardlink/save
 POST /admin/link/save
 POST /admin/newsletter/save
 GET /admin/object/add
 POST /admin/object/save
 GET /admin/object/delete
 POST /admin/page/save
 POST /admin/settings/metadata
 POST /admin/settings/properties
 POST /admin/settings/set-system
 POST /admin/settings/website-settings
 POST /admin/snippet/save***

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

The vulnerabilities have been identified in Pimcore version 5.2.3 which was the most current version at the time of discovery.
