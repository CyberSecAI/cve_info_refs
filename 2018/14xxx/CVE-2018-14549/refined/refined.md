The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14549.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered during a write operation in the `wav_write` function within `libwav.c`. The issue is a null pointer dereference in the `__sanitizer::StackDepotPut` function, which is called as a consequence of an error during memory allocation. Specifically, it seems to be related to the `fopen` call within `wav_write` in `libwav.c`, which is likely due to the program attempting to open the file at a null address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference. The crash happens when trying to allocate memory for the file, indicating a problem with the file path or a related parameter being passed. This causes a read from address `0x0`, which results in a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted WAV file or an invalid file path being passed as an argument to the `wav_gain` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specific input file to the `wav_gain` utility.
