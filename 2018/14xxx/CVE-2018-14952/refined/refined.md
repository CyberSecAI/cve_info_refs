  "vulnerability": "CVE-2018-14952",
  "description": "The provided content reveals a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SquirrelMail. The vulnerability is triggered when displaying a message containing a specific HTML tag: `<math><maction xlink:href=\"`. This tag allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will execute when a user views the email, leading to a persistent XSS condition.",
  "affected_component": "SquirrelMail",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input, specifically within the message display functionality. When SquirrelMail processes and renders HTML, it fails to neutralize the `<math><maction xlink:href=\"` tag, allowing it to be interpreted as executable code rather than plain text.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
    "Insufficient output sanitization/encoding"
   ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites. This is a persistent XSS, where the malicious code is stored in the email message and executes each time the user views the affected message.",
  "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject the malicious code by sending an email with crafted HTML containing the `<math><maction xlink:href=\"` tag. The email is stored on the server, and every time a user opens that email, the injected script is executed in the user's browser.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send email to a user of the vulnerable SquirrelMail instance. No other specific capabilities or positions are required.",
  "additional_information": "The vulnerability was addressed in squirrelmail version 1.4.23."
