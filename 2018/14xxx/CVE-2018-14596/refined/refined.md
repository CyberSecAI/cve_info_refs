- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation or resource management in the verification code generation functionality. The size of the verification code image, particularly the font size, width, and height parameters are directly controlled by user input and cause excessive server-side processing when large values are provided.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The system allows modification of verification code parameters such as `code_len`, `font_size`, `width`, and `height` through the URL query string. Lack of input sanitization allows attackers to provide large values, leading to resource exhaustion. This results in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By manipulating the parameters that control the size and complexity of the verification code, an attacker can cause the server to expend excessive resources trying to generate large images and slow down or completely crash the system. This results in denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests by manipulating the URL parameters of the verification code generation endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to understand the URL parameters of the verification code generator.
