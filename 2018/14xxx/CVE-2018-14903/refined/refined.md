The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14903.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The EPSON WF-2750 printer firmware does not properly validate files before running updates. The printer's firmware updater (EPFWUPD.exe) sends the update file via HTTP protocol to a specific path on the device, which starts processing as soon as the file is received.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient data validation on the printer.
- Insecure communication during firmware update process.
- Lack of proper validation of the update file before processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can cause a printer malfunction.
- Remote attackers can send malicious data to the printer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access to the printer.
- Sending malicious data to the printer's firmware update endpoint via HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable printer.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the printer.
