Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-14793:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to an open communication port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-Based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121): The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling input received through an open communication port, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack using an open communication port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is needed.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow present in Emerson DeltaV DCS Workstations. It can be exploited by sending malicious data through an open communication port, leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected device. The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
