**2. `vuln/RIFF-Chunk-Read_heap-buffer-overflow`**
   - **Root cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `RIFF::Chunk::Read` function when attempting to read more data than allocated.
   - **Weakness:** Heap buffer overflow vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Overwrites heap memory leading to potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** By providing a crafted GIG file with a specific RIFF chunk, leading to an oversized read within the `RIFF::Chunk::Read` function.

**5. `vuln/gig-Region-UpdateChunks:3303_out-of-bounds-read.gig`**
   - **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `gig::Region::UpdateChunks` function while accessing `pDimensionRegions[0]->pSample`.
   - **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to accessing invalid memory.
   - **Attack vector:** By processing a crafted GIG file using the `gig2stereo` tool.

**6. `vuln/DLS-Info-SaveString_out-of-bounds-write.gig`**
   - **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write occurs in `DLS::Info::SaveString` when using `strncpy`.
   - **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to writing to an invalid memory location.
   - **Attack vector:** By processing a crafted GIG file using `gig2stereo`.
   - **Attacker capability:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted GIG file which is then opened by the gig2stereo tool.

**7. `vuln/store16_heap-buffer-overflow.gig`**
   - **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `store16` helper function called from `DLS::File::UpdateChunks`
   - **Weakness:** Heap buffer overflow vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Overwrites heap memory leading to potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Processing a crafted GIG file with the `gig2stereo` tool.
   - **Attacker capability:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted GIG file which is then opened by the gig2stereo tool.

**8. `vuln/gig-File-UpdateChunks_out-of-bounds-read.gig`**
   - **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in `gig::File::UpdateChunks` when accessing `pSamples->size()`.
   - **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
   - **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to accessing invalid memory.
   - **Attack vector:**  By processing a specially crafted GIG file using the `gig2stereo` tool.
   - **Attacker capability:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted GIG file which is then opened by the gig2stereo tool.

**9. `vuln/store32_heap-buffer-overflow.gig`**
  - **Root cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `store32` helper function, called from `DLS::Resource::UpdateChunks`.
