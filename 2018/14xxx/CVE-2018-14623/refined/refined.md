Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Katello application. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input to the `sort_by` parameter in requests made to the `/katello/api/v2/errata` REST API endpoint. This input is not properly sanitized and is directly used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The exploitation leads to the leakage of internal IDs from the `katello_errata` table. This could potentially provide an attacker with more insight into the systemâ€™s structure and data, which could then facilitate further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests to a vulnerable REST API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Katello system.
- Crafting malicious requests: The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests containing malicious SQL injection payload in the `sort_by` parameter.
