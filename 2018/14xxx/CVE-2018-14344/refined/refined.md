{
  "CVE-2018-14344": {
    "description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the ISMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ismp.c by validating the IPX address length to avoid a buffer over-read.",
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
    "impact": "It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious packet that, when processed by Wireshark, triggers a buffer over-read.",
    "root_cause": "The ISMP dissector did not properly validate the IPX address length, leading to a potential buffer over-read when parsing malformed packets."
