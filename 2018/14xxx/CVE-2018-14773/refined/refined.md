{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Symfony HttpFoundation component incorrectly handles the `X-Original-URL` and `X-Rewrite-URL` HTTP headers, which are specific to IIS servers. These headers allow users to override the path in the request URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Support for legacy IIS headers (`X-Original-URL` and `X-Rewrite-URL`) that allow overriding the request URL path."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass restrictions on higher level caches and web servers by accessing one URL but having Symfony return a different one.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with either `X-Original-URL` or `X-Rewrite-URL` headers.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and specify the mentioned headers."
