- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection via the ONVIF interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unspecified CGI scripts that can be abused for command injection. Specifically the ONVIF interface (/onvif/device_service) is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated users can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the ONVIF interface (/onvif/device_service).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user.
