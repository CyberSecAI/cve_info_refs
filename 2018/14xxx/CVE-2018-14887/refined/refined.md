Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-14887:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of placeholders within the `dbfilter` configuration parameter in Odoo. Specifically, the `%d` (domain) and `%h` (host) placeholders were not sanitized before being injected into the final `db_filter` expression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input (the domain and host headers) before they're used in a security-sensitive context (the `db_filter` regular expression). This allows an attacker to inject malicious patterns into the filter expression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Name Disclosure:** An attacker could craft a request that causes the `db_filter` to reveal the names of available databases hosted on the same server, even if database listing was disabled by the administrator.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can craft a malicious regular expression that is inefficient to evaluate, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing a specially crafted host header with malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Publicly Accessible Odoo Instance:** The Odoo instance must be accessible over the network.
*   **Wildcard Virtual Host Configuration:** The web server in front of the Odoo service must be configured to allow arbitrary domain names, for example with a wildcard expression for subdomains or the Odoo service is directly exposed to the internet. This allows the attacker to send a request with a malicious `Host` header that matches the wildcard.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise editions 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0
*   The specific configuration necessary to make this exploitable (db\_filter with %d or %h placeholder and a wildcard virtual host) is considered rare.
*   Odoo Cloud servers were not vulnerable as they don't use db\_filter.
*   The issue was corrected in the following commits:
