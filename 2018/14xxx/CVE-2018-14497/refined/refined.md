{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Tenda D152 ADSL router does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when setting the SSID, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The injected JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser when accessing the router's web interface, potentially allowing attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on the router on behalf of the administrator.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can inject the malicious script by changing the SSID parameter in the router's configuration page.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface. This could be an authenticated user, or potentially an attacker on the same network if the web interface is not properly secured."
