{
  "CVE-2018-14469": {
    "description": "The IKEv1 parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-isakmp.c:ikev1_n_print().",
    "root_cause": "A buffer over-read in the `ikev1_n_print()` function when parsing IKEv1 packets.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets that when printed would trigger the flaw and crash the application, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS). Memory data disclosure is also possible.",
        "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted IKEv1 packets to a system using a vulnerable tcpdump version"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to send specially crafted IKEv1 packets to trigger the vulnerability. This can be achieved by a remote attacker.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability resides in the `ikev1_n_print()` function in `print-isakmp.c`. The issue occurs when parsing a REPLAY-STATUS notify message used in IKEv1, specifically when there are not enough bytes in the buffer to read the 32-bit value indicating whether replay detection is enabled. This could print memory data on the victim's screen or crash tcpdump.",
    "suggested_fix": "Upgrade to tcpdump version 4.9.3 or later."
