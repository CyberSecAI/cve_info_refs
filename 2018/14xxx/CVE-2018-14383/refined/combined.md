### More details

Doing the same things is very mechanic. Creating the same Jira issues also. If you feel that you are wasting time doing it manually - The Scheduler plugin is perfect solution for you!

The Scheduler allows you to plan and automate your process – all you need to do is to create issue template, define when it should be created – and that’s all!

Your issues can be created daily, weekly, monthly, or you can create your own interval. You can create pending issues and even manually execute them with a single click!

Since version 5.0 you can [attach sub-tasks](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/2587337/Add%2BSub-Task%2Bto%2BScheduled%2BIssue%2B5.x) to your scheduled issues and take your automation to the next level.

With our [Permissions](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/1322024987/Permissions) you can define who can create scheduled issues: single users, groups or project role.

Clone scheduled issues and populate them to other projects. If you want to share your recurring tasks or do a backup, use our import/export feature to easily bring back all the settings or import data to another instance.

Use [The Scheduler](https://psc-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCHED/pages/2452271/The%2BScheduler%2B5.x%2Bdocumentation) and start saving your time!

#
# Product: The Scheduler (Jira plugin)
# Vendor: Transition Technologies PSC
# CSNC ID: CSNC-2018-022
# CVE ID: CVE-2018-14383
# Subject: XML External Entity (XXE) Attack
# Risk: High
# Effect: Remotely exploitable
# Author: Thierry Viaccoz
# Date: 06.08.2019
#
################################################################################
Introduction:
-------------
The Scheduler [1] is a plugin for the Atlassian tool Jira [2]. It allows to
automate the process of creating recurring tasks in Jira. Using the plugin, it
is possible to define the issue template once and simply to select how often
it should be created. After this, The Scheduler will simply create the issues
in Jira.
For the administrators' convenience, the plugin offers the possibility to
export and import scheduled issues in XML format from the administration
interface.
Compass Security discovered that the import XML parser allows defining inline
DTDs in the XML messages and interprets external entities. This makes it
vulnerable to XXE (XML External Entity) attacks, i.e. allowing an
administrator to read arbitrary files on the server.
Affected:
---------
Vulnerable:
\* 5.1.3
Not vulnerable:
\* 5.2.1
\* 3.3.7
No other version was tested, but it is believed for the older versions to be
also vulnerable.
Technical Description:
----------------------
First of all, make sure to have at least one scheduled issue configured in the
The Scheduler and export the configuration of The Scheduler as XML file by
going to Administration > Add-ons > Export Scheduled Issues.
Then, modify the exported XML file to include the XXE "]>" at the beginning. In addition, only keep
one of the nodes "ScheduledIssueElement". In this node, set "&c" as
"paramValue" for the "ParamElement" with "paramName" set to "description".
Below is an example of such an XML file:
========
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?

========
Afterwards, import the XML file by using the function Administration > Add-ons
> Import Scheduled Issues.
Finally, go to Administration > Add-ons > Manage Scheduled Issues and open the
issue that was just created by the import function. It shows the content of
the file "/etc/passwd" in the "Issue Description" because of the XXE in the
imported XML file, as shown in the response below.

  [CUT]
  =========
  Workaround / Fix:
  -----------------
  The vulnerability is a result of a weakly configured/parameterized XML parser.
  The parser needs to be hardened by changing settings in the configuration or
  parameters in the code. It must not allow the use of inline DTDs and external
  entities.
