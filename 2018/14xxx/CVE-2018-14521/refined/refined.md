The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The crash occurs due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) within the `swr_is_initialized` function of the libswresample-ffmpeg library, which is part of FFmpeg. The issue arises during the audio resampling process when using `aubiomfcc`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A null pointer dereference or access to an invalid memory location is occurring within `swr_is_initialized`.
- The vulnerability occurs due to a malformed input file provided to `aubiomfcc`, which then causes the underlying `libswresample-ffmpeg` library to crash.
- The specific malformation is not detailed, but it leads to the `swr_is_initialized` function to attempt to dereference an address 0x000000003a50, causing the crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) condition. When `aubiomfcc` is used with a crafted malicious input, the program crashes, preventing further processing and execution.
- The crash results in the program terminating abnormally.
- The vulnerability could potentially be used to disrupt systems that use `aubiomfcc` for audio processing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is providing a specially crafted audio file as an input to the `aubiomfcc` command-line tool.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the audio processing stages, specifically the resampling part of the audio decoding process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious audio file to the `aubiomfcc` application.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges other than the ability to execute the `aubiomfcc` binary.
- The attacker can be a local user or someone who can supply a crafted input file to the program.
