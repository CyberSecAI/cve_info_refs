        "root_cause": "The device driver reads a value from a memory location controlled by the peripheral device, and uses this value as an index into an array. If the peripheral device provides a large index value, the driver will read out of the array's bounds, leading to memory corruption. Additionally, if overlapping fetches occur while the device can still modify the data, double-fetch bugs may be present.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper validation of input from peripheral device",
          "Out-of-bounds read",

        "root_cause": "The `dhd_bus_flow_ring_flush_response` function in the Broadcom Wi-Fi driver uses a `flowid` obtained from the Wi-Fi chip without validation as an index into the `flow_ring_table`, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This index is attacker-controlled.",
