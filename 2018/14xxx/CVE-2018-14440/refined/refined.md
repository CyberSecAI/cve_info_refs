The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `CompanyWebsite` project. The vulnerability is reported within a GitHub issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `noticeInfo` parameter within a POST request to `/CompanyWebsite/admin/noticeManageAction_queryNotice.action`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct incorporation of user-controlled input into a SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized database operations, such as:
    - Accessing sensitive data.
    - Modifying or deleting data.
    - Possibly gaining control of the database server in severe cases.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request. The vulnerable parameter is `noticeInfo`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the `noticeInfo` POST parameter.
- No specific authentication appears to be needed in the provided report, but that might depend on the application's configuration.
