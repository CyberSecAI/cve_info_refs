Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of DNS queries in the PowerDNS Authoritative Server and Recursor. Specifically, a crafted DNS query can cause an answer *without* DNSSEC records to be inserted into the packet cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Packet Cache Pollution:** The core issue is that the packet cache can be polluted with responses lacking DNSSEC records when they should be present.
- **Lack of Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the presence of DNSSEC records when caching responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  When a DNSSEC-signed domain is queried, a polluted cache will return the incorrect answer (without DNSSEC records). DNSSEC validating clients will then consider this response bogus, causing resolution to fail until the polluted cache entry expires. This leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted DNS Queries:**  The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted DNS query to the PowerDNS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending the crafted DNS query.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable PowerDNS server.

**Affected Versions:**

*   **PowerDNS Authoritative Server:** 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.4
*   **PowerDNS Recursor:** 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4

**Unaffected Versions:**

*   **PowerDNS Authoritative Server:** 4.1.5, 4.0.x
*   **PowerDNS Recursor:** 4.1.5, 4.0.9

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both the Authoritative Server and the Recursor components of PowerDNS.
- The issue was discovered and reported by Kees Monshouwer.
