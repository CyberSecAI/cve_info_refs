VIVOTEK Product Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VVTK-SA-2018-004
CVE ID: CVE-2018-14769
First Published: August 24, 2018
Last Update: August 24, 2018
Status: Fixed
Revision: 1

Overview:
Security researcher Ayushman Dutta discovered that VIVOTEK Network Camera have

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. It allows remote attackers to hijack the cgi

command. For more CSRF information please check following URL:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery.

Affect Products:
All Network Camera Series using firmware prior to XXXXXX-VVTK-0X06a.

Workarounds:
1.  Using VMS (video management system) to manage your IP Camera device, as VMS is NOT

affected or attacked by CSRF.

2.  Avoid using operation systemâ€™s default browser to manage your IP Camera. Since CSRF can

only attack browsers that you have logged into for IP Cameras and trigger attacks by precision

prepared malicious webpage, using a non-default browser can effectively reduce the risk of being

attacked.

Solution:
Please upgrade firmware to XXXXXX-VVTK-0X06a or above.

Alert:

Due to CSRF protection solution, after upgraded you camera firmware, please also upgrade

your Shepherd to version 3.0 or above to make all operations function normally.
