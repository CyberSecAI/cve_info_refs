INFORMATION

Product: Loytec LGATE-902 (<https://www.loytec.com/>)
Affected versions: < 6.4.2 (tested on version 6.3.2)
CVE IDs: CVE-2018-14919 (Stored and reflected XSS), CVE-2018-14918 (Path
traversal), and CVE-2018-14916 (Arbitrary file deletion).
Remote-exploit: yes

TIMELINE

Vendor notification: 26th July, 2018
Vendor acknowledgment: 1st August, 2018
Patch available: 13th November, 2018
Public disclosure: 7th April, 2019

INTRODUCTION

The LGATE-902 Gateway is a powerful gateway that can host user specific
graphical pages. The gateways provide connectivity functions to concurrently
integrate CEA-709 (LonMark Systems), BACnet, KNX, Modbus, and M-Bus. Local
operation and override is provided by the built-in jog dial and the backlit
display (128x64 pixels). Device and data point information is provided by the
Web interface and shown on the display via symbols and in text format.
(Description from: <https://www.loytec.com/products/gateways/2259-lgate-902>)

The three vulnerabilities described below affect the web application that runs
in the gateways and that is used to manage them.

VULNERABILITIES DESCRIPTION

The XSS vulnerability (CVE-2018-14919) allows an attacker to inject malicious
scripts into the trusted web interface running on a vulnerable device. The
scripts may be executed by the browser of an unsuspecting device administrator
to access session tokens or other sensitive information, as well as to perform
malicious actions on behalf of the user (e.g., internal network discovery and
traffic tunneling using BeEF).

Reflected XSS PoC (show alert dialog):
http://<device_address>/webui/data/alarm_log_obj?handle=1000%27-alert(1)-%27&page=0

Stored XSS PoC (show alert dialog):
POST http://<device_address>/webui/config/doc/action
save=1&update=1&data=[["test","</script><script>alert(1);</script>",2]]

The path traversal (CVE-2018-14918) and file deletion (CVE-2018-14916)
vulnerabilities allow an attacker to manipulate path references and access or
delete files and directories (including critical system files) that are stored
outside the root folder of the web application running on the device. This can
be used to read or delete system and configuration files containing, e.g.,
usernames and passwords.

Path traversal PoC (read /etc/passwd):
http://<device_address>/webui/file_guest?path=/var/www/documentation/../../../../../etc/passwd&flags=1152

File deletion PoC (delete ../test.txt):
POST http://<device_address>/webui/config/doc/action
delete=1&update=1&name=../test.txt

SOLUTION

Update to version 6.4.2
