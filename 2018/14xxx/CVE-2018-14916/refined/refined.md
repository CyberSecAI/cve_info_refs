Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-14916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the web application of the Loytec LGATE-902 gateway, allowing an attacker to manipulate path references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete arbitrary files on the device's filesystem due to improper handling of file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete files and directories outside the web application's root folder, which includes critical system files.
- Deletion of configuration files containing usernames and passwords, system files, or other critical data can severely impact the device's functionality, and could lead to denial of service, or allow for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface of the device.
- An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/webui/config/doc/action` endpoint with specific parameters (`delete=1&update=1&name=../test.txt`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- No specific authentication is mentioned for this vulnerability, but it's likely that the web interface is accessible to those with access to the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of the Loytec LGATE-902 gateway prior to 6.4.2, and was tested on version 6.3.2
*   The vendor was notified on July 26th, 2018, and a patch was made available on November 13th, 2018.
