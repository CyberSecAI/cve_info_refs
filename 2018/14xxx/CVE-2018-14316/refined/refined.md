Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2018-14316:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The content from `zerodayinitiative.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2018-14316`. The provided description states "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader... The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer". This aligns with the general nature of a CVE detailing a vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing PDF documents within Foxit Reader. This leads to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient data validation.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Information disclosure: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by reading beyond the intended buffer limits.
   - Potential for code execution within the context of the application, based on further exploitation from an out of bounds read.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - Remote attack via a malicious PDF file.
   - User interaction is required, as the target must open a malicious PDF file. This could occur via the user visiting a malicious page that prompts the file download or by direct opening a file.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file which exploits the parsing vulnerability of the application.
   - Attacker needs to deliver the malicious PDF file to the victim.
