Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14347:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An infinite loop exists in the `mpeg_extractor.c` file within the libextractor library. This occurs during the parsing of a malformed file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is specifically an infinite loop, meaning the affected program will repeatedly process data without ever completing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The `extract` tool, when processing a malicious file, will enter an infinite loop. This would lead to the tool becoming unresponsive and consuming excessive CPU resources, thus preventing normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted or malformed file. When the libextractor library attempts to extract metadata from this file, it triggers the infinite loop vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed file to be processed by the vulnerable `extract` tool or any application using the vulnerable version of the `libextractor` library. The attacker doesn't need to be local to the vulnerable machine; the file could be delivered through various means (e.g., as a downloaded file, an email attachment, etc.).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Libfuzzer and reported by the ADLab of Venustech.
- The issue affects at least version 1.6 of the extract tool.
- The vulnerability is fixed in `libextractor` version `1:1.3-2+deb8u2` for Debian 8 "Jessie" and version `1:1.3-4+deb9u2` for Debian stretch.
