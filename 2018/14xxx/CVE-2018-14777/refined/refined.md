Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the "addnews" feature of DataLife Engine versions 13.0 and before. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the fields of the "addnews" form before storing and rendering it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79 and CWE-80), allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** When an administrator or user views the attacker's crafted post, the malicious script embedded within it executes in their browser.
*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** The executed script can access sensitive information such as cookies and session tokens.
*   **Content Manipulation:** The script can rewrite the HTML content of the page, potentially leading to further attacks or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **POST Method:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-supplied input submitted using the POST method.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are the fields within the "addnews" form.
*   **Vulnerable Files:** The vulnerable files are `/index.php?do=addnews` and `/addnews.html`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the DataLife Engine application to be able to access the "addnews" form.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific vulnerable parameters and how to inject malicious scripts.
