[+] Title: DataLife Engine Core Cross Site Scripting (XSS) & Execution Code
[+] Date: 2018/08/02
[+] Author: Mostafa Gharzi
[+] Team: Maher - CertCC.ir
[+] Vendor Homepage: www.dleviet.com
www.dle-news.com
[+] Tested on: Windows 10 & Kali Linux
[+] Versions: 13.0 and Before
[+] Vulnerable Parameter: Post Method
[+] Vulnerable File: /index.php?do=addnews & /addnews.html
[+} Dork : inurl:/index.php?subaction=userinfo
### Notes:
An attacker can use XSS (in addnews fields section from datalife engine 13.0 and Before)
to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting Admins or users. The end admins or useras browser
has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute
the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the
malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive
information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts
can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
### POC:
[+] First, sign up through this path: http://localhost/index.php?do=register
[+] Once logged in, Go to this page: http://localhost/index.php?do=addnews
or
http://localhost/addnews.html
[+] For example, put this code in the fields: <img src="Image link">
"><svg onload=alert('CertCC')>
"><br>text
[+] When the admin goes to validate your post, he will see your alert or executable code.
[+] Therefore, the administrator and subsequent users are attacked by XSS.
