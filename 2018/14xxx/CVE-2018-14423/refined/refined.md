Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14423:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error that occurs within the `pi_next_pcrl`, `pi_next_cprl`, and `pi_next_rpcl` functions in `lib/openjp3d/pi.c`. The issue stems from a lack of checks to prevent a zero divisor when performing modulo operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Division by zero: The core weakness is the possibility of a division by zero, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in an application crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted J2K File: Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted J2K file, which is a specific type of JPEG 2000 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote and needs the ability to provide a malicious J2K file to a system using the vulnerable version of openjpeg2 library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the 3D version of openjpeg2 (openjp3d) which suggests this may not be present in standard 2D JPEG2000 usage.
- The provided github issue link shows that this is similar to other division-by-zero vulnerabilities in the same code-base.
- The fix involves adding checks to avoid division by zero before attempting the modulo operations.
