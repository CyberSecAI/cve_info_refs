{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zyxel device does not implement proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing request origin verification, which allows CSRF attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a user into making state-changing requests on the device, such as disabling telnet or creating new users.",
  "Attack vectors": "CSRF attacks through a malicious webpage.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious web page. The user must have an active session on the Zyxel device."
