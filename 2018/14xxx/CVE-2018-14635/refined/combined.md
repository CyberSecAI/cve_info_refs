| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 11:02:35 UTC  ```  It was found that a non privileged tenant can add a router interface to a shared / external network's subnet with an IP address outside the subnet's allocation pool. This can result in a Denial of Service.  Upstream issue:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1757482](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1757482)  Upstream patch:  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron/commit/?id=54aa6e81cb17b33ce4d5d469cc11dec2869c762d>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 11:03:04 UTC  ``` Created openstack-neutron tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1607824](show_bug.cgi?id=1607824 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-14635 openstack-neutron: A router interface out of subnet IP range results in a denial of service [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c2)  Assaf Muller    2018-07-24 14:27:29 UTC  ``` Hi Andrej,  The fix has been merged to the upstream master branch and backports were proposed in Ocata to Queens (equiv. to OSP 11 to 13). We'll need to do a downstream only backport to OSP 10. Were you going to open RHBZs on openstack-neutron branches 10 to 13?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 14:30:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Assaf Muller from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c2)) > Hi Andrej, >  > The fix has been merged to the upstream master branch and backports were > proposed in Ocata to Queens (equiv. to OSP 11 to 13). We'll need to do a > downstream only backport to OSP 10. Were you going to open RHBZs on > openstack-neutron branches 10 to 13?  Hi Assaf,  I have been asked to open the flaw by Joshua Padman. I believe that our Openstack analysis team will get to this shortly and open the relevant trackers. I'll leave it up to their analysis to figure out which of our OSPs need the backports.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c4)  James Hebden    2018-07-24 23:02:43 UTC  ``` RHOSP 7.0 through 14.0 all exhibit this behaviour, so I am creating RHBZs for those versions, with the goal of downstream backports being performed for those releases too. In RHOSP 9.0 through 13.0, the function _validate_router_port_info is addressed by the linked upstream patch in OpenStack gerrit, potentially with small adjustments so everything applies cleanly. In addition, the neutron In RHOSP 7.0 and 8.0, the function _validate_router_port_info (which the upstream patches apply to) in db/l3_db.py had not been introduced, so does not exist in 7.0 and 8.0's l3_db.py - the simple validation logic is however consolidated in the _add_interface_by_port function in these older releases. Given no similar protection logic is present in these releases, I suggest that in order to address this for those releases, additional backporting work would be required to add validation to _add_interface_by_port.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c6)  Joshua Padman    2018-07-25 04:07:47 UTC  ``` Clearing my needinfo as James has suitably answered the query.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-17 16:46:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2018:2710 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2710](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2710)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-17 16:52:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2018:2715 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2715](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2715)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-12-05 18:52:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike)  Via RHSA-2018:3792 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3792](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3792)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 11:02:35 UTC  ```  It was found that a non privileged tenant can add a router interface to a shared / external network's subnet with an IP address outside the subnet's allocation pool. This can result in a Denial of Service.  Upstream issue:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1757482](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1757482)  Upstream patch:  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron/commit/?id=54aa6e81cb17b33ce4d5d469cc11dec2869c762d>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 11:03:04 UTC  ``` Created openstack-neutron tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1607824](show_bug.cgi?id=1607824 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-14635 openstack-neutron: A router interface out of subnet IP range results in a denial of service [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c2)  Assaf Muller    2018-07-24 14:27:29 UTC  ``` Hi Andrej,  The fix has been merged to the upstream master branch and backports were proposed in Ocata to Queens (equiv. to OSP 11 to 13). We'll need to do a downstream only backport to OSP 10. Were you going to open RHBZs on openstack-neutron branches 10 to 13?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c3)  Andrej Nemec    2018-07-24 14:30:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Assaf Muller from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c2)) > Hi Andrej, >  > The fix has been merged to the upstream master branch and backports were > proposed in Ocata to Queens (equiv. to OSP 11 to 13). We'll need to do a > downstream only backport to OSP 10. Were you going to open RHBZs on > openstack-neutron branches 10 to 13?  Hi Assaf,  I have been asked to open the flaw by Joshua Padman. I believe that our Openstack analysis team will get to this shortly and open the relevant trackers. I'll leave it up to their analysis to figure out which of our OSPs need the backports.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c4)  James Hebden    2018-07-24 23:02:43 UTC  ``` RHOSP 7.0 through 14.0 all exhibit this behaviour, so I am creating RHBZs for those versions, with the goal of downstream backports being performed for those releases too. In RHOSP 9.0 through 13.0, the function _validate_router_port_info is addressed by the linked upstream patch in OpenStack gerrit, potentially with small adjustments so everything applies cleanly. In addition, the neutron In RHOSP 7.0 and 8.0, the function _validate_router_port_info (which the upstream patches apply to) in db/l3_db.py had not been introduced, so does not exist in 7.0 and 8.0's l3_db.py - the simple validation logic is however consolidated in the _add_interface_by_port function in these older releases. Given no similar protection logic is present in these releases, I suggest that in order to address this for those releases, additional backporting work would be required to add validation to _add_interface_by_port.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c6)  Joshua Padman    2018-07-25 04:07:47 UTC  ``` Clearing my needinfo as James has suitably answered the query.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-17 16:46:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2018:2710 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2710](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2710)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-17 16:52:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2018:2715 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2715](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2715)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1607822#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-12-05 18:52:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike)  Via RHSA-2018:3792 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3792](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3792)   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-neutron security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2715)

## Topic

An update for openstack-neutron is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-neutron: A router interface out of subnet IP range results in a denial of service (CVE-2018-14635)

For more details about the security issue, including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* A new configuration option bridge\_mac\_table\_size has been added for the neutron OVS agent. This value is set on every Open vSwitch bridge managed by the openvswitch-neutron-agent. The value controls the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a bridge. The default value for this new option is 50,000, which should be enough for most systems. Values outside a reasonable range (10 to 1,000,000) might be overridden by Open vSwitch. (BZ#1589031)
* Previously, when a VM was destroyed, the IPv6 lease was not removed from dnsmasq lease files due to a missing dhcp\_release6 binary.

With this update, the dhcp\_release6 binary is now provided in an updated dnsmasq-utils package version. (BZ#1545006)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# IP address for a router interface allowed outside the allocation range of subnet

Bug #1757482 reported by

on 2018-03-21

### Bug Description

Currently running Queens on Ubuntu 16.04 with the linuxbridge ml2 plugin with vxlan overlays. We have a single, large provider network that we have set to 'shared' and 'external', so people who need to do things that don't work well with NAT can connect their instances directly to the provider network. Our 'allocation range' as defined in our provider subnet is dedicated to tenants, so there should be no conflicts.

One of our users connected a neutron router to the provider network (not via the 'external network' option, but rather via the normal 'add interface' option) and neglected to specify an IP address. The neutron router decided that it was now the gateway for the entire provider network and began arp'ing.

This seems like it should be disallowed inside of neutron (you shouldn't be able to specify an IP address for a router interface that isn't explicitly part of your allocation range on said subnet). Unless neutron just expect issues like this to be handled by the physical provider infrastructure (spoofing prevention, etc.)?

Thanks for reporting the issue. I suspect the issue should not be limited to linuxbridge. One part that's not clear is the sequence of commands you chose to plug the logical router on the network. If that was done through the CLI and using the add-interface command, that takes either a specific port or a subnet. In the latter case the IP ends up being auto-allocated from within the IP allocation pool. In the former case, that can be overridden but then it feels like the harm is somewhat self-inflicted?

Please consider providing more details so that it can help the triage efforts!

Armondo I will work on providing more detail for the issue. Received the below from Kevin Benton through the mailing list so wanted to add to the bug for additional feedback.

I think you might have uncovered an edge-case that should probably be filed as a bug against Neutron. If a router interface is attached using a reference to a subnet, it always tries to use the address in the "gateway\_ip" of the subnet:

<https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/282d3da614f24a6385c63a926a48845d3f6d72a3/neutron/db/l3_db.py#L797-L798>

My opinion is that Neutron probably shouldn't allow grabbing the default gateway if you aren't the owner of the subnet, but that is a fix that might not land for a while depending on their priorities.

In the meantime, I recommend that you create a neutron port as an admin on the public network using the gateway\_ip of the network to represent your real gateway router. This will prevent anyone from being able to attach a router using the subnet as a reference since the gateway\_ip address will already be in use.

All,

Want to provide some more detail here:

Let's say for example we create our provider network with the follow CLI command:

openstack subnet create --network public --allocation-pool start=10.50.20.0,end=10.50.255.100 --dns-nameserver 10.50.255.254 --gateway 10.50.255.254 --subnet-range 10.50.0.0/16 public\_subnet

One would imagine that tenants (who are not in the owning admin project) would not be able to allocate IP addresses to instances, routers, etc. that fall outside of the allocation range, so commands sequences such as:

openstack port create --fixed-ip ip-address=10.50.255.254 --network public foo-port

openstack router create bar-router

openstack router add port bar-router foo-port

would fail. As of now, they do not, and users can successfully create a port outside of the allocation range on networks they do not own. This can present a possible DoS condition as described above (unless the workaround described above is implemented, e.g. 'openstack port create --disable --fixed-ip ip-address=10.50.255.254 --network public dummy-public-gateway-port' as an admin.

I realize that we are accepting some risk by allowing users to create ports directly on the public network, but I do feel it is a valid use case, and neutron should not allow users to create ports on a network they do not own that is outside of the prescribed allocation range, much in the same way that neutron checks the db for already-allocated addresses before port creation. Applying the same logic would fix the issue from our perspective.

Also, want to add that the 'public' network in the above example was created in this manner, with the external and shared flags set:

openstack network create --external --share --provider-physical-network provider --provider-network-type flat public

Re-opened since [bug 1774019](/bugs/1774019) seems to be a duplicate. In that case a user was able to add a router to a shared external network and it got the .1 address. Looks like there is an edge case here we need to cover.

I completely agree with the comments from the reporter.

If you can specify a ip outside the range then you can ruin all kinds of things and cause major havock - even as just a user on the cloud with no special permissions.

I tested this seems like need to address another issue as comment 3 mentioned,

i created another subnet on public net with allocation\_pools | {"start": "10.50.20.0", "end": "10.50.255.100"}

then I was able to create port with fixed ip that was out of pool range.

it allowed to add that port to router interface.

I guess it shouldn't have let me create an port with ip out of pool range in first place, if I am correct.

this happens only for provider subnet. below is paste of all the command I ran and output.

    subnet's allocation pool, creating a security risk. This patch prevents

    tenants who are not the subnet's owner or admin from assigning a router

None of the branches which ever carried this bug are in a maintained state (the release in which the fix first appeared in under extended maintenance already), so there is little point in entertaining an advisory now. Switching the OSSA task to invalid.

commit 8619c104b886517266f5b7ae7d19816aa5764dc0

Author: Arnaud Morin <email address hidden>

Date: Mon May 30 15:40:45 2022 +0200

Allow shared net to be added on router

This will subnets from shared networks to be added on routers using:

    $ openstack router add subnet router\_id subnet\_id

Without this, neutron user must use a multi-router solution, which is

    not convenient at all.

Allow shared net to be added on router
This will subnets from shared networks to be added on routers using:

Without this, neutron user must use a multi-router solution, which is

### Disallow router interface out of subnet IP range

[Browse Source](/openstack/neutron/src/commit/54aa6e81cb17b33ce4d5d469cc11dec2869c762d)

```
Currently, a non privileged tenant can add a router interface to a
shared / external network's subnet with an IP address outside the
subnet's allocation pool, creating a security risk. This patch prevents
tenants who are not the subnet's owner or admin from assigning a router
interface an IP address outside the subnet's allocation pool.

If not, I will dig more why it's failing...   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c8)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-23 10:20:49 UTC  ``` <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/507856/> - patch for Pike proposed <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/500379/> - already in stable/Pike <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/501717/> - already in stable/Pike <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/501366/> - already in stable/Pike <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/493501/> - already in stable/Pike <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/383827/> - already in stable/Pike   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c9)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-23 10:32:22 UTC  ``` I also checked in OSP-12 repo, all patches which are already in stable/Pike are also in OSP-12 repo.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c10)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-25 09:18:58 UTC  ``` After backport of last missing patch to OSP-12 I checked this CI job and this test is still failing there. See: <https://rhos-qe-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/DFG-network-neutron-12_director-rhel-virthost-3cont_2comp-ipv4-vxlan-dvr/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/tempest-results/tempest-results-neutron.1.html>  So after checking logs from this job it looks for me that after migration to ha, router was transitioned to master on one node but FIP wasn't configured on this router after transition. I will now deploy OSP-12 env with 2 controllers and try to reproduce this issue manually.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c11)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-25 15:04:48 UTC  ``` I was wrong with those logs. FIP is added by keepalived process based on its config file. There is anything about that in L3 agent's logs as I checked locally.  I tried to reproduce same migration process manually and it was fine every time. So I couldn't reproduce this issue on my local env. I will have to try to connect to CI node with this job and try to debug there...   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c12)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-30 12:24:24 UTC  ``` I checked few runs of those tests on OSP-12 and I also deployed it on my node with our Jenkins CI. From what I found is that neutron.tests.tempest.scenario.test_migration.NetworkMigrationFromLegacy.test_from_legacy_to_ha is passing now (at least on my node deployed with Jenkins)  But I found that neutron.tests.tempest.scenario.test_migration.NetworkMigrationFromHA.test_from_ha_to_legacy is failing. And it is failing also in upstream stable/pike jobs, see e.g.: <http://logs.openstack.org/80/586980/1/check/legacy-tempest-dsvm-neutron-dvr-multinode-scenario/0dce998/logs/testr_results.html.gz>   So I think that we should find now the reason why this test is failing.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c13)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-07-30 12:56:18 UTC  ``` I just found that there is error

Unfortunately I'm not sure yet why it happens like that and I could reproduce it only when I run all migration tests together. If I run only this one test, it didn't fails for me :/  Ok, so what I found is:  MAC address of router’s port on contr-0 (active one) is fa:16:3e:2b:4c:ea  Controller-0 (active):  [root@controller-0

priority=2,dl_vlan=117,dl_dst=fa:16:3e:2b:4c:ea actions=strip_vlan,load:0x3e->NXM_NX_TUN_ID[],output:"vxlan-ac110213"  As it sends packages which should be send to fa:16:3e:2b:4c:ea to controller-2 instead of controller-0 on which there is this router configured now. Just for confirmation. I manually removed this one rule from br-tun and connection was fine.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c19)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-08-02 19:42:56 UTC  ``` I checked few times and when I run only this one test with migration from legacy to HA then everything works fine. I didn't found adding such fdb entries for this qr-XX port on compute node. It appears only when I run more tests in parallel. And I don't know why it is like that. I will continue debugging this issue in next days....   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c20)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-08-03 15:48:21 UTC  ``` I was testing this today and if I run all tests one by one or if I run only this one test, it's passing every time. When I run all tests with 4 workers - this one test if failing very often. I still don't know exactly why it is like that...  From logs analysis it looks that when all if fine, there is rpc message remove_fdb_entries send to agents when router is set to admin_state_up=False. But when test fails there is no this information in neutron-server's log file. So message is not send and because of that there is an issue with fdb entries.  But I still don't know why it isn't sent properly.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1539638#c21)  Slawek Kaplonski    2018-08-03 19:34:35 UTC  ``` So I did another test and what I found is (it's together with some my additional logs):  Router ID: b1da9aca-046a-4354-911d-6cf4832956be Router's port: cb31cdca-810b-45c8-a8b4-177c7f1aed09  So when legacy router is set to "DOWN", port should be also set to down.
