  "CVE-2018-14635": {
    "description": "OpenStack Networking (neutron) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service. A non-privileged tenant can add a router interface to a shared/external network's subnet with an IP address outside the subnet's allocation pool. This can result in a Denial of Service.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that non-privileged tenants were able to create and attach ports without specifying an IP address, bypassing IP address validation. Then, an IP address conflicting with existing guests or routers could be assigned from outside of the allowed allocation pool.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Insufficient access controls",
      "Lack of proper subnet IP range checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service can occur when a router interface is configured with an IP address outside of the subnet's allocation pool, leading to network disruptions and potentially impacting other services.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Exploiting OpenStack API vulnerabilities",
      "Attaching ports without IP address specification"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Non-privileged tenant access",
      "Ability to create and attach network ports",
      "Knowledge of a shared/external network's subnet"
    ],
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present when using the Linux bridge ml2 driver. The fix involves validating that the tenant attempting to assign a router interface with a specific IP address is the owner or an admin of the subnet and that the IP address falls within the defined allocation pool."
