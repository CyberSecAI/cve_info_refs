Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-14029

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the `/wity/admin/user/edit/1` page in WityCMS version 0.6.2. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly submitting a malicious request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application does not validate the origin of requests on the user edit page. Specifically, it's missing a CSRF token that should be included in the form submission, preventing a malicious user from crafting a request that appears legitimate to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Account Takeover:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can modify an administrator's account details, including the password and email address. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the administrator's account, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could send a phishing email to the administrator containing a link to a malicious page that automatically submits a crafted CSRF request.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** If an XSS vulnerability exists on the website, the attacker can inject malicious code into a page visited by the administrator, which will execute and initiate the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious website or inject malicious code.** The attacker needs a way to deliver the crafted CSRF request to the victim's browser.
- **Target user must be logged in:** The victim (administrator) needs to be logged into the WityCMS application for the CSRF attack to succeed.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit code that demonstrates how to create a malicious HTML page to trigger the vulnerability.
- The github issue #153 describes the vulnerability in detail and provides the same POC.
- The recommended mitigation is to require the original password to change the password and/or implement CSRF tokens.
