{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `sell` function due to multiplication of `amount` and `sellPrice` potentially exceeding the maximum value for `uint256`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Lack of proper input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The integer overflow can lead to an incorrect amount of Ether being transferred to the seller, potentially resulting in the contract sending less ether than expected. In scenarios where this leads to a zero value this could be exploited by the seller to receive tokens for free.",
  "Attack vectors": "Calling the `sell` function with a large `amount` after the contract owner has set a large `sellPrice` can cause the multiplication to overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to call the `sell` function and the contract owner would have to set the `sellPrice` to a large value."
