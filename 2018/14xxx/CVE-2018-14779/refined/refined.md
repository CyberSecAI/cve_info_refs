Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-14779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unchecked buffer in the `libykpiv` library, specifically within the `ykpiv_transfer_data()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow (CWE-120):** The code checks if the output buffer has enough space to hold the data to be copied, but it does not prevent the `memcpy()` operation from occurring if the buffer is too small. This leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could use a specially crafted USB device (masquerading as a YubiKey) to send malicious data that triggers the buffer overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** For affected versions of the YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver, the malicious code could execute with System-level privileges. For the Yubico PIV Tool and YubiKey PIV Manager, the malicious code would execute with the same privileges as the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to a computer with the vulnerable software installed.
*   **Malicious USB Device:** The attacker requires a custom-made malicious USB device that can impersonate a YubiKey and send crafted APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to create a malicious USB device capable of communicating with the targeted software.
*   Physical access to the target computer.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerability and how to trigger it with specific APDU data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `lib/ykpiv.c` within the function `ykpiv_transfer_data()`.
*   The check `if(*outlen + recvlen - 2 > maxout)` is present, but it does not prevent the `memcpy()` that causes the overflow.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious smartcard sends a crafted APDU response to the software.
*   The `libykpiv` library is used by multiple Yubico tools including:
    *   Yubico PIV Tool (command-line).
    *   YubiKey PIV Manager (GUI).
    *   YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver (Windows).
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.

**Mitigation**
*   Update libykpiv to version 1.6.0 or later
*   Update affected Yubico software (Yubico PIV Tool, YubiKey PIV Manager, YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver) to the latest versions
