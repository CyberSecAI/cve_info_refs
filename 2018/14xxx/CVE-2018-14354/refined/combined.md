Sept 18th 2004. The mailing lists are slowly coming back to life. Since the
failure of 6 days ago, mail has been stored. Approx figures are 25,000 mutt.org
emails of which 4,600 were viruses (virii) and about 35 actual list traffic.
Much being to invalid addresses and backscatter from forged mutt.org addresses.

However normality has now been restored (HHGTTG).

Mutt 1.4.2.1 was released on February 12, 2004. This release includes some
files which were missing from the 1.4.2 release.

Mutt 1.4.2 was released on February 11, 2004. This version fixes a buffer
overflow that can be triggered by incoming messages. There are reports about
spam that has actually triggered this problem and crashed mutt. It is
recommended that users of mutt versions prior to 1.4.2 upgrade to this
version, or apply the patch included below. Users of "unstable" mutt versions
after 1.3.28 (including 1.5.\*) do not need to upgrade, as this problem had been
fixed in the unstable branch in February 2002; unfortunately, the fix was not
backported before 1.4 was released.

Mutt 1.4.1 and 1.5.4 were released on March 19, 2003. These releases both fix
a **buffer overflow** identified by Core Security Technologies.
The only differences between 1.4 and 1.4.1 are bug fixes. If you are currently
using 1.4, it's probably a very good idea to update.

**Mutt 1.4** was released on May 29, 2002. This release has been
a long time coming, and users of older versions such as 1.2.x are encouraged to
take a look at 1.4 and the [changes](changes.html).

candidate** for 1.4.

Mutt 1.3.27 was released on January 22, 2002. This is the next
**beta** release toward the upcoming 1.4. This release fixes the
SSL core dump present in the short-lived 1.3.26.

Mutt 1.3.26 was released on January 18, 2002. This is the next
**beta** release toward the upcoming 1.4.

Mutt 1.2.5.1 and 1.3.25 were released on January 1, 2002. These releases both
fix a **security hole** which can be remotely exploited. For more

Mutt 1.3.24 was released on November 30, 2001. This is a **beta**
development release toward the next stable public release version. There have

Mutt 1.2.5 was released on July 28, 2000. This is the latest maintenance
update of the stable branch of mutt, and this time, we really suggest that you
update.

This release fixes at least one grave IMAP error which may lead to confusing
display and other strangeness, and our instances of the "wuftpd format bug",
which had (mostly) the effect that your IMAP server's operator could break into
your computer with some work.

Mutt 1.2.4 was released on July 7, 2000. This version fixes a couple of
problems present in 1.2.2, and one problem leading to crashes whose fix was
lacking from 1.2.3. We suggest that users of earlier versions upgrade to this
release of mutt.

Mutt 1.2.3 was released on July 7, 2000.

Mutt 1.2.2 was released on June 20, 2000. This version fixes a build problem
present with 1.2.1. If Mutt-1.2.1 is working for you, there is no need to
upgrade.

Mutt 1.2.1 was released on June 19, 2000.

**Mutt 1.2** was released on May 9, 2000. Note that
this version contains several significant changes, and users should
**not** upgrade without reading the
[release announcement](announce/mutt-1.2.html) and the
[README.UPGRADE](doc/README.UPGRADE-1.2) file.

Mutt 1.0.1 was released on January 19, 2000. Changes include a y2k fix for
dealing with odd dates from some mailers, and additional translations. There
is no reason to upgrade if you haven't experienced problems with 1.0.

**Mutt 1.0** was released on October 22, 1999. The
[release announcement](announce/mutt-1.0.asc) is
available.

Mutt 1.0pre4 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on October 11, 1999.

Mutt 1.0pre3 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on September 25, 1999. This fixes
the below mentioned buffer overflow, and users are urged to upgrade immediately.

A buffer overflow has been discovered in Mutt's text/enriched handler for both
the stable and unstable branches. It may be exploited by an attacker
constructing suitably formatted e-mail messages. A patch can be found
here, and new releases will be available shortly.

Mutt 1.0pre2 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) was released on September 1, 1999.

A serious security hole has been found in Mutt's handling of MIME content
types. All Mutt users are encouraged to upgrade to at least version 0.93.2
in order to correct the problem. For more information,
[check the CERT site](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-98.10.mime_buffer_overflows.html).

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Mutt, NeoMutt: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mutt and NeoMutt, the
worst of which allows for arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-client/mutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.10.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.10.1** |

| Package | **mail-client/neomutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20180716** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20180716** |

### Background

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client.

NeoMutt is a command line mail reader (or MUA). It’s a fork of Mutt
with added features.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mutt, and NeoMutt.
Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted mail
message or connect to malicious mail server using Mutt or NeoMutt,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or directory traversal
with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-client/mutt-1.10.1"

```

All NeoMuutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/neomutt-20180716"

```

### Properly quote IMAP mailbox names when (un)subscribing.

```

When handling automatic subscription (via $imap_check_subscribed), or
manual subscribe/unsubscribe commands, mutt generating a "mailboxes"
command but failed to properly escape backquotes.

Thanks to Jeriko One for the detailed bug report and patch, which this
commit is based upon.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [mutt](/security/cves?package=mutt) - text-based mailreader supporting MIME, GPG, PGP and threading

## Details

USN-3719-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Mutt. Unfortunately, the fixes were

not correctly applied to the packaging for Mutt in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

This update corrects the oversight.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Mutt incorrectly handled certain requests.

An attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2018-14358](/security/CVE-2018-14358), [CVE-2018-14353](/security/CVE-2018-14353) ,[CVE-2018-14357](/security/CVE-2018-14357))

It was discovered that Mutt incorrectly handled certain inputs.

An attacker could possibly use this to access or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-14355](/security/CVE-2018-14355), [CVE-2018-14356](/security/CVE-2018-14356), [CVE-2018-14351](/security/CVE-2018-14351),

[CVE-2018-14362](/security/CVE-2018-14362), [CVE-2018-14349](/security/CVE-2018-14349))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [mutt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mutt)
  -
  [1.5.24-1ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mutt/1.5.24-1ubuntu0.2)
* [mutt-patched](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mutt)
  -
  [1.5.24-1ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mutt/1.5.24-1ubuntu0.2)

After a standard system update you need to restart mutt to make all the

necessary changes.
