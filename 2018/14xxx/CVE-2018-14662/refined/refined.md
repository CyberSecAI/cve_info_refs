    "Metadata": {
      "Original Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ceph documentation stated that clients should use \"allow r\" mon caps, which grant full read access to all config-keys stored in the monitor, including LUKS encryption keys. This access was not restricted to the lockbox user.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect permission management allowing unauthorized access to dm-crypt/LUKS encryption keys."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user with read-only permissions could steal dm-crypt encryption keys used in Ceph disk encryption.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Network access via authenticated Ceph client"

      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be an authenticated Ceph user with read permissions."
    },
     "Additional Information": {
      "Additional details": "The vulnerability was present because of inadequate access control for ceph monitor config keys. With the 'allow r' permission, any authenticated Ceph user could potentially access any config key, including encryption keys used for disk encryption.",
