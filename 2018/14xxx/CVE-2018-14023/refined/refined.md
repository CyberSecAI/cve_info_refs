Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stemmed from the Signal Desktop application not properly clearing expired messages from its logs. Specifically:
    *   Initially, messages were not being removed from memory after expiration.
    *   Later, even after a fix that addressed the memory issue, expired messages were still recoverable from the IndexedDB due to messages not being predictably deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Expired Messages:** Expired messages were not reliably purged from the system's memory and logs.
*   **Failure to Delete from IndexedDB:** The IndexedDB did not predictably remove expired messages, leading to data persistence after intended expiration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Recovery of Expired Messages:** Attackers could potentially recover messages that were intended to be automatically deleted. This compromises the privacy and security of conversations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Memory Dumping:** In the initial version, messages could be recovered by dumping the memory of the Signal application.
*   **IndexedDB Analysis:**  Later, even after the memory issue was fixed, messages could still be recovered by examining the IndexedDB storage used by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker would need local access to the machine where the Signal Desktop application was running.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** The attacker would need technical expertise to perform tasks such as memory dumping and/or analyzing the application's IndexedDB storage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post details a vulnerability in Signal Desktop versions 1.14.3 and prior.
*   The issue was initially fixed partially in version 1.14.4, but a related issue persisted until version 1.15.0-beta.10, where the fix was finally complete.
*   The blog author created a Proof of Concept (PoC) video, linked in the article.
*   The author also mentions that they analyzed the open-source code to discover the flaws.
