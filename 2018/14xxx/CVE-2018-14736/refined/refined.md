- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs when writing to a string in `src/wmessage.c` at line 300 in the `pbc_wmessage_string` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Global buffer overflow. The code attempts to write data past the allocated boundary of a global variable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The program crashes due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the buffer overflow. The overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited without ASAN protection, but this is not mentioned directly in the report.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing data that results in writing a string that is too large. In the provided ASAN output, the overflow happens when processing the string "MOBILE" in the `addressbook.c` example. The vulnerability is triggered through the `test_wmessage` function and further by the `main` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `pbc_wmessage_string` function that exceeds the allocated buffer size, which is determined by how the `addressbook.c` test program uses the `pbc` library. Specifically, the data is processed by function `pbc_wmessage_string`.
