{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the `batchTransfer` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `batchTransfer` function calculates the total transfer amount by multiplying the number of receivers by the value to be transferred. If the multiplication results in an integer overflow, the check will be bypassed because the resulting amount will be very small. ",
        "The contract calculates the total amount of tokens to transfer and checks that the amount should not be zero, but this check is useless due to integer overflow potential."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this integer overflow to transfer tokens to multiple addresses, but only have the contract deduct a very small amount of tokens from their balance, effectively minting tokens. Additionally, the attacker could manipulate balances of any user to any value.",
    "attack_vectors": "The `batchTransfer` function can be called by any user, allowing any user to exploit the integer overflow by sending tokens to a carefully chosen number of receivers with a large enough transfer value to cause the overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have multiple addresses and be able to call the `batchTransfer` function with a crafted `_receivers` array length and a large enough `_value` to cause the integer overflow in the `amount` calculation."
  },
  "affected_code": [
    "function batchTransfer(address[] _receivers, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {",
    "    uint256 cnt = _receivers.length;",
    "    uint256 amount = cnt * _value;",
    "    if(amount == 0) return false;",
    "    if(balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount) return false;",
    "    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;",
    "    for (uint i = 0; i < cnt; i++) {",
    "        balanceOf[_receivers[i]] += _value;",
    "        Transfer(msg.sender, _receivers[i], _value);",
    "        }",
    "    return true;",
    "}"

    "additional_notes": "The provided content also lists similar vulnerabilities in other contracts which also suffer from integer overflow issues within their batch transfer or similar functions. These additional vulnerabilities include Malaysia coins(Xmc), MP3 Coin(MP3), Neo Genesis Token(NGT), WeMediaChain(WMC), Rocket Coin(XRC), and GlobeCoin(GLB)."
