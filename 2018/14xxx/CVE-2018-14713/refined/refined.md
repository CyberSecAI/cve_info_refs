Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `nvram_match` family of hooks in the `/appGet.cgi` endpoint.
*   The output string argument of these hooks is vulnerable to format string attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-provided format specifiers (like `%p`, `%n`) in the output string argument of the `nvram_match` family of hooks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use format specifiers like `%p` to leak information from the call stack (e.g., register values, stack memory).
*   **Arbitrary Memory Write:** By using the format specifier `%n`, an attacker can write data to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/appGet.cgi` endpoint, specifically using the `nvram_match` family of hooks.
*   The crafted request includes format string specifiers in the output string argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the `/appGet.cgi` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the `nvram_match` family of hooks and how to manipulate the output string argument.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**
* The vulnerability exists in ASUSWRT version 3.0.0.4.382.50010 and earlier versions.
* The blog post mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with CVE-2018-14712 (stack buffer overflow) to achieve reliable remote code execution.
