The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14589.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in `AP4_Mp4AudioDsiParser::ReadBits` function due to an out-of-bounds read. This is triggered while parsing an MP4 file with a crafted audio sample description.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The program attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer in `AP4_Mp4AudioDsiParser::ReadBits`, resulting in a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a program crash, making the `mp4info` tool unusable when processing the specific crafted MP4 file.
- Potential for further exploitation: While the immediate impact is a crash, heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited for arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific memory layout and exploitation techniques. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided content.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious MP4 file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted MP4 file, specifically when parsing the audio sample description.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application (mp4info) for processing. No specific privilege or access is mentioned besides being able to provide this input file to the vulnerable program.
