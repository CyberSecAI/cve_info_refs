- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs in `AP4_MemoryByteStream::WritePartial` function, when writing to the `EmptyString` global variable, which is only 1 byte in size, but the `memcpy` writes 28 bytes to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Global buffer overflow. The `memcpy` operation writes data beyond the allocated size of the `EmptyString` variable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The crash report shows that AddressSanitizer detects a global-buffer-overflow, resulting in program termination. In a real-world scenario, such an overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior if not detected.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a malformed MP4 file, the `mp4info` tool attempts to write data beyond the bounds of a global variable during processing, leading to the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers the vulnerable code path in `mp4info`. The attacker would need to get the vulnerable application (`mp4info` in this case) to parse a malicious MP4 file under their control.
