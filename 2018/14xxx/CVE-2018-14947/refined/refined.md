Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2018-14947:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an alloc-dealloc-mismatch in the `CSStyle` function within the `XmlFontAccu` class of the pdf2json software. This means memory allocated using one method (`operator new[]`) is later freed using an incompatible method (`operator delete`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion/Memory Corruption**: The core issue is that `operator new[]` and `operator delete` are mismatched, leading to memory corruption.
- **AddressSanitizer (ASAN) error:** ASAN detects the error as "alloc-dealloc-mismatch (operator new [] vs operator delete)".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Program Crash/Abortion:** The AddressSanitizer detects the memory corruption and aborts the program execution. This can lead to a denial of service.
- **Potential for further exploitation**: While the provided information only describes a crash, such memory corruption vulnerabilities can be further exploited to gain control of program execution, leading to more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file (`alloc_dealloc_mismatch_CSStyle.pdf`).
- **Command-line Interface:** The `pdf2json` tool is used to convert the malicious PDF to JSON via the command line interface: `./pdf2json alloc_dealloc_mismatch_CSStyle.pdf 1.json`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable `pdf2json` tool. This could be done by tricking a user into processing a malicious PDF, through a website that uses the tool or other methods where the attacker can control the input to `pdf2json`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is detected using Clang 6.0 and AddressSanitizer, which pinpoints the exact location and type of the memory error.
- The ASAN output clearly shows the allocation and deallocation call stacks.
- The vulnerable code is in `/home/fouzhe/my_fuzz/pdf2json/src/XmlFonts.cc:392` and `/home/fouzhe/my_fuzz/pdf2json/src/XmlFonts.cc:363`
- The provided information also mentions another related vulnerability `CVE-2018-14946` caused by a similar allocation mismatch in the `~HtmlString` function.
