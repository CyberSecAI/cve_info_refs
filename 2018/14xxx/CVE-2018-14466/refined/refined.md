Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer over-read present in the `print-rx.c` file, specifically within the `rx_cache_find()` and `rx_cache_insert()` functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The Rx parser in tcpdump incorrectly accesses memory beyond the allocated buffer while handling the serviceId field of the rx_header structure. It tries to read 32 bits, but the serviceId is only 16 bits long, causing a read past the end of the field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the `tcpdump` application, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted network packets. The attack vector is through network traffic that is parsed by `tcpdump`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need the ability to send a specifically crafted network packet with a malformed RX header that would cause tcpdump to over-read.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `serviceId` field of the `rx_header` structure is read as a 32-bit integer instead of a 16-bit integer in the `rx_cache_insert()` and `rx_cache_find()` functions.
*   The fix involves reading the serviceId field as a 16-bit integer using EXTRACT_16BITS() instead of EXTRACT_32BITS().
*   The vulnerability is fixed in tcpdump version 4.9.3.
