Fixed out of boundary write (CVE-2018-14600).The length value is interpreted as signed char on many systems
(depending on default signedness of char), which can lead to an out of
boundary write up to 128 bytes in front of the allocated storage, but
limited to NUL byte(s).
Casting the length value to unsigned char fixes the problem and allows
string values with up to 255 characters.

Package        : libx11
Version        : 2:1.6.2-3+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-14598 CVE-2018-14599 CVE-2018-14600

Several issues were discovered in libx11, the client interface to the
X Windows System. The functions XGetFontPath, XListExtensions, and
XListFonts are vulnerable to an off-by-one override on malicious
server responses. A malicious server could also send a reply in which
the first string overflows, causing a variable set to NULL that will
be freed later on, leading to a segmentation fault and Denial of
Service. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c interprets a
variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds
write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to a Denial of Service or possibly
remote code execution.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2:1.6.2-3+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libx11 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-28 20:07:56 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. Functions ListExt.c:XListExtensions and GetFPath.c:XGetFontPath interpret a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to DoS or remote code execution.   References: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/08/21/6> <https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2018-August/002916.html>   Upstream Patch: <https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/commit/?id=dbf72805fd9d7b1846fe9a11b46f3994bfc27fea>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-28 20:08:29 UTC  ``` Created libX11 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1623243](show_bug.cgi?id=1623243 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-14600 libX11: Out of Bounds write in XListExtensions in ListExt.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-08-31 13:42:15 UTC  ``` Functions ListExt.c:XListExtensions and GetFPath.c:XGetFontPath interpret the length field, which is a char, as a signed value, resulting in a read and a write before the intended buffer when they traverse the list of extensions/paths provided by the server.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c6)  Shiva Prasad Rao    2019-01-29 23:32:20 UTC  ```  Is the fix going to be ported to RHEL 7?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:11:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2079 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2079](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2079)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 19:19:39 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-14600>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1623242#c12)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-12-03 17:01:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would need to have already compromised the X server used by your applications. Normally, the X client that runs libX11 and the X server runs on the same machine, thus if an attacker can trigger this flaw he has already compromised the X server, which runs as root, and he has already full control on the system. If the X client runs on another system than the X server (e.g. DISPLAY environment variable is used and it points to an X server on another system) then exploiting this vulnerability would only gain the privileges of the client, which should not be run with high privileges.  For the above reasons, this flaw was rated as Moderate Impact.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1623250#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-28 20:18:13 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. Functions GetFPath.c:XGetFontPath, ListExt.c:XListExtensions and FontNames.c:XListFonts are vulnerable to an off-by-one error when parsing list of strings returned by malicious server responses, leading to DoS.

Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-14599>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1623250#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-12-03 17:01:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of libX11 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as they did not include the vulnerable code.  To exploit the vulnerability an attacker would need to have already compromised the X server used by your applications. Normally, the X client that runs libX11 and the X server runs on the same machine, thus if an attacker can trigger this flaw he has already compromised the X server, which runs as root, and he has already full control on the system. If the X client runs on another system than the X server (e.g. DISPLAY environment variable is used and it points to an X server on another system) then exploiting this vulnerability would only gain the privileges of the client, which should not be run with high privileges. For the above reasons, this flaw was rated as Moderate Impact.   ``` |  |

Date: Tue, 21 Aug 2018 17:50:22 +0200
From: Matthieu Herrb <matthieu@...rb.eu>

Subject: X.Org security advisory: August 21, 2018

X.Org security advisory: August 21, 2018

Multiple issues in libX11
=========================

The functions XGetFontPath, XListExtensions and XListFonts from libX11
are vulnerable to three different issues:

Off-by-one writes (CVE-2018-14599).
-----------------------------------

The functions XGetFontPath, XListExtensions, and XListFonts are
vulnerable to an off-by-one override on malicious server responses.

The server replies consist of chunks consisting of a length byte
followed by actual string, which is not NUL-terminated.

While parsing the response, the length byte is overridden with '\0',
thus the memory area can be used as storage of C strings later on. To
be able to NUL-terminate the last string, the buffer is reserved with
an additional byte of space.

For a boundary check, the variable chend (end of ch) was introduced,
pointing at the end of the buffer which ch initially points to.
Unfortunately there is a difference in handling "the end of ch".

While chend points at the first byte that must not be written to,
the for-loop uses chend as the last byte that can be written to.

Therefore, an off-by-one can occur.

Out of boundary write (CVE-2018-14600).
---------------------------------------

The length value is interpreted as signed char on many systems
(depending on default signedness of char), which can lead to an out of
boundary write up to 128 bytes in front of the allocated storage, but
limited to NUL byte(s).

Casting the length value to unsigned char fixes the problem and allows
string values with up to 255 characters.

Crash on invalid reply (CVE-2018-14598).
----------------------------------------

If the server sends a reply in which even the first string would
overflow the transmitted bytes, list[0] (or flist[0]) will be set to
NULL and a count of 0 is returned.

If the resulting list is freed with XFreeExtensionList or
XFreeFontPath later on, the first Xfree call:

    Xfree (list[0]-1)
 turns into
    Xfree (NULL-1)

which will most likely trigger a segmentation fault.

Patches
=======

Patches for these issues have been commited to the libX11 git repository.
libX11 1.6.6 will be released shortly and will include those patches.

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11>

Thanks
======

X.Org thanks Tobias Stoeckmann for reporting these issues to our
security team and assisting them in understanding them and evaluating
our fixes.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:
