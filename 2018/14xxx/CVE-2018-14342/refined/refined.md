      "root_cause": "The BGP dissector could enter a large loop due to missing validation of Path Attribute lengths.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing input validation",
        "Infinite loop"

      "impact": "A malformed packet or a malformed packet trace file can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire",
        "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
