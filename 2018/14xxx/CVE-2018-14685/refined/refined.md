Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `admin_ff_url_repalce` function in `/WWW/gxlcms/Lib/Common/Admin/function.php` and its usage in the `add` function in `/www/Lib/Lib/Action/Admin/TplAction.class.php`. The `admin_ff_url_repalce` function performs a simple string replacement, substituting characters like `|`, `@`, and `#` with `/`, `=`, and `&` respectively. This allows an attacker to bypass path restrictions and access arbitrary files on the server. Specifically, the `add` function takes user input (`$_GET['id']`), processes it through `admin_ff_url_repalce`, and then uses the result in a `read_file` call without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file read vulnerability, meaning an attacker can read any file accessible by the web server process.
* **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `admin_ff_url_repalce` function, instead of sanitizing user input, merely transforms specific characters, enabling path traversal attacks.
* **Lack of Path Validation:** The application does not validate the file path before using it in the `read_file` function.
* **Reliance on user controlled data:** The application directly uses user input from the `id` parameter in the GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, such as configuration files (`config.php`), database credentials, and other application source code, leading to sensitive information disclosure.
* **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information can be used to gain further access to the system or compromise the application.
* **Account Compromise:**  Reading files like `install.sql` could expose administrator passwords/accounts, allowing the attacker to completely take over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the application, specifically targeting the `/index.php` entry point.
* **Manipulated `id` Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious `id` parameter in the URL to specify the target file for reading, using the `|` character to be transformed to `/` by `admin_ff_url_repalce`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send HTTP requests.
* **Understanding of Application Structure:** The attacker needs to understand the application's URL structure, specifically the parameters processed by the vulnerable function (`s`, and `id` in this case).
* **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functionality:** The attacker should know about the vulnerable function and how to exploit it, i.e., the character replacements by `admin_ff_url_repalce`

**Examples of Exploitation:**
The content provides two examples demonstrating the vulnerability:

* `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?s=Admin-Tpl-ADD-id-.|Runtime|Conf||config*php` - Reads the website's configuration file.
* `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?s=Admin-Tpl-ADD-id-.|Runtime|Install||install*sql` - Reads the database installation file containing administrator credentials.
