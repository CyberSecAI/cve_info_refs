{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ResourceManager in Mojarra does not properly validate the 'loc' request parameter, allowing for path traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation of the 'loc' request parameter in the getLocalePrefix method of ResourceManager.java. The code checks for null and if the localePrefix is not null, it should return localePrefix, but it does not have any sanitization. After this patch, it checks if the localePrefix contains any forbidden sequence using the nameContainsForbiddenSequence method.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP request with a 'loc' parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., '../'), an attacker can manipulate the application's resource loading logic.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the 'loc' parameter."
