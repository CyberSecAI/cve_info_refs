The provided content discusses three vulnerabilities found in the 3CX web service, and explicitly mentions CVE-2018-14907 as one of them.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Improper Error Handling:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application exposes traceback errors, potentially revealing sensitive information about the server.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate error handling and insufficient sanitization of error outputs.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of server details, potentially aiding further attacks.

2.  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user input in the `TimeZoneName` parameter of the `/api/CallLog` endpoint.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application's response, potentially stealing user cookies or performing other malicious actions within the user's browser context.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the `TimeZoneName` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click a malicious link or embed the link on a webpage the victim visits.

3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Stack Trace:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application doesn't sanitize user-controlled input within the `propertyPath` parameter of the `/app/ivr_editor/4` endpoint, leading to XSS in a stack trace.
     *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and output encoding within stack traces.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the stack trace, which may lead to a variety of attacks if the stack trace is displayed in the user's browser context.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the `propertyPath` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click a malicious link or embed the link on a webpage the victim visits.
