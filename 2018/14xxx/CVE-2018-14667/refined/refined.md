  "CVE-2018-14667": {
    "Description": "The RichFaces Framework 3.X through 3.3.4 is vulnerable to Expression Language (EL) injection via the UserResource resource. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code using a chain of java serialized objects via org.ajax4jsf.resource.UserResource$UriData.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Expression Language (EL) injection vulnerability in the RichFaces Framework due to insecure handling of user input within the UserResource component.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Expression Language (EL) injection",
      "Insecure deserialization of Java objects",
      "Lack of proper input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Maliciously crafted serialized Java objects",
      "Exploiting the UserResource component within RichFaces"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for the initial attack.",
	"Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from the `UserResource` component, which deserializes data based on whitelisted classes. However, the issue arises when a specially-crafted object with a tainted EL expression bypasses whitelist protections, resulting in arbitrary code execution via deserialization."
