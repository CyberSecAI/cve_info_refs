The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when displaying tooltips for member fields within the Subrion CMS. Specifically, the tooltip value was not being escaped before being rendered in HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the tooltip field.
- When a user views the page containing the tooltip, the attacker's JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser.
- This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing other unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Add member field - tooltip" functionality, where an attacker can input the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add or edit member fields. This likely requires administrator or other privileged access to the Subrion CMS panel.
- The attacker would need to be able to navigate to the member fields section and add or edit an existing one, injecting the malicious payload in the tooltip field.
