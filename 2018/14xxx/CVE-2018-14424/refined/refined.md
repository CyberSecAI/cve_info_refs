Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-14424:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the GNOME Display Manager (GDM). Specifically, GDM fails to properly unexport display objects from its D-Bus interface when these objects are destroyed. This happens because the "display-removed" signal is emitted after the `GdmDisplay` object has already been removed from the store.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The core weakness is a use-after-free condition. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior and security risks.
- Improper object management: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of display objects within the GDM's D-Bus interface, particularly around the lifecycle of these objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash GDM, leading to a denial of service.
- Arbitrary code execution: There is a potential for arbitrary code execution, meaning an attacker could potentially run malicious programs with the privileges of the GDM process, which usually has administrator or root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: This vulnerability is triggered by a local, unprivileged user.
- D-Bus method calls: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted sequence of D-Bus method calls to the GDM daemon.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where GDM is running.
- They need to be able to interact with the GDM daemon through the D-Bus interface.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves passing the display object itself rather than just the ID in the "display-removed" signal. This ensures that the correct object is unexported from the bus and prevents use-after-free issues.
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of GDM and has been addressed in subsequent updates by Debian and Ubuntu.
