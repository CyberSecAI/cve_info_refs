Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Odoo module-description renderer not disabling the reStructuredText (RST) directive for local file inclusion. RST allows the inclusion of local system files, which can be abused if not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and read local files through the RST directive within module descriptions. This arises because the module description renderer doesn't deactivate the relevant RST feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve the contents of local files accessible to the Odoo service user, potentially exposing sensitive information like passwords, configuration data, and other confidential data.
- **System Compromise:** Accessing Odoo configuration files could allow further attacks on the system if these files contain credentials or other exploitable information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is network exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged User Account:** Exploitation requires a privileged user account within the Odoo instance. This means that the attacker must already have elevated access within the application.

**Additional Details**
- **Affected Versions:** Odoo Community and Enterprise editions 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** The provided text suggests applying patches or updating to the latest versions to address the vulnerability. It also advises using filesystem-level permissions as a workaround, although it's strongly recommended to patch the system instead, as relying on permissions alone is difficult to secure effectively.
- **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 score of 6.8 is assigned to this vulnerability, classified as medium severity. The CVSS vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- **Patch Information:** Specific commit hashes are provided for the different affected versions, linking directly to the fixes on GitHub.
- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was reported by Stephane Bidoul (ACSONE SA).
