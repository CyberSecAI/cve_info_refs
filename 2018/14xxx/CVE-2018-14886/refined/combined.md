## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32513#issue-430456802)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-13

The module-description renderer in Odoo Community 11.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 and earlier does not disable RST's local file inclusion, which allows privileged authenticated users to read local files via a crafted module description.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Core

**Credits**: Stephane Bidoul (ACSONE SA)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14886](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14886)

## I. Background

The description of Odoo modules can be written in several formats, including

reStructuredText (RST) format. RST syntax provides a directive to include local

system files, as a way to reuse text components.

## II. Problem Description

The directive to include local system files is not deactivated by the module

description renderer.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Privileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.8

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

An attacker with a privileged user account could craft a fake module

description in order to retrieve the content of local files that may contain

sensitive information.

This could be used to access the contents of Odoo configuration files and other

system files readable by the Odoo service, which could include sensitive data

such as passwords.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can only access files readable

by the system user executing Odoo. Sensitive files might therefore be

protected by using filesystem-level permissions to block access to the

Odoo user.

It is very hard to effectively secure a system in this manner, so

applying the patch or updating is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [9b4dfd9](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/9b4dfd99783447fb2aec6028880805e5050a4655)
* 10.0: [4c7e74f](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4c7e74f5e93a4832db8b8e15beb70a4aa90b2eee)
* 11.0: [7fbf7e2](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/7fbf7e233ce9ca485ef89f90872042a0a247274e)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.

* #### [[FIX] core: inherit translations better when upgrade](/odoo/odoo/commit/f63d0b548fa36b07563198653fcf144fe1be7b2f "[FIX] core: inherit translations better when upgrade Before: The typofix feature treats terms in the old and new values with similar text content as the same term, migrating the translations of the old term to the new term. For example The old value has the mapping: 'Draft': 'Brouillon' The new value contains the term: '<span invisible=\"name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\">Draft</span>' Since the old term and the new term share the same text content, 'Draft', after `write`, the new term reuses the old translation of 'Draft'. However, the translation 'Brouillon' is always visible, unlike its en_US counterpart. This behavior is acceptable in non-upgrade mode because the user writes the en_US value and is responsible for verifying translations afterward. However, it is problematic during upgrades because users cannot easily identify which records have changed and need to be rechecked. After: 'state' is removed from MODIFIER_ATTRS since it is not customized by Odoo The translation inheritance behavior can be described as below Translations can be inherited after `write` from old terms to new terms which share the very close text contents 1. when `write` in production mode, text contents for translation terms are more important than the HTML/XML structures of them, and the old term translations should be remained as much as possible. Because * the writing user is responsible to recheck all translations after `write`. * it is easier for the writing user to copy technical HTML/XML structures than translate text contents for a language they may not know. * the feature can also be used as typofix when the only small diff is the text content 2. when `write` in upgrade time, the HTML/XML structure is more important than the text content, and the new term structure should be remained as much as possible. Because * HTML/XML structures might be changed a lot after upgrade, which may contain behavior relevant diff (e.g. `invisible`), even if text contents are not changed. * users have no idea which records' values are changed during upgrade and are hard to recheck their translations. * new terms are highly likely to be correctly translated in the latest po files which will be imported during upgrade. * the typofix feature can still be remained when the only small diff is the text content Based on the above feature analysis, we use the below new strategy 1. translations can be inherited only if the old source term and the new source term share the same HTML/XML structure 2. translations can be inherited only if the old translation term and the new source term share the same HTML/XML structure 3. when translations are inherited, MODIFIER_ATTRS will be synchronized with the new source term, other attributes will be copied from the source term if available. closes odoo/odoo#195170 Forward-port-of: #194181 X-original-commit: 1f9095727d1a8a60fd9d1af73539947dae10415e Signed-off-by: Raphael Collet <rco@odoo.com> Signed-off-by: Chong Wang (cwg) <cwg@odoo.com>")

Will be used by default in all flows for MyInvois, with fallback on the Tax ID if empty. - Classification code on invoice line, making the use of products optional. - Rework the views for all fields related to ID on res.partner to align with other similar fields. They will be Readonly on res.partner with a parent id, but displays the value of the commercial partner. - Industrial classification on the partner. - \"Full\" support of self billing. - Reworked flow to send to MyInvois BEFORE send & print.

Steps to Reproduce: =========================== 1. Create a Bill of Materials (BOM) with the type set to 'Subcontracting'. 2. Create a Purchase Order (PO) for the product associated with the BOM. 3. Navigate to the receipt for that PO. 4. Observe that the 'Detailed Operation' button appears twice for each move.

This journal entry was reconciled with the invoice, triggering `invoice_paid_hook` as the invoice transitioned from `not_paid` to `in_payment`. `_reconcile_pre_hook` filtered out payments already marked as `in_payment` to avoid double-triggering `invoice_paid_hook`. However, since the default outstanding account is no longer assigned automatically, `invoice_paid_hook` is not triggered when an invoice transitions from `not_paid` to `in_payment` and then to `paid` by reconciling it with a bank statement line. - to address this issue we edited `_reconcile_pre_hook` and `_reconcile_post_hook` to handle in payment invoices in these cases.

However, the untaxed amount is 200 and both taxes have a base of 100. -------------------------------------------------------- Fix the base amount when there is no tax. -------------------------------------------------------- Suppose 2 lines having quantity=12.12, price_unit=12.12 => The expected base amount is round(12.12 * 12.12 * 2) ~= 293.79 However, the current dispatching of taxes is only done when there is a tax set. -------------------------------------------------------- Automatic fallback of the currency. -------------------------------------------------------- When converting the record to a base line, automatically compute the currency_id by looking to a company_currency_id or company_id field. -------------------------------------------------------- Fix the untaxed amount in case of cash rounding line. -------------------------------------------------------- Suppose a line of 15.68, cash rounding 0.05 half-up. The untaxed amount returned by the tax totals was 16.70 with a cash rounding amount of 0.02. However, 16.70 + 0.02 = 16.72... it's confusing for the user. Let's subtract the cash rounding amount from the untaxed amount to get 16.68 + 0.02 = 16.70. -------------------------------------------------------- Add a global delta base amount -------------------------------------------------------- Dispatch the delta of base amounts accross the base lines. Suppose 2 lines: - quantity=12.12, price_unit=12.12, tax=23% - quantity=12.12, price_unit=12.12, tax=13% The base amount of each line is computed as round(12.12 * 12.12) = 146.89 The expected base amount of the whole document is round(12.12 * 12.12 * 2) = 293.79 Currently, the base amount has already been rounded per tax. So the tax details for the whole document is currently: 23%: base = 146.89, tax = 33.79 13%: base = 146.89, tax = 19.1 However, for the whole document, there is a delta in term of base amount: 293.79 - 146.89 - 146.89 = 0.01 This delta won't be there in any base but still has to be accounted. In mexico, this is absolutely necessary to make the CFDI passing all the time. -------------------------------------------------------- Start the test suite for the Portuguese certification. -------------------------------------------------------- To use Odoo in Portugal, we have to get a certification that is mainly based on the results given by our taxes computation. This is currently a work in progress but this commit contains the beginning of the test suite to get this certification. closes odoo/odoo#195062 Forward-port-of: #191402 X-original-commit: 563b82e7dd43741d5e5438dda5dabe737c64fea8 Related: odoo/enterprise#77770 Signed-off-by: Laurent Smet (las) <las@odoo.com>")

* #### [[IMP] odoo: add config for cron connection time](/odoo/odoo/commit/e140c934621ab99f2a522318dd7513b0751258c0 "[IMP] odoo: add config for cron connection time Adds a configuration that can be used to mitigate PostgreSQL transactional errors with long-living connections and the `LISTEN/NOTIFY`[1] functionality by re-establishing the database connection periodically. In the case that a connection outlives the transaction wraparound[2] mechanism of postgres, the `LISTEN/NOTIFY` internal queue might contain references to transactions that have already been deleted by the system's (or a manual) `VACUUM`[3] as it has its own transaction validity mechanisms (roughly comparing transaction ids). This can be reproduced by: - Triggering a wraparound _AND_ cleaning of pg_xact between the cron's `LISTEN` + `COMMIT` and its recyling. - Having done at least one `NOTIFY` during that time period (?). - Try to `LISTEN` to the same channel on the same database (transaction id must be < than the first connection's transaction id). The following is an example error message: ``` ERROR database odoo.service.server: Worker (3194772) Exception occurred, exiting...
