# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

                 CVE-2018-19361 CVE-2018-19362 CVE-2019-12086

Multiple security issues were found in jackson-databind, a Java library
to parse JSON and other data formats which could result in information
disclosure or the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.

For the detailed security status of jackson-databind please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jackson-databind>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Applications that link only slf4j versions including that fix are not vulnerable to this vulnerability.  Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle slf4j-ext jar.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c11)  James Hebden    2019-02-14 05:18:02 UTC

Package        : jackson-databind
Version        : 2.4.2-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-11307 CVE-2018-12022 CVE-2018-12023 CVE-2018-14718
                 CVE-2018-14719 CVE-2018-14720 CVE-2018-14721 CVE-2018-19360
                 CVE-2018-19361 CVE-2018-19362

Several deserialization flaws were discovered in jackson-databind, a fast
and powerful JSON library for Java, which could allow an unauthenticated
user to perform code execution. The issue was resolved by extending
the blacklist and blocking more classes from polymorphic deserialization.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.2-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# RHSA-2019:1822 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Decision Manager 7.4.0 Security Update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat Decision Manager.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Decision Manager is an open source decision management platform that combines business rules management, complex event processing, Decision Model & Notation (DMN) execution, and Business Optimizer for solving planning problems. It automates business decisions and makes that logic available to the entire business.

This release of Red Hat Decision Manager 7.4.0 serves as an update to Red Hat Decision Manager 7.3.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* jackson-databind: Potential information exfiltration with default typing, serialization gadget from MyBatis (CVE-2018-11307)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Jodd-db library (CVE-2018-12022)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver (CVE-2018-12023)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class (CVE-2018-14718)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes (CVE-2018-14719)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in axis2-transport-jms class (CVE-2018-19360)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in openjpa class (CVE-2018-19361)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in jboss-common-core class (CVE-2018-19362)
* jackson-databind: exfiltration/XXE in some JDK classes (CVE-2018-14720)
* jackson-databind: server-side request forgery (SSRF) in axis2-jaxws class (CVE-2018-14721)
* xstream: remote code execution due to insecure XML deserialization (CVE-2019-10173, regression of CVE-2013-7285)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

## Solution

For on-premise installations, before applying the update, back up your existing installation, including all applications, configuration files, databases and database settings, and so on.

It is recommended to halt the server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this update; after installing the update, restart the server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must log in to download the update).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# JBoss Fuse Integration Services on Fuse 6.3 Patch Release Notes

Updated 2020-02-24T13:47:46+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

This article provides the details around our JBoss Fuse Integration Services patches.

The intention of this article is provide the [details](#versions) on the relevant releases that you may need to apply the maintenance as well as document the associated fixes. For information on how to apply the patches, please refer to the [Patching Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/6.3/html/fuse_integration_services_2.0_for_openshift/patching).

These patches may have three different components and each will detail the issues resolved:

[Application Dependency Updates](#application)

[Image Updates](#images)

[Template Updates](#templates)

Patch releases are typically driven by application dependency updates. The following table highlights the relationship between the different versions. Note images may be released outside of a major patch release and will be documented in the [Image Updates](#images) section.

# **Versions**

This section documents the versions for the different components for major patch releases.

# RHSA-2019:3140 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data spread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML files, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local database.

This release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.8 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.4.7, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.

Security Fix(es):

* thrift: Improper file path sanitization in t\_go\_generator.cc:format\_go\_output() of the go client library can allow an attacker to inject commands (CVE-2016-5397)
* tika-core: tika: Command injection in tika-server can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted headers (CVE-2018-1335)
* slf4j: Deserialisation vulnerability in EventData constructor can allow for arbitrary code execution (CVE-2018-8088)
* jackson-databind: Potential information exfiltration with default typing, serialization gadget from MyBatis (CVE-2018-11307)
* libthrift: thrift: Improper Access Control grants access to files outside the webservers docroot path (CVE-2018-11798)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Jodd-db library (CVE-2018-12022)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization of types from Oracle JDBC driver (CVE-2018-12023)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class (CVE-2018-14718)
* jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes (CVE-2018-14719)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in axis2-transport-jms class (CVE-2018-19360)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in openjpa class (CVE-2018-19361)
* jackson-databind: improper polymorphic deserialization in jboss-common-core class (CVE-2018-19362)
* zookeeper: Information disclosure in Apache ZooKeeper (CVE-2019-0201)

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:
