{
  "CVE-2018-14625": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists between the `connect()` and `close()` functions when using the AF_VSOCK protocol.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker may be able to perform an uncontrolled read to kernel memory from within a VM guest. This can lead to a 4-byte information leak, possibly allow an attacker to intercept or corrupt AF_VSOCK messages destined to other clients, or leak kernel memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker in a guest virtual machine."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to exploit the race condition by using the AF_VSOCK protocol within a virtual machine."
