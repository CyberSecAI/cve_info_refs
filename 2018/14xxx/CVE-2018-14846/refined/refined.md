  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of user inputs within the 'Multi Step Form' WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin stores values without proper validation or escaping.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code through stored XSS attacks, potentially leading to the theft of user's personal data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability exists within the `class-mondula-multistep-forms-admin.php` file, in the `fw_wizard_save` action.",
      "Unsanitized user inputs from the following parameters: `data[wizard][steps][0][title]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][headline]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][copy_text]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][title]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][0][label]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][0][format]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][1][label]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][2][label]`, `data[wizard][steps][0][parts][0][blocks][3][label]`, `data[wizard][settings][thankyou]`."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. They can then inject the malicious script through the Multi Step Form builder, which is then saved into the database and executed when the form is rendered.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found in version 1.2.5 of the plugin. A fix was released in version 1.2.8, which includes proper sanitization to prevent the stored XSS."
