| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1614165#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-09 06:28:36 UTC  ``` The get_app_path function in desktop/unx/source/start.c in LibreOffice through 6.0.5 mishandles the realpath function in certain environments such as FreeBSD libc, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact if LibreOffice is automatically launched during web browsing with pathnames controlled by a remote web site.   Upstream Bug:  <https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118514>   Affected Code:  <https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/master/desktop/unx/source/start.c#L191>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1614165#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-08-09 06:29:21 UTC  ``` Related to [CVE-2018-11236](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-11236)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1614165#c2)  Stephan Bergmann    2018-08-09 08:25:59 UTC  ``` For one, that get_app_path is only called with argv[0] of LO's oosplash helper executable (installed at /usr/lib.../libreoffice/program/oosplash, called during the LO start-up sequence).  So an attack would need launch that executable with a suitably long argv[0].  I don't see how that could happen "if LibreOffice is automatically launched during web browsing with pathnames controlled by a remote web site." (<<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14939>>)  For another, I don't see how that get_app_path uses realpath(3) wrongly.  If there is an issue with the glibc implementation of realpath(3), as [CVE-2018-11236](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-11236) states, then it should be necessary and sufficient to fix the issue in glibc, and not in client code calling realpath(3), or am I missing something?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1614165#c3)  Adam Mariš    2018-08-10 14:47:53 UTC  ``` Neither do I see how can this cause buffer overflow on Linux. I also can't think of such attack scenario where a path name to oosplash can be controlled by remote web site.  For [CVE-2018-11236](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-11236), you're right, that's indeed a separate issue in realpath implementation that might get potentially triggered using this code, but that's out of scope of LO and this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1614165#c4)  Adam Mariš    2018-08-10 14:48:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of libreoffice as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=118514#c0)  Dhiraj    2018-07-03 07:59:27 UTC  ``` File: <https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/master/desktop/unx/source/start.c#L191>  This function does not protect against buffer overflows, and some implementations can overflow internally.   Ensure that the destination buffer is at least of size MAXPATHLEN, andto protect against implementation problems, the input argument should also be checked to ensure it is no larger than MAXPATHLEN.  According to the documentation of realpath() the output buffer needs to be at least of size PATH_MAX specifying output buffers large enough to handle the maximum-size possible result from path manipulation functions. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=118514#c1)  Xisco Faulí    2018-07-03 09:33:36 UTC  ``` Hello Dhiraj, Thank you for the analysis.
