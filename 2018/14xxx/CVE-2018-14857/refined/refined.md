Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14857:

**Root Cause:**

*   The OCS Inventory NG Web console, before version 2.5, allows unrestricted file uploads due to insufficient validation of file extensions. It does not restrict uploaded files to only `.html` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application fails to properly validate the file extension of uploaded files, allowing users to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including executable PHP files.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control of the server by executing malicious code via uploaded files. This can lead to data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ocsreports/index.php?function=notification` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request contains multipart form data with the malicious PHP file in the `template` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User Access:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user of the OCS Inventory NG web console to access the upload functionality.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OCS Inventory NG server.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit shows an example of uploading a `phpinfo.php` file containing the following code:
```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```
The file will be saved in `/usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/templates/` and is accessible via HTTP:
`http://192.168.5.135/ocsreports/templates/phpinfo.php`

**Patch Information:**
The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that only files with the `.html` extension could be uploaded. This was implemented in commit `cc572819e373f7ff81dec61591b6f465b43c5515`.
