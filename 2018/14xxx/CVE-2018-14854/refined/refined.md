Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-14854, CVE-2018-14855, and CVE-2018-14856:

**CVE-2018-14854**

*   **Root Cause:**  An unvalidated `flowid` parameter passed to the `dhd_bus_flow_ring_delete_response` function is used as an index into the `flow_ring_table` array, leading to an out-of-bounds access. The `flowid` value is attacker controlled through the WiFi SoC.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds array access. The function `dhd_bus_clean_flow_ring` dereferences a pointer from the out-of-bounds memory location. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Potential arbitrary code execution, denial of service (kernel crash).
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `flowid` value within the `tx_flowring_delete_response_t` structure, which is sent from the compromised WiFi peripheral, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs control over the WiFi SoC to manipulate the `flowid` parameter within the `tx_flowring_delete_response_t` structure.

**CVE-2018-14855**

*   **Root Cause:**  An unvalidated `flowid` parameter passed to the `dhd_bus_flow_ring_flush_response` function is used as an index into the `flow_ring_table` array.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds array access. Specifically the status byte of an arbitrary memory location is overwritten with zero.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary kernel memory byte zeroing and potential DoS through a kernel crash.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `flowid` value within the `tx_flowring_flush_response_t` structure sent from the compromised WiFi peripheral, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs control over the WiFi SoC to manipulate the `flowid` parameter within the `tx_flowring_flush_response_t` structure.

**CVE-2018-14856**

*   **Root Cause:**  An unvalidated `flowid` parameter passed to the `dhd_bus_flow_ring_create_response` function is used as an index into the `flow_ring_table` array, potentially causing an out-of-bounds access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds array access. The `lock` field of a struct located at this memory location is used as a parameter for `dhd_os_spin_lock` and `dhd_os_spin_unlock`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Potential arbitrary code execution by controlling the lock parameter or by zeroing an arbitrary byte, denial of service via kernel crash.
*    **Attack Vectors:** By manipulating the `flowid` value within the `tx_flowring_create_response_t` structure sent from the compromised WiFi peripheral, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs control over the WiFi SoC to manipulate the `flowid` parameter within the `tx_flowring_create_response_t` structure.

**Additional Key Points (Applicable to all three CVEs):**

*   **Vulnerability Location:** All three vulnerabilities are located within the `drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd4358/dhd_pcie.c` file. The file path and line numbers for each CVE are clearly stated in the document.
*   **Underlying Issue:** The core problem is the lack of validation of the `flowid` parameter before using it to access the `flow_ring_table`. The attacker can control the `flowid` through data provided by the WiFi peripheral.
*   **Affected Product:** The Samsung Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) with Firmware Version G920FXXU5EQH7 is the affected product.
*   **Defense Bypassed:** The `ASSERT` macro provides a warning message for a mismatch between the provided `flowid` and the flowid of the fetched struct, but doesn't prevent out-of-bounds access.
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** While these vulnerabilities exist within kernel code, they are made reachable by compromising the WiFi peripheral device, adding complexity to the attack.
*   **Kernel Traces:** The provided kernel traces show crashes and backtraces originating from the affected functions (`dhd_bus_flow_ring_create_response`, `dhd_bus_clean_flow_ring`, `dhd_bus_flow_ring_flush_response`, `dhd_bus_flow_ring_delete_response`).
*   **PERISCOPE Framework:** The document describes the use of a probing/fuzzing framework called PERISCOPE that was used to detect these bugs. This framework was designed to analyze the hardware-OS boundary and was used to create PERIFUZZ, a fuzzer that actively manipulates the data stream between the drivers and peripherals.
*   **Mitigation:** The report mentions that Samsung was notified of the vulnerabilities, and the underlying issue is that proper validation of the `flowid` parameter needs to be implemented before using it to access the `flow_ring_table`.

The provided information provides detailed insight into the root causes, vulnerabilities, attack vectors and potential impact of CVE-2018-14854, CVE-2018-14855, and CVE-2018-14856. It also details how a custom framework called PERISCOPE was used to discover these vulnerabilities.
