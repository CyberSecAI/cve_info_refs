Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-14328

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access controls on several pages of the "Online Trade" application. Specifically, direct requests to `/dashboard/addplan`, `/dashboard/paywithcard/charge`, `/dashboard/withdrawal`, or `/privacy&terms` expose sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application fails to restrict access to sensitive data, including database credentials (username, password, database name) and potentially the server's IP address.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** Direct access to the aforementioned URLs does not require authentication or proper session handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive database and system information.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposed database credentials could be used to compromise the entire application or other related systems, enabling data theft, manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests directly to vulnerable endpoints (e.g., `/dashboard/withdrawal`) without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable application to send HTTP requests.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials or any privileged access to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how an attacker can send a POST request to `/dashboard/withdrawal` to trigger an error that reveals the sensitive information. The exploit uses a long string value in the 'amount' parameter which causes a database error that is not handled properly, resulting in the disclosure of database credentials.
* The vulnerability is present in version 1 of "Online Trade - Online trading and cryptocurrency investment system" by Brynamics.

In summary, this vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain sensitive database information by sending direct requests to specific application endpoints.
