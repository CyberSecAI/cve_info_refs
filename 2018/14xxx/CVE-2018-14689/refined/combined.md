* 14 stored cross-site scripting instances
* Five reflected cross-site scripting instances

These vulnerabilities are described in the following sections.

### Affected Version

Version 6.1.1

### Subsonic 6.1.1 â Vulnerabilities

### Stored Cross-site Scripting

The Subsonic application is affected by 14 stored cross-site scripting (XSS) instances that are stored within different application features. These vulnerabilities enable the injection of a JavaScript payload inside a vulnerable page that will then be executed each time a user visits it. The vulnerabilities could be exploited with authenticated users and used to target administrators and steal their sessions.
