### Product Description

Subsonic is an open source web media server that enables the management of media resources such as music or videos. Its official website is [www.subsonic.org](http://www.subsonic.org). The version affected by the identified vulnerabilities is 6.1.1, released May 31, 2017.

### Vulnerabilities List

Two types of cross-site scripting were identified within the Subsonic application:

* 14 stored cross-site scripting instances
* Five reflected cross-site scripting instances

These vulnerabilities are described in the following sections.

### Affected Version

Version 6.1.1

### Subsonic 6.1.1 — Vulnerabilities

### Stored Cross-site Scripting

The Subsonic application is affected by 14 stored cross-site scripting (XSS) instances that are stored within different application features. These vulnerabilities enable the injection of a JavaScript payload inside a vulnerable page that will then be executed each time a user visits it. The vulnerabilities could be exploited with authenticated users and used to target administrators and steal their sessions.

### Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID: [CVE-2018-9282](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9282), [CVE-2018-14688](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14688), [CVE-2018-14689](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14689), [CVE-2018-14690](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14690), [CVE-2018-14691](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14691)**

**Access Vector: Remote**

**Security Risk: Critical**

**Vulnerability: CWE-79**

**CVSS Base Score: 9.8**

**CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

### Stored XSS on Podcast Subscription Form (CVE-2018-9282)
