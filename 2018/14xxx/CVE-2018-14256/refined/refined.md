  "CVE-2018-14256": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the getOCGs method. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "A type confusion vulnerability exists within the `getOCGs` method of Foxit Reader. The vulnerability can be triggered through JavaScript actions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page.",
      "Opening a malicious PDF file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious webpage or PDF document with JavaScript that triggers the type confusion. The target must then interact with this malicious content (user interaction required)."
