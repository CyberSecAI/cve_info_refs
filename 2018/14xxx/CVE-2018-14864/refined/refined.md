The provided content relates to CVE-2018-14864.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the origin of cached asset bundles in Odoo. The mechanism used to locate and serve cached asset bundles did not properly verify the source of the cached files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect access control:** The system lacked adequate checks on the origin of cached asset files, leading to the possibility of injection attacks.
- **Lack of input validation:** The mechanism for serving cached asset bundles did not sufficiently validate the source of the files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary web script injection:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript and CSS code by uploading a crafted attachment.
- **Session hijacking:** The injected code could be used to hijack user sessions of other users accessing the Odoo database through a web browser.
- **Privilege escalation:** By hijacking sessions, the attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network exploitable:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Crafted attachment:** The attack involves uploading a specially crafted attachment to poison the asset bundle cache.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user account:** An attacker needs a valid user account, including a simple portal user account, to upload a crafted attachment.
