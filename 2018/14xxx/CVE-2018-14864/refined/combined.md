## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32502#issue-430456495)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-2

Incorrect access control in asset bundles in Odoo Community 11.0 and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 11.0 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script via a crafted attachment.

**Affects**: Odoo 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Core

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14864](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14864)

## I. Background

Odoo's framework includes an automatic mechanism for minifying and

bundling web assets, in order to speed up page loads. This works by

grouping related assets in "bundles", and minifying them together

as a simple file that can be compressed and loaded faster.

As computing and compiling assets is an expensive operation, asset

bundles are cached and stored in the database and file store.

## II. Problem Description

The mechanism used to locate and serve cached assets bundles did not

sufficiently validate the origin of the cached files.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: Unprivileged user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.3

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)/E:P/RL:O/RC:C

An attacker with a non privileged user account (including a simple portal

user account) could upload a specially crafted attachment in order to

poison the asset bundle cache, and inject arbitrary assets

(JavaScript and CSS code). This could be used to hijack the sessions of

any user accessing the Odoo database via a web browser and allow the

attacker to gain elevated privileges.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

For portal users: administrators can modify the Access Control for

Attachments (`ir.attachment`) and prevent external users (also know as

"portal users") from creating or modifying attachments. External users

do not normally need this permission except for posting messages with

attachments in the portal, which is an acceptable trade-off.

For internal users: administrators could further modify Access Control to

prevent everyone from creating/modifying Attachments (`ir.attachment`).

This will entirely prevent exploiting this vulnerability, but comes with

a great functional impact. Many business processes will be disrupted, so

this should only be used as a temporary solution, until the patch can

be applied.

For Odoo Online: all servers have been patched as soon as the correction

was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [e5984fb](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/e5984fbfc3141d83184c13b627a918f4d9913d0c)
* 10.0: [19ac9fb](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/19ac9fba0d4be4e30d6103e6ebd49b466adb74b5)
* 11.0: [bfffe39](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/bfffe39f1376a56226572295b945a2cc73ba50ce)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.
