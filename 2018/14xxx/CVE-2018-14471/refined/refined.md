The content relates to CVE-2018-14471.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing check for a null pointer before dereferencing `ctrl->block_headers` in the `dwg_obj_block_control_get_block_headers` function within `dwg_api.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference. The code assumes that `ctrl->block_headers` is always a valid pointer, but it can be null, leading to a crash when the code attempts to access memory at the null address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This can lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious DWG file that, when parsed, results in `ctrl->block_headers` being null. This triggers the null pointer dereference in the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted DWG file to the vulnerable application (`dwg2svg2` in this case).
