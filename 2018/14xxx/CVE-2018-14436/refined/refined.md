Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14436:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a memory leak vulnerability in the `coders/miff.c` file of ImageMagick, specifically in the handling of colormaps. Memory is allocated for the colormap, but is not freed in the exception branch when an error is encountered during processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, the allocated memory for the colormap is not freed when the code encounters an unsupported `quantum_info->depth` value within a switch statement, leading to a potential memory leak if this error path is triggered multiple times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly triggering this memory leak by processing specially crafted MIFF (Magick Image File Format) images with a non-supported depth could lead to excessive memory consumption, ultimately causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Image:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious MIFF image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the vulnerable code path in `coders/miff.c`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Crafted MIFF Image:** An attacker would need the ability to provide a specially crafted image to a system or application that uses ImageMagick to process MIFF images. This could be done via a web application that accepts user-submitted images, or by directly manipulating files on a system that uses ImageMagick.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the ImageMagick code to understand that a MIFF image with unsupported bit depth would trigger this issue.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided GitHub issue link ([https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1191](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1191)) offers the specific code location and a clear description of the vulnerability.
* The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3785-1) mentions this CVE as part of a larger set of vulnerabilities fixed in ImageMagick.
* The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring the allocated colormap memory is freed in all code paths, including the error/exception paths.
