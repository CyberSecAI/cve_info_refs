    "related": true,
    "summary": "BlogEngine 3.3 is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE) via the metaweblog.axd endpoint.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application processes XML data without properly sanitizing or disabling external entity references, leading to the vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server, and possibly cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker sends a crafted XML payload to the `metaweblog.axd` endpoint using a POST request, specifically targeting the `BodyXML` parameter."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication. An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted XML request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
       "additional_information": "The provided exploit code `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><!DOCTYPE ns [<!ELEMENT ns ANY><!ENTITY lfi SYSTEM \"file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts\">]><ns>&lfi;</ns>` demonstrates how an attacker can use an external entity to read the content of the hosts file from a Windows server."
