{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for previous vulnerabilities related to symlink handling. Specifically, the GlusterFS server doesn't properly validate symlinks, allowing a malicious user to direct file operations to arbitrary locations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerabilities.",
      "Improper validation of symlinks.",
      "Path traversal vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote authenticated attacker can leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code, create arbitrary files, or cause a denial of service on GlusterFS server nodes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploitation via symlinks pointing to relative paths."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to a GlusterFS server."
