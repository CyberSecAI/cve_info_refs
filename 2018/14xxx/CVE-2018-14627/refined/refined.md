Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `wildfly-iiop-openjdk` component in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) where the IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) implementation does not enforce strict transport confidentiality. Specifically, when configured to require SSL/TLS, the implementation still allows clients to establish plaintext (unencrypted) connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Transport Layer Enforcement:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce confidentiality requirements at the transport layer when using IIOP. The system should reject unencrypted connections when configured for SSL/TLS, but this is not happening.
*   **Missing Configuration Honouring:** The IIOP subsystem is not honoring the `confidentiality="required"` setting in its configuration, allowing plaintext connections.
*  **Insecure Communication:** The vulnerability exists because the IIOP component fails to adhere to configured security requirements, enabling insecure (plaintext) communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information transmitted over the unencrypted IIOP connection. This could include authentication credentials, application data, or other sensitive communications.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** The ability to establish plaintext connections makes the system susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept and eavesdrop on communications between the client and server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating an IIOP connection to a vulnerable JBoss EAP server using a client that connects via a plaintext, unencrypted channel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable JBoss EAP server.
*   **IIOP Client:** The attacker needs an IIOP client capable of initiating a plaintext connection.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges to exploit the vulnerability, as they would generally try to establish the connection to access exposed functionality or services.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform versions before 7.1.5 on RHEL 6 and 7, and potentially other products that incorporate vulnerable versions of Wildfly libraries.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`
*   **NetApp products:** Multiple NetApp products incorporate Wildfly libraries and are vulnerable if using versions before 14.0.0.
*   **Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO):** It appears this issue also affects RH-SSO, as per the errata RHSA-2018:3595, which includes a fix for this CVE. This indicates the vulnerability is present in Keycloak, which is the upstream project for RH-SSO.
*   **NetApp Mitigation:** NetApp identifies that none of their products are affected.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a flaw in the IIOP implementation of Wildfly which does not enforce the configured transport confidentiality, leading to potential information disclosure. An attacker can exploit this by establishing plaintext connections to a vulnerable server.
