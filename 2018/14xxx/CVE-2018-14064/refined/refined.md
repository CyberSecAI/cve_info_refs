Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) type, found in the `uc-http` service (version 1.0.0) of the VelotiSmart WiFi B-380 camera.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The `uc-http` service does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) in a URL to access files and directories outside the intended web server root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the device, including:
    - Configuration files
    - Wireless network scan results
    - Sensitive directories
    - User credentials (e.g. `/etc/passwd` with root user and a weak password `xmhdipc`)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP requests to the device's web server on port 80.
- **Malicious URL:** Attackers include directory traversal sequences in the URL, like `http://domain:80/../../etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device on the local network or have access to the device through another means such as VPN.
- **Basic Understanding:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences.
