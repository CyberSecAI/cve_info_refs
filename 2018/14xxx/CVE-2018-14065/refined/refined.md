Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-14065:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of XML entities, specifically an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core issue is the presence of an XML External Entity injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to include external entities within the XML data processed by the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read local files from the server or other internal systems reachable by the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By including large external files or recursively defined entities, an attacker could cause the server to consume excessive resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XML:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious XML document that contains an external entity definition. This malicious XML would then be processed by the vulnerable application.
- **File Upload/Processing:** The most likely attack vector involves an attacker providing a crafted XML file to the application, which then parses it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to submit XML:** The attacker needs to be in a position to provide or upload XML files that will be processed by the vulnerable application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker might need to have network access to the server for fetching external resources if they use network-based external entities.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by @Tom4t0 and was fixed in the 0.2.9 release of PHPOffice/Common.
- The fix involved disabling the parsing of XML entities.
- The vulnerability was originally discovered in PHPOffice/PHPWord and was fixed in the common library.
