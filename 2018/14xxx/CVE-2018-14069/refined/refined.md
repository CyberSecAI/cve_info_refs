Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `SRCMS` application. Specifically, the application does not implement proper validation of requests to prevent malicious actions initiated from another origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability exists in the `admin.php?m=Admin&c=manager&a=add` endpoint (add administrator)
- CSRF vulnerability exists in the `admin.php?m=Admin&c=member&a=add` endpoint (add user)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can add a new administrator account.
- An attacker can add a new user account.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the application by taking control of administrator accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (e.g., add_admin.html or add_user.html).
- The victim (an authenticated administrator) is tricked into opening the malicious page while they are logged into the application.
- The malicious HTML form submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint on the application's domain using the administrator's session/cookie
- The server receives this request and, due to the lack of CSRF protection, executes the request, adding either a new administrator or a new user account as specified in the form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious webpage they control
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable POST requests, including the parameters (usernames, passwords, etc.).
- No additional position in the network is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided HTML snippets showcase the attack by creating forms that submit POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **`add_admin.html`:** This form targets the administrator creation endpoint. It sets predefined values for username, email, and password, effectively creating a new admin user if submitted by a logged-in administrator
*   **`add_user.html`:** This form targets the user creation endpoint, setting predefined values including user level and status in addition to the standard username, email and password.
