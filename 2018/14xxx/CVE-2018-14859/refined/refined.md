The provided content is related to CVE-2018-14859.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A secret field used to construct the secure password reset link was not properly protected against access by internal users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect access control in the password reset component.
- Internal users could access the secret token used in the password reset process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious internal user ("Employee" access required) could reset the password of other users, including administrators.
- The attacker could use the secret field to change the password of other users before they react to the reset email.
- The attacker could then abuse the compromised credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network exploitable.
- Requires a malicious internal user with "Employee" access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated internal user with "Employee" level access.
- The attacker must be able to trigger a password reset for a target user.
- The attacker must be able to access and use the secret token associated with the reset request.
