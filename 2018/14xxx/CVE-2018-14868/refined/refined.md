Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in the `auth_crypt` module of Odoo. This module is responsible for password encryption, using salted cryptographic hashes derived via PBKDF2 with SHA-512.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks, allowing authenticated users to modify other user's passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker, including portal users, can change any user's password without knowing the existing one by crafting a specific RPC request. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Data breaches and manipulation.
    - Complete compromise of the Odoo system if administrative accounts are targeted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network exploitation: Attackers can remotely exploit this vulnerability.
- Malicious RPC requests: The attack is performed by crafting specific RPC calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Odoo system. This includes regular users and portal users with any level of access.
- The attacker requires network access to the Odoo system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise editions version 9.0. Versions 10.0 and later are not impacted.
- The vulnerability is present in the `auth_crypt` module.
- A CVSS v3 score of 8.1 (High) is assigned to this CVE, with the vector string: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`.
- There was no known workaround except restricting network access or uninstalling the `auth_crypt` module, but uninstalling would deny access to all users with hashed passwords.
- Patches are available for the affected versions, and users are advised to update to the latest revision or apply the provided patches.
- The specific commits fixing the vulnerability in version 9.0 is `e9624a8`.
