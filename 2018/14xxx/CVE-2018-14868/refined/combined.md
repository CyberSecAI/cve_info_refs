## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32507#issue-430456652)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-7

Incorrect access control in the Password Encryption module in Odoo Community 9.0 and Odoo Enterprise 9.0 allows authenticated users to change the password of other users without knowing their current password via a crafted RPC call.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: auth\_crypt module

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14868](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14868)

## I. Background

As of Odoo 8.0, when local passwords are used, the passwords are stored

by default as salted cryptographic hashes (derived via PBKDF2 using

SHA-512 hashing). This is provided by the "Password Encryption" module

(auth\_crypt), which is automatically installed.

## II. Problem Description

Improper access control in the auth\_crypt module allows authenticated

users to change user passwords without any control.

## III. Impact

Access Vector: Network exploitable

Access Complexity: Low

**Authentication**: User account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 8.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

By crafting a malicious RPC request, remote authenticated attackers

(including portal users) could force a chosen password on any user, without

knowing their current password.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, other than restricting remote access to the system

to trustworthy network addresses only. Uninstalling the "Password Encryption"

module (auth\_crypt) would work too, with the side-effect of denying access to all

users currently authenticated with hashed passwords.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [e9624a8](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/e9624a846048188e5282f65926f98dc297467245)
* 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 9.0.

Versions 10.0 and later are not impacted by this vulnerability.

However, we should also allow to configure the `product.product`'s custom PTAVs (which can be `always` or `dynamic`). Moreover, we always allowed to configure `no_variant` PTALs, even if they weren't configurable (i.e. PTALs with a single, non-custom, non-multicheckbox PTAV). However, such PTAVs should be preselected and non-configurable in the combo configurator. closes odoo/odoo#194968 Signed-off-by: Louis Tinel (loti) <loti@odoo.com>")

This happens because `handleObserverRecords` calls `updateHints`, which relies on `getSelectionData`. However, `this.activeSelection` retains the outdated selection due to conditions like `documentSelectionIsInEditable` and `!this.activeSelection.anchorNode.isConnected` being `false`. As a result, `this.activeSelection` reflects `a[b]` while the DOM selection has already updated to `a[]`, leading to invalid offsets. **Solution**: Call `this.dependencies.selection.focusEditable();` during `onSelect` to ensure the selection is updated to reflect the editor state rather than the mention state. **Steps to Reproduce**: 1. Open the chatter. 2. Add some text. 3. Select a portion of the text. 4. Type `@`. 5. Select an item (person) from the mention list. 6. Observe a traceback error. opw-4498165 closes odoo/odoo#194982 X-original-commit: 618e7af08e5989d3fc58ba54a19c7ca74a42ef04 Signed-off-by: David Monjoie (dmo) <dmo@odoo.com>")

* #### [[FIX] core: module state may be incorrect after successful installation](/odoo/odoo/commit/306671c2bd2474c7f19bea64fd6ad96b4a020c56 "[FIX] core: module state may be incorrect after successful installation Given the following module hierarchy: <pre> ... \_ test_install_base \_ test_install_auto \_ test_install_fail </pre> Where: * The auto-installed module has (for sake of example) some a model override of `ResCurrency` that defines a new method for the class. This module also has some data that defines an `IrCron` record, which executes the method added by the `ResCurrency` override within its own model files. * The data error module has a view extension which has some bad syntax that will trigger a failure in `load_data()`. Upon running an odoo instance with `-i test_install_fail`, the registry loading will proceed until failing at this module. As expected, the module test_install_auto has been installed just before the failing one. The CRON data loaded from test_install_auto is in the database. However, the module itself is not marked as 'installed', and the cron will fail to execute, since the module test_install_auto is not loaded by the registry. The problem occurs because a package's data/schema changes are committed prior to actually marking the module record as 'installed'. Moreover, the module's state change is not committed right away, which causes that change to be part of the next module's loading transaction. When the module test_install_fail fails to install, the current transaction is rolled back, and the module's state is reset to 'uninstalled'. Because the state change of module test_install_auto is part of the rolled back transaction, that module remains in state 'to install', and is eventually also reset to 'uninstalled'. Because of this, we are left with a CRON record from test_install_auto, but the latter is not loaded by the registry. This causes the CRON to fail to execute, because of a missing method used by the CRON. closes odoo/odoo#194625 X-original-commit: 0e72fca3617edf1f1eb7ae012bcdccb73c460ff6 Signed-off-by: Raphael Collet <rco@odoo.com> Signed-off-by: Vincent Ethan <etvi@odoo.com>")

Cause: - The is_timeoff_task field is loaded for users without Timesheet access, causing an AccessError due to its dependency on account.analytic.line. - In this commit, we are counting time-off tasks from the timesheet instead of the time-off type. The time-off type model was accessible to all users, so this issue didn’t happen before. See this commit: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4f887a878b1ef23b0fd8eb7b440fd2aa04c9d36c#diff-4f3297774d04158af2337bf66b96044ae115007ac202fd96fa46760dfbc470e2L14 for details. Solution: - Restrict the field's loading and add the hr_timesheet.group_hr_timesheet_user group in the field definition to ensure it is only computed for authorized users. task-4417760 closes odoo/odoo#194964 X-original-commit: a164d8ef9d5169de4a0ad959cc09ce08f1af6ab0 Signed-off-by: Panagiotis Kyriakou (paky) <paky@odoo.com> Signed-off-by: Mahendiali Jafarali Vijapura (mjvi) <mjvi@odoo.com>")

* #### [[FIX] account: Allow skipping bank account creation on reconciliation](/odoo/odoo/commit/164a3543a3d2b6a1cd2e9e3d6393ebcbc97e79d8 "[FIX] account: Allow skipping bank account creation on reconciliation This commit introduces system parameter to skip the creation of bank account in the reconciliation of bank statements. The issue it can solve happens when 2 different commercial entities use the same paying partner (ie a partner that is not a subcontact) to pay their invoices. When an invoice is paid by the paying partner, Odoo will store the account number that was used for the transfer on account.bank.statement.line. When this statement line is reconciled with an invoice, if the bank account was not stored on the partner previously, a res.partner.bank will be created automatically. When another payment is coming from the same bank account, Odoo will then select the partner linked to the bank account that it did store previously, even if the payment was for an invoice linked to another partner, and it will not propose the proper invoice in the reconciliation widget, even if it uses an exact match on the payment reference number. Having a parameter allowing to skip creation of the bank account in Odoo will allow the reconciliation to be based striclty on the reference number. closes odoo/odoo#194963 X-original-commit: 62119f2989b9508f968bedb7570c85268a8ae568 Signed-off-by: Laurent Smet (las) <las@odoo.com>")

Explanation (1) seems obsolete since we protect all inverted fields from being invalidated or marked for recomputation. It's probably because we didn't protect no-store fields before, but we do it since https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/35659/files#diff-7144f88ea32f36feb17ce1b8dda7dee1631f5ada34075414587df3948c6b3d1bR5433 Thus we can remove this complexity and avoid useless unbatched calls of inverse methods.

We therefore inverse the field record by record.\" closes odoo/odoo#193349 Signed-off-by: Raphael Collet <rco@odoo.com>")

Previously outlook had a wrapper div around divRplyFwdMsg which would set data-o-mail-quote-container on it, and propagate to children.
