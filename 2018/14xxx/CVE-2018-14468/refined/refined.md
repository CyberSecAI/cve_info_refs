{
  "CVE-2018-14468": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-14468",
      "Description": "The FRF.16 parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-fr.c:mfr_print()."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `mfr_print()` function within `print-fr.c`, where a buffer over-read occurs when parsing FRF.16 frames. Specifically, the code does not properly check the length of the Magic Number information element before attempting to read its 4-byte value.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer over-read"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could trigger a denial of service by sending a specially crafted FRF.16 packet that causes `tcpdump` to read beyond buffer boundaries, leading to a crash.",
      "Attack vector": "Network; sending a crafted FRF.16 packet to a system capturing traffic with tcpdump.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system where tcpdump is capturing the traffic. No authentication is required, and the attack complexity is low since no specific network configuration is needed, other than tcpdump capturing data.",
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability is in the FRF.16 parser. The issue arises when processing the Magic Number Information Element. The code reads 4 bytes of data but does not verify that the received information element has a length of 4 bytes first."
