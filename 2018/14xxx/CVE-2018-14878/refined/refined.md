Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A critical vulnerability existed in dotPeek and ReSharper related to how assembly resources were handled when viewed in the Assembly Explorer window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- The vulnerability is related to viewing assembly resources within the Assembly Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute their own code within the context of the user running dotPeek or ReSharper.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves viewing assembly resources in the Assembly Explorer window within dotPeek or ReSharper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to provide a malicious assembly that, when its resources are viewed in the Assembly Explorer, triggers the vulnerability. The user of dotPeek or ReSharper would need to open the malicious assembly in the vulnerable application.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it specifies the vulnerable components (dotPeek and ReSharper), the specific window involved (Assembly Explorer), and the type of code execution possible.
