Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14930:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Polaris Intellect Core Banking Software version 9.7.1 lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application doesn't properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform malicious actions on behalf of a valid user without their knowledge or consent. This could include modifying data, initiating transactions, or any action the user is authorized to perform.
- The provided example shows the ability to create new entries, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification within the system, and indicates impact includes code execution and information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage containing a forged request.
- The attacker uses phishing or social engineering techniques to trick a logged-in user into clicking the malicious link or visiting the malicious webpage.
- If the user is authenticated with the vulnerable application, the forged request is executed as though it originated from the user, without the user's explicit knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need direct access to the application or the target user's credentials.
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious URL or webpage to the targeted user.
- The targeted user must be logged into the vulnerable application for the attack to succeed.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how a CSRF attack can add a new "SUPP" record in the system, showcasing the ability to manipulate data via this vulnerability.
- The blog post also mentions a disclosure timeline with vendor, mitre and public disclosure dates.
