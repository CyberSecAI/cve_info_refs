      "description": "The provided content details multiple instances of CVE-2018-14041 being discussed and fixed within various software products. The core vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in the data-target attribute of the scrollspy feature in Bootstrap, a popular web framework.",
      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the 'data-target' attribute of the scrollspy plugin in Bootstrap.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could inject malicious script code which would execute in the victim's browser within the security context of the vulnerable website. This can lead to stealing the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials or other sensitive information, potentially resulting in account hijacking.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered through the use of a crafted HTML element containing a malicious script within the 'data-target' attribute of a scrollspy component.",
        "The crafted code is executed when the scrollspy component is activated, potentially through normal user interaction like scrolling."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML into a webpage that uses the vulnerable version of Bootstrap.",
        "No special privileges or specific network position is needed. An attacker only needs to be able to introduce a specially crafted HTML element to a website using Bootstrap."
      ],
      "additional_details": [
        "Multiple mentions confirm that this vulnerability affects Bootstrap versions prior to 4.1.2 and was also present in versions before 3.4.0. The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.1.2 of Bootstrap.",
        "Several linked GitHub issues and pull requests provide specific code examples of the XSS payload, along with patch details.",
        "The bug has been addressed in multiple Red Hat products including Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, and Red Hat Ceph Storage, each through respective security advisories (RHSA-2019:1456, RHSA-2023:0553, RHSA-2023:0552, RHSA-2023:0554, RHSA-2023:0556, and RHSA-2023:5693).",
         "The vulnerability has also been identified within other software that uses affected versions of bootstrap (e.g.  dotCMS, typo3)."
