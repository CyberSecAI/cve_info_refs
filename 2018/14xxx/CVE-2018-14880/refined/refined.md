{
  "CVE-2018-14880": {
    "Description": "The OSPFv3 parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-ospf6.c:ospf6_print_lshdr().",
    "Root cause": "A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the OSPFv3 parser within the `ospf6_print_lshdr` function in `print-ospf6.c`. This occurs due to improper bounds checking when parsing and printing the OSPFv3 Link State Advertisement (LSA) header.",
     "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted OSPFv3 packets that, when processed by `tcpdump`, cause a buffer over-read, leading to a denial of service through application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network traffic"
     ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that includes specially crafted OSPFv3 packets."
