Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-14381:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an open redirect flaw in the `/user/login` endpoint of Pagekit. Specifically, the `redirect` parameter within the login URL is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary external URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect: The application does not validate or sanitize the `redirect` parameter in the login URL, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: An attacker can craft malicious URLs to redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious sites, potentially stealing credentials or performing other malicious actions.
- Data exfiltration: Redirecting to attacker controlled server that logs user-agent, referer, or other data sent by the vulnerable page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious destination in the `redirect` parameter and sends it to a user or embeds it in a link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated
- The attacker needs to convince a user to click the malicious URL.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by zhihua.yao from DBAPPSecurity
- It was patched in version 1.0.14 of Pagekit, which contains the fix for the open redirect vulnerability.
