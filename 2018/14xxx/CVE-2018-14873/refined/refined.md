The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the rincewind CMS application before 2011-2-20.

- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient input sanitization/validation. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "Namn" (Name) field, before displaying it on the page.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly encode user input when displaying it.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Namn" field. When a user views the page displaying this unsanitized data, the malicious script will be executed within their browser session, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: The attacker modifies the "Namn" field with a crafted input containing JavaScript code, which gets stored in the database. The vulnerable page renders the unsanitized data.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker must be able to access and modify the user profile within the rincewind CMS application, specifically the "Namn" field. This typically requires a valid user account.
