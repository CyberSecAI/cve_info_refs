Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2018-14326:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for integer overflows when resizing an `MP4Array` in the `mp4array.h` file during the parsing of an MP4 file. Specifically, it occurs in the `Resize()` method of the `MP4Array` template class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the new size for the array by multiplying `newSize` by `sizeof(type)`.  If `newSize` is large enough, the result of this multiplication can overflow the maximum value of a 32-bit integer, leading to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation.
- **Heap Corruption:** When the allocation size is overflowed, the subsequent memory allocation using MP4Realloc might succeed (or fail on 32 bit systems) with the insufficient memory, leading to heap corruption when the code writes outside of the allocated region. On 32 bit systems the allocation will fail, but the destructor will be invoked on the corrupt object, leading to invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted MP4 file with a large value in the 'ftyp' atom can trigger the integer overflow, leading to a crash of the application or other unpredictable behavior, effectively causing a denial-of-service.
- **Memory Corruption:** Due to the smaller than expected memory allocation, out of bound writes can lead to memory corruption which could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious MP4 file that, when parsed by a vulnerable application using the `libmp4v2` library, triggers the integer overflow during the `MP4Array` resize operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious MP4 file to a system using a vulnerable version of the `libmp4v2` library.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `Resize()` method within the `mp4array.h` file.
- The issue was identified during processing of the 'ftyp' atom, where the `compatibleBrands` array is resized.
- The fix includes adding a check to see if multiplication `newSize * sizeof(type)` is overflowing the maximum size for the type.

**Affected Code:**
```c++
template <class type>
class MP4Array {
    void Resize(MP4ArrayIndex newSize) {
      m_numElements = newSize;
      m_maxNumElements = newSize;
      m_elements = (type*)MP4Realloc(m_elements, m_maxNumElements * sizeof(type));
    }
}
```
