  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Kirby CMS application does not implement proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions like deleting or adding web pages, which could lead to data loss, privilege escalation, or other unauthorized modifications.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to the vulnerable Kirby CMS application. When a logged-in user opens this page in their browser, the form is automatically submitted, triggering the action without the user's explicit consent.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page and trick a logged-in user into visiting it."
  },
  "exploit": {
    "description": "The provided exploit code shows a crafted HTML page with a form that, when submitted, sends a request to delete a specific page in the Kirby CMS application. The form includes a hidden input field for the redirect path, and a javascript to automatically submit the form. This demonstrates how an attacker can perform actions by tricking an authenticated user.",
