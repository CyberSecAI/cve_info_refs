        "vulnerability_details": {
          "root_cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `exportData` XFA function, which can lead to writing arbitrary files into attacker-controlled locations.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "Improper input validation",
            "Arbitrary file write"

          "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
          "attack_vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",

         "vulnerability_details": {
          "root_cause": "The application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users.",
