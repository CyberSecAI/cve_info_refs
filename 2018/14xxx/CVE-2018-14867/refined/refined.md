Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-14867:

**Root Cause:**
- A programming error in the security check of the message post feature in Odoo's portal messaging system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the security check that verifies if a user is authorized to post messages on a particular document. This check can be easily bypassed.
- **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability can also be exploited to leak the values of certain fields on arbitrary documents by using a trial-and-error approach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Message Posting:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can post messages on any document with a message history, as if they were the customer associated with that document.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can guess the values of specific fields on documents by sending multiple crafted requests, though this is limited by the fact that it's time-consuming and will result in messages being posted on the targeted document.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is accessible over a network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No user account is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any specific credentials.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Odoo instance.

**Affected Versions:**
- Odoo Community 9.0 and 10.0
- Odoo Enterprise 9.0 and 10.0

**Mitigation:**
- Apply the patches provided by Odoo.
