Consequently, the sequence of actions was interrupted, causing the tour to break midway. After this commit: =================== - The issue has been resolved by updating the tour to use the correct and unique class selector.

Cause: - The is_timeoff_task field is loaded for users without Timesheet access, causing an AccessError due to its dependency on account.analytic.line. - In this commit, we are counting time-off tasks from the timesheet instead of the time-off type. The time-off type model was accessible to all users, so this issue didn’t happen before.

The issue it can solve happens when 2 different commercial entities use the same paying partner (ie a partner that is not a subcontact) to pay their invoices. When an invoice is paid by the paying partner, Odoo will store the account number that was used for the transfer on account.bank.statement.line. When this statement line is reconciled with an invoice, if the bank account was not stored on the partner previously, a res.partner.bank will be created automatically. When another payment is coming from the same bank account, Odoo will then select the partner linked to the bank account that it did store previously, even if the payment was for an invoice linked to another partner, and it will not propose the proper invoice in the reconciliation widget, even if it uses an exact match on the payment reference number. Having a parameter allowing to skip creation of the bank account in Odoo will allow the reconciliation to be based striclty on the reference number. closes odoo/odoo#194963 X-original-commit: 62119f2989b9508f968bedb7570c85268a8ae568 Signed-off-by: Laurent Smet (las) <las@odoo.com>")

So that they may be hidden in the front-end. The detection of the signature using the \"-- <br>\" sets the parent of the element where is is detected to be a \"quote container\". However a quote container will set all of its children to be quotes too. If the signature is in the main div of the email, as is the case in most templates this means the whole content is marked as being inside a \"quote container\". Because the processing of the elements is done in order of their appearance in the document, this does not lead to the entire document becoming a quote the first time html_normalize is called. As the signature is typically the last element, the \"container\" attribute is only set after the whole body was already processed. However if the body is normalized again, the main div is now marked as a \"quote container\" and the whole body becomes a quote. - `<div><p>body</p><div>--<br>John</div></div>` - `<div quote-container><p>body</p><div quote>--<br quote>John</div></div>` - `<div quote-container><p quote>body</p><div quote>--<br quote>John</div></div>` We now check whether a quoted sibling exists in the container before marking a node as \"quote\". All nodes following the original quote and their children will be quoted as before, all nodes before will not be quoted anymore. triggered by 24731938f75358fd3c72b91465b72ab80d62d208 task-4381505 X-original-commit: a06fcc94dfa7702761d55f30d5f98e77ea3c5a69 Part-of: odoo/odoo#194884 Signed-off-by: Thibault Delavallee (tde) <tde@openerp.com> Signed-off-by: Renaud Thiry (reth) <reth@odoo.com>")

Previously outlook had a wrapper div around divRplyFwdMsg which would set data-o-mail-quote-container on it, and propagate to children. However it seems that outer div was either removed or is not always present, a heuristic is thus needed. task-4381505 X-original-commit: 1b098fa17f953b24374c10ceb9f1753bba7dff7c Part-of: odoo/odoo#194884 Signed-off-by: Thibault Delavallee (tde) <tde@openerp.com> Signed-off-by: Renaud Thiry (reth) <reth@odoo.com>")

## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32503#issue-430456556)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-3

Incorrect access control in the portal messaging system in Odoo Community 9.0 and 10.0 and Odoo Enterprise 9.0 and 10.0 allows remote attackers to post messages on behalf of customers, and to guess document attribute values, via crafted parameters.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0, 10.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: website\_mail

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz), Naglis Jonaitis, Andrew Grasso

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14867](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14867)

## I. Background

Odoo's messaging engine allows visitors on the website to post messages on

existing documents. That mechanism is used to chat with unauthenticated users or

to allow portal users to comment on their documents such as orders or tickets.

This feature is limited by a security check that only allow users to post on

documents when they have received a direct secure link to the document.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error in the security check of the message post feature makes it

easy to circumvent. It can also turn it into a vector for leaking limited

information about arbitrary documents.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: No user account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.5

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

A remote unauthenticated attacker could craft a request in order to post messages

on any document of the database which includes a message history,

as if they had been posted by the customer linked to the document.

This attack also allows the attacker to guess, by trial and error, the value of

a limited number of fields on such document. This is mitigated by the fact that

it is very time consuming and will cause messages to be posted on the document.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

No workaround is available, applying the patch is strongly recommended.

Uninstalling the "website\_mail" module can prevent exploiting this

vulnerability, at the expense of making some parts of the Odoo deployment

stop working (depending on the version and other modules installed).

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [6033439](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/6033439c67d696f5accb7e17ac42de6f9c0bd0b3)
* 10.0: [e00370e](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/e00370e194ffa0c527bb4669401949cc6a15f55f)
* 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 10.0 and 9.0.

The version 11.0 is not impacted by this vulnerability.
