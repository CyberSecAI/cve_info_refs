{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Thompson Reuters UltraTax CS software transmits sensitive customer data in cleartext over SMBv2 and stores it unencrypted on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext transmission of sensitive data over SMBv2.",
      "Unencrypted storage of sensitive data on the server."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can intercept sensitive information by sniffing the network or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. The exposed data includes Client ID, full name, SSN, addresses, phone numbers, tax preparer information, federal/state taxes, bank names, and bank account numbers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network sniffing on the same collision domain (e.g., same wireless network).",
      "ARP poisoning on the same broadcast domain (e.g., switched network).",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need to be on the same local network as the client/server or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "additional_details": "The software does not require a password upon setup, and access controls can be bypassed. The vulnerability was validated on UltraTax CS 2017, but older versions may be vulnerable as well."
