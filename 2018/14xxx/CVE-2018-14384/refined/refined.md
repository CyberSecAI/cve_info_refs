Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the SEO Panel application, specifically when handling the "name" parameter within the Website Manager module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores user-supplied input (malicious JavaScript) without sanitizing it, leading to the execution of this code within other users' browsers when they access the affected page.
- Improper Input Handling: The application fails to validate and sanitize the input received through the "name" parameter in the Website Manager.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal users' session cookies through XSS, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can steal users' login credentials by injecting malicious JavaScript that captures keystrokes.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially altering application data or causing harm.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers might manipulate data visible to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker injects the malicious script through a web request.
- **Website Manager Module:** The specific attack vector is via the "name" parameter in the Website Manager, where adding or editing a website allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker likely needs to have some level of access to modify the website information (i.e., admin privileges).
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the "name" parameter in the "websites.php" page can be manipulated to inject malicious scripts.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The content includes the affected URL (`http://<target>//websites.php`) and parameter (`name`).
- Specific steps for injection are outlined, involving the Website Manager module.
- Proof-of-concept (POC) screenshots demonstrate the injection, storage, and execution of the XSS payload.
- The advisory mentions that the issue is resolved in version v3.14.0.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-14384.
