| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-19 13:59:48 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-19 13:59:54 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1603235,1603236  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:17:27 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-02 08:08:11 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-eace0e3fce has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-eace0e3fce>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-02 08:08:25 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-cba94a2e76 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-cba94a2e76>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-02 08:08:39 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-07598ce28e has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-07598ce28e>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1603236#c6)  Fedora Update System    2019-11-04 02:09:27 UTC  ``` libmp4v2-2.1.0-0.18.trunkREV507.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

* Added public API functions `MP4ReadCallbacks`, `MP4CreateCallbacks[Ex]` and `MP4ModifyCallbacks[Ex]` to allow working with custom I/O routines and memory buffers.
* Added public API function `MP4FreeH264SeqPictHeaders` to free memory allocated by `MP4GetTrackH264SeqPictHeaders`.

#### 2. General improvements

* I/O system

  + Switched to ANSI C file I/O on Windows for improved performance with large files.
  + Handle extended paths (prefixed with `\\?\` or `\\?\UNC\`) on Windows.
* MP4Modify behavior

  + Attempt to truncate files if when modify reduces their size instead of filling space with a `free` atom.
  + Attempt to keep `moov` atom at the start of the file if it does not increase in size.
  + Do not leave empty `mdat` atoms behind after modify.

#### 3. Tools improvements

* Write total length and additonal metadata to `.chapters.txt` files when exporting chapters with `mp4chaps`.
* Added options for modifying sort tags (`sortartist`, `sortname` etc.) to `mp4tags`.

#### 4. Documentation improvements

* Converted old API documentation man pages to Doxygen comments in the public header files.

#### 5. Build system improvements

* Updated the Autotools build system

  + Fixed building as a shared library on Windows.
  + Added support for `pkg-config`.
* Added support for building with CMake.
* Upgraded Visual Studio solution and projects for Visual Studio 2022.
* Added Xcode project files.

#### 6. Bug fixes

* Fixed issues handling files with sample times exceeding 2^32.
* Fixed compile errors and warnings with newer versions of GCC/Clang.

#### 7. Vulnerability fixes

Subject: Type confusion in MP4v2 2.0.0

Hi,

A type confusion bug is found in MP4v2 2.0.0, a legacy library dealing
with MP4 media file.

========= ilst box =========

According to ref[2], MP4 file could contain an `ilst` box, which
stands for item list. Tags such as album, author, etc., are stored
here. A typical `ilst` box looks like this:

[ilst box] --> [nam box(full name)] -> [data box]
         |---> [cmt box(comment)] -> [data box]
         |---> [day box(created time)] -> [data box]
         ...

MP4v2 would use `MP4ItemAtom` for nam/cmt/... box, and `MP4DataAtom`
for data box:

 772 MP4Atom*
 773 MP4Atom::factory( MP4File &file, MP4Atom* parent, const char* type )
 774 {
 775     // type may be NULL only in case of root-atom
 776     if( !type )
 777         return new MP4RootAtom(file);
 778
 779     // construct atoms which are context-savvy
 780     if( parent ) {
 781         const char* const ptype = parent->GetType();
 782
 783         if( descendsFrom( parent, "ilst" )) {
 784             if( ATOMID( ptype ) == ATOMID( "ilst" ))
 785                 return new MP4ItemAtom( file, type );
 786
 787             if( ATOMID( type ) == ATOMID( "data" ))
 788                 return new MP4DataAtom(file);

However, if a crafted MP4 file has the following structure:

[ilst box] -> [ilst box] -> [data box]

Then `MP4ItemAtom` would be created for the data box instead of
`MP4DataAtom`, since its parent is still of type `ilst`.

========= type confusion =========

Now, to parse the tag info of the MP4 file, `Tags::c_fetch` is called,
which invokes `genericGetItems`:

293 MP4ItmfItemList*
294 genericGetItems( MP4File& file )
295 {
296     MP4Atom* ilst = file.FindAtom( "moov.udta.meta.ilst" );
297     if( !ilst )
298         return __itemListAlloc();
299
300     const uint32_t itemCount = ilst->GetNumberOfChildAtoms();
301     if( itemCount < 1 )
302         return __itemListAlloc();
303
304     MP4ItmfItemList& list = *__itemListAlloc();
305     __itemListResize( list, itemCount );
306
307     for( uint32_t i = 0; i < list.size; i++ )
308         __itemAtomToModel( *(MP4ItemAtom*)ilst->GetChildAtom( i ),
list.elements[i] );
309
310     return &list;
311 }

Here we first find the atom for `ilst`, and then iterate its child
atoms. Remember that there's a duplicate `ilst` in the crafted MP4
file, in which case the root `ilst` atom's child is a `MP4ItemAtom` of
type `ilst`, and its grandchild is a `MP4ItemAtom` of type `data`.

Then in the function `__itemAtomToModel`, the `MP4ItemAtom` of type
`ilst` is parsed:

153 static bool
154 __itemAtomToModel( MP4ItemAtom& item_atom, MP4ItmfItem& model )
...
193     // pass 2: populate data model
194     for( uint32_t i = 0, idata = 0; i < childCount; i++ ) {
195         MP4Atom* atom = item_atom.GetChildAtom( i );
196         if( ATOMID( atom->GetType() ) != ATOMID( "data" ))
197             continue;
198
199         MP4DataAtom& data_atom = *(MP4DataAtom*)atom;

We can see that line 199 would cast its child to `MP4DataAtom`
directly, which in fact is a `MP4ItemAtom`. Since these two objects
are of different layout, operations on the `data_atom` could lead to
memory corruption due to the type confusion.

========= POC =========

Here we create a MP4 file with two `ilst`s:

It results in segfault when running `mp4info`:
