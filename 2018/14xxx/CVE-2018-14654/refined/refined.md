  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The \"features/index\" translator in GlusterFS does not properly handle client requests. Specifically, it allows arbitrary values for `GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_IN_KEY` and `GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_OUT_KEY` during xattrop file operation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Arbitrary file creation",
      "Arbitrary file deletion"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker can create and delete arbitrary, empty files on the glusterfs server node.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting the `GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_IN_KEY` xattrop during xattrop file operations, a remote attacker with access to mount volumes can create arbitrary empty files.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to mount volumes on the glusterfs server.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in glusterfs versions through 4.1.4. The vulnerability is exposed to hypervisor administrators in recommended configurations of Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. The issue was fixed upstream with the commit <https://review.gluster.org/#/c/glusterfs/+/21534/>."
