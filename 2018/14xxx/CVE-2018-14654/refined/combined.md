| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-09-21 01:00:20 UTC  ``` The Gluster file system through version 4.1.4 is vulnerable to abuse of the "features/index" translator. A remote attacker with access to mount volumes could exploit this via the "GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_IN_KEY" xattrop to create arbitrary, empty files on the target server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-09-21 01:01:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-24 05:16:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.  This flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c5)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-10-31 08:12:12 UTC  ``` Created glusterfs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1644580](show_bug.cgi?id=1644580 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14654 glusterfs: \"features/index\" translator can create arbitrary, empty files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-31 08:42:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 6   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:3431 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3431](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3431)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-31 08:43:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 7   Native Client for RHEL 7 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:3432 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3432](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3432)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c8)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-11-01 16:19:17 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <https://review.gluster.org/#/c/glusterfs/+/21534/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 14:58:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3470 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3470](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3470)   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3431)

## Topic

Updated glusterfs packages that fix multiple security issues and bugs are now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

GlusterFS is a key building block of Red Hat Gluster Storage. It is based on a stackable user-space design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnections into one large, parallel network file system.

Security Fix(es):

* glusterfs: glusterfs server exploitable via symlinks to relative paths (CVE-2018-14651)
* glusterfs: Buffer overflow in "features/locks" translator allows for denial of service (CVE-2018-14652)
* glusterfs: Heap-based buffer overflow via "gf\_getspec\_req" RPC message (CVE-2018-14653)
* glusterfs: "features/index" translator can create arbitrary, empty files (CVE-2018-14654)
* glusterfs: Unlimited file creation via "GF\_XATTR\_IOSTATS\_DUMP\_KEY" xattr allows for denial of service (CVE-2018-14659)
* glusterfs: Repeat use of "GF\_META\_LOCK\_KEY" xattr allows for memory exhaustion (CVE-2018-14660)
* glusterfs: features/locks translator passes an user-controlled string to snprintf without a proper format string resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2018-14661)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting these issues.

This update provides the following bug fix(es):

* MD5 instances are replaced with FIPS compliant SHA256 checksums and

glusterd no longer crashes when run on a FIPS enabled machine. (BZ#1459709)

* The flock is unlocked specifically and the status file is updated so that

the reference is not leaked to any worker or agent process. As a result of
this fix, all workers come up without fail. (BZ#1623749)

* All HTIME index files are checked for the specified start and end times,

and the History API does not fail when multiple HTIME files exist.
(BZ#1627639)

* After upgrading to Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 from earlier versions of

Red Hat Gluster Storage, the volume size displayed by the df command was
smaller than the actual volume size. This has been fixed and the df command
now shows the correct size for all volumes. (BZ#1630997)

* The algorithm to disable the eager-lock is modified and it disables only

when multiple write operations are trying to modify a file at the same
time. This led to performance improvement while a write operation is
performed on a file irrespective of the number of times it is opened at the
same time for a read operation. (BZ#1630688)

* heal-info does not consider the presence of dirty markers as an

indication of split-brain and does not display these entries to be in a
split-brain state. (BZ#1610743)

All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which provide numerous bug fixes and enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1632585#c0)  nijin ashok    2018-09-25 07:42:31 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The host is having the custom configuration "issue_discards = 1" in the lvm.conf on hypervisor. So if we execute any lvremove command, it will ask for confirmation as below.  lvremove rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1;echo $? Do you really want to remove and DISCARD logical volume rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1? [y/n]: y  While removing the old layers, the lvremove is executed without "force" option. So the lvremove command will give an exit status of 5 because of the above confirmation and it will fail with the error below.  === 2018-09-18 15:08:16,196 [DEBUG] (MainThread) Calling: (['lvremove', u'rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1'],) {'close_fds': True, 'stderr': <open file '/dev/null', mode 'w' at 0x7f757fe94030>} 2018-09-18 15:08:16,308 [DEBUG] (MainThread) Exception! 2018-09-18 15:08:16,308 [ERROR] (MainThread) Update failed, resetting registered LVs  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/runpy.py", line 162, in _run_module_as_main     "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/runpy.py", line 72, in _run_code     exec code in run_globals   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/__main__.py", line 53, in <module>     CliApplication()   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/__init__.py", line 82, in CliApplication     app.hooks.emit("post-arg-parse", args)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/hooks.py", line 120, in emit     cb(self.context, *args)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/plugins/update.py", line 68, in post_argparse     six.reraise(*exc_info)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/plugins/update.py", line 63, in post_argparse     GarbageCollector(app.imgbase).run(base, keep)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/plugins/update.py", line 199, in run     self.imgbase.remove_base(base.nvr)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/imgbase.py", line 332, in remove_base     self.remove_layer(layer.nvr)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/imgbase.py", line 351, in remove_layer     lv.remove()   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/lvm.py", line 261, in remove     LVM._lvremove(cmd)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/utils.py", line 393, in lvremove     return self.call(["lvremove"] + args, **kwargs)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/utils.py", line 469, in call     return super(LvmBinary, self).call(*args, stderr=DEVNULL, **kwargs)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/utils.py", line 378, in call     stdout = call(*args, **kwargs)   File "/tmp/tmp.33vZVUL00H/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/imgbased/utils.py", line 153, in call     return subprocess.check_output(*args, **kwargs).strip()   File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 575, in check_output     raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd, output=output) subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['lvremove', u'rhvh/rhvh-4.1-0.20180314.0+1']' returned non-zero exit status 5 ===   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  imgbased-1.0.24  How reproducible:  100 %  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Change issue_discards = 1 in lvm.conf 2. Update the host which is having 3 or more layers. While deleting the old layer LV, it will fail with the mentioned error.  Actual results:  The upgrade is failing because lvremove asks for confirmation before removing the LV.  Expected results:  The upgrade should work. Maybe we can use --force option in lvremove?

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-09-21 01:00:20 UTC  ``` The Gluster file system through version 4.1.4 is vulnerable to abuse of the "features/index" translator. A remote attacker with access to mount volumes could exploit this via the "GF_XATTROP_ENTRY_IN_KEY" xattrop to create arbitrary, empty files on the target server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-09-21 01:01:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-09-24 05:16:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 as the flaw is present in glusterfs-server, which is not shipped there.  This flaw affects glusterfs versions included in Red Hat Virtualization 4 Hypervisor. However, in recommended configurations, the vulnerability is only exposed to hypervisor administrators and can not be exploited from virtual machines or other hosts on the network.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c5)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-10-31 08:12:12 UTC  ``` Created glusterfs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1644580](show_bug.cgi?id=1644580 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14654 glusterfs: \"features/index\" translator can create arbitrary, empty files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-31 08:42:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 6   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:3431 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3431](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3431)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-31 08:43:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 for RHEL 7   Native Client for RHEL 7 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHSA-2018:3432 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3432](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3432)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c8)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-11-01 16:19:17 UTC  ``` upstream fix:  <https://review.gluster.org/#/c/glusterfs/+/21534/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1631576#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-11-05 14:58:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:3470 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3470](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3470)   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 909215

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in GlusterFS, a
clustered file system. Buffer overflows and path traversal issues may
lead to information disclosure, denial-of-service or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.8.8-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your glusterfs packages.

For the detailed security status of glusterfs please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/glusterfs>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3432)

## Topic

Updated glusterfs packages that fix multiple security issues and bugs are now available for Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

GlusterFS is a key building block of Red Hat Gluster Storage. It is based on a stackable user-space design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. GlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnections into one large, parallel network file system.

Security Fix(es):

* glusterfs: glusterfs server exploitable via symlinks to relative paths (CVE-2018-14651)
* glusterfs: Buffer overflow in "features/locks" translator allows for denial of service (CVE-2018-14652)
* glusterfs: Heap-based buffer overflow via "gf\_getspec\_req" RPC message (CVE-2018-14653)
* glusterfs: "features/index" translator can create arbitrary, empty files (CVE-2018-14654)
* glusterfs: Unlimited file creation via "GF\_XATTR\_IOSTATS\_DUMP\_KEY" xattr allows for denial of service (CVE-2018-14659)
* glusterfs: Repeat use of "GF\_META\_LOCK\_KEY" xattr allows for memory exhaustion (CVE-2018-14660)
* glusterfs: features/locks translator passes an user-controlled string to snprintf without a proper format string resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2018-14661)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting these issues.

Bug Fix(es):

* MD5 instances are replaced with FIPS-compliant SHA256 checksums and glusterd no longer crashes when run on a FIPS enabled machine. (BZ#1459709)
* The flock is unlocked specifically and the status file is updated so that the reference is not leaked to any worker or agent process. As a result of this fix, all workers come up without fail. (BZ#1623749)
* All HTIME index files are checked for the specified start and end times, and the History API does not fail when multiple HTIME files exist. (BZ#1627639)
* After upgrading to Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.4 from earlier versions of Red Hat Gluster Storage, the volume size displayed by the df command was smaller than the actual volume size. This has been fixed and the df command now shows the correct size for all volumes. (BZ#1630997)
* The algorithm to disable the eager-lock is modified and it disables only when multiple write operations are trying to modify a file at the same time. This led to performance improvement while a write operation is performed on a file irrespective of the number of times it is opened at the same time for a read operation. (BZ#1630688)
* heal-info does not consider the presence of dirty markers as an indication of split-brain and does not display these entries to be in a split-brain state. (BZ#1610743)

All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which provide numerous bug fixes and enhancements.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3470)

## Topic

An update for imgbased, redhat-release-virtualization-host, and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.

Security Fix(es):

* spice: Missing check in demarshal.py:write\_validate\_array\_item() allows for buffer overflow and denial of service (CVE-2018-10873)
* glusterfs: Multiple flaws (CVE-2018-10904, CVE-2018-10907, CVE-2018-10923, CVE-2018-10926, CVE-2018-10927, CVE-2018-10928, CVE-2018-10929, CVE-2018-10930, CVE-2018-10911, CVE-2018-10914, CVE-2018-14652, CVE-2018-14653, CVE-2018-14654, CVE-2018-14659, CVE-2018-14660, CVE-2018-14661, CVE-2018-10913)
* samba: Insufficient input validation in libsmbclient (CVE-2018-10858)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Michael Hanselmann (hansmi.ch) for reporting CVE-2018-10904, CVE-2018-10907, CVE-2018-10923, CVE-2018-10926, CVE-2018-10927, CVE-2018-10928, CVE-2018-10929, CVE-2018-10930, CVE-2018-10911, CVE-2018-10914, CVE-2018-14652, CVE-2018-14653, CVE-2018-14654, CVE-2018-14659, CVE-2018-14660, CVE-2018-14661, and CVE-2018-10913. The CVE-2018-10873 issue was discovered by Frediano Ziglio (Red Hat).

Bug Fix(es):

* When upgrading Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH), imgbased fails to run garbage collection on previous layers, so new logical volumes are removed, and the boot entry points to a logical volume that was removed.

If the RHVH upgrade finishes successfully, the hypervisor boots successfully, even if garbage collection fails. (BZ#1632058)

* During the upgrade process, when lvremove runs garbage collection, it prompts for user confirmation, causing the upgrade process to fail. Now the process uses "lvremove --force" when trying to remove logical volumes and does not fail even if garbage collection fails, and as a result, the upgrade process finishes successfully. (BZ#1632585)
