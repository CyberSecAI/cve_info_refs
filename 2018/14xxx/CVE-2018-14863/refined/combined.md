## Description

[![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)](/odony)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/32508#issue-430456676)
# Security Advisory - ODOO-SA-2018-08-07-8

Incorrect access control in the RPC framework in Odoo Community 8.0 through 11.0 and Odoo Enterprise 9.0 through 11.0 allows authenticated users to call private functions via RPC.

**Affects**: Odoo 9.0, 10.0, 11.0 (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**Component**: Odoo Framework

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2018-14863](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-14863)

## I. Background

As of Odoo 8.0, the Odoo framework was considerably changed by the

introduction of a new abstraction layer to communicate with the database,

dubbed the "new API".

To simplify the transition, the new API was initially written with a

backwards-compatibility layer so that it could support modules written for

older versions with limited changes.

## II. Problem Description

A programming error in the backwards-compatibility layer allows bypassing the

access control and remotely accessing private functions.

## III. Impact

Access Vector: Network exploitable

Access Complexity: Low

**Authentication**: User account required

**CVSS3 Score**: High :: 8.1

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

By crafting a specific RPC request, malicious users (including portal users)

may call private methods, not normally exposed via the RPC API.

An attacker may be able to use them outside of the intended scope to retrieve or

alter information stored in the database.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability.

## IV. Workaround

No workaround is known, applying the patch is strongly recommended.

Odoo Online servers have been patched as soon as the correction was

available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or update to

the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading it:

<https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

For the actual update procedure, please refer to our update instructions, valid

for all versions:

<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/11.0/setup/update.html>

If you choose to apply the patch instead, change into the main directory of

your Odoo installation (the one containing "odoo" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 9.0: [a1b92ad](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/a1b92ad2b8aa2873e8707ef13660771fd75dba8e)
* 10.0: [2c9c7e7](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/2c9c7e770addb152f6d424c3ea0f6ac9bcc25a56)
* 11.0: [ff45f22](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/ff45f227505df644c70bd02d804f48b3c3e54601)
* 11.0-ent, 10.0-ent and 9.0-ent (Enterprise): see 11.0, 10.0 and 9.0.
