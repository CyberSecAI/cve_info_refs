Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-14863:

**Root Cause:**

- A programming error in the backwards-compatibility layer of Odoo's new API, introduced in version 8.0, allowed bypassing access controls. This layer was designed to support older modules, but a flaw enabled unauthorized access to private functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary vulnerability lies in the inadequate access control within Odoo's RPC framework. This allowed authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Private Function Exposure:** The vulnerability permits remote access to private functions that should not be accessible through the RPC API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure/Modification:** An attacker could exploit this to retrieve or alter information stored in the database by using these private functions outside their intended scope.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to access private methods could potentially lead to privilege escalation depending on the functionality of the methods.
- **Data Manipulation**:  The attacker can potentially manipulate data stored in the database, leading to data integrity issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is network-exploitable.
- **RPC Requests:** The attack is performed by crafting specific RPC requests to call the private functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability (including portal users).
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send RPC requests to the Odoo server.

**Affected Versions:**

- Odoo Community 8.0 through 11.0
- Odoo Enterprise 9.0 through 11.0

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a CVSS v3 score of 8.1 with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`, further clarifying the high impact due to high confidentiality and integrity impact, and low complexity, with low privileges needed and no user interaction
- The vulnerability was fixed in revisions a1b92ad (9.0), 2c9c7e7 (10.0), ff45f22 (11.0).
- No workaround was available, the patch was strongly recommended.
