The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-14697.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `username` parameter in the `enable_user` endpoint of the DroboAccess web application is reflected in the server's response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `username` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the server's response, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This could allow an attacker to perform actions like session hijacking, defacing the website, or redirecting the victim to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the `enable_user` endpoint with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `username` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Drobo device and the ability to send HTTP requests to it. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
