- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `realpath()` function is used with a fixed-size buffer on non-Apple systems in `geotag.cpp`, instead of dynamically allocating a buffer of sufficient size or using a stack buffer of appropriate size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient buffer size passed to `realpath()` on non-Apple systems.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Passing a long path to the vulnerable code may cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a long path as an argument to the affected code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input paths to the program using the vulnerable `geotag.cpp` file.

The provided content gives more details than a typical CVE description, including the specific code location and explanation of the vulnerability, along with a mention of the lack of using `pathconf` for buffer sizing.
