    "summary": "Foxit Reader PolyLine Annotation addAdLayer Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
    "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of PolyLine annotations. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
