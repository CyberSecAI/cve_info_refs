*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to administrative functionalities of the DroboAccess application without proper credentials.
*   **Potential System Compromise:**  Though the exact administrative functions accessible are not specified, the document implies potential for further attacks based on the other vulnerabilities found within the DroboAccess application (command injection). 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the Drobo NAS device.
*  **Web Requests:** The attacker can interact with the vulnerable administrative pages by sending HTTP requests via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Drobo 5N2 device.
*   **No Special Credentials:** The attacker does not require any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can access the administrative pages without authentication, directly.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The DroboAccess web application is not installed by default but it's expected that average user will install it.
