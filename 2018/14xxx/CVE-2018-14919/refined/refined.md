Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2018-14919:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization in the web interface of the affected Loytec LGATE-902 gateway devices. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which exists in both reflected and stored forms.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Occurs when user-supplied input is reflected back in the server's response without proper sanitization.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Occurs when malicious input is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database or file) and later displayed to other users without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session tokens or other sensitive information, which can lead to complete account compromise.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the user, like network reconnaissance or traffic tunneling.
*   **Internal network compromise:** Attackers can use tools such as BeEF to further compromise internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered via crafted HTTP requests to the web interface of the LGATE-902 gateway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable LGATE-902 device.
*   **Web Interface Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the device.
*  **No Authentication required**: The provided PoC examples show that no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Specific Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Product:** Loytec LGATE-902 Gateway
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 6.4.2 (tested on version 6.3.2)
*   **Reflected XSS PoC:** `http://<device_address>/webui/data/alarm_log_obj?handle=1000%27-alert(1)-%27&page=0`
*   **Stored XSS PoC:**
    ```
    POST http://<device_address>/webui/config/doc/action
    save=1&update=1&data=[["test","</script><script>alert(1);</script>",2]]
    ```
*   **Patch Availability:** Version 6.4.2 fixes this vulnerability.
