Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-14781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper authentication in the wireless communication between the Medtronic MiniMed MMT-500/MMT-503 remote controllers and compatible insulin pumps. This allows for capture-replay attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay (CWE-294): Wireless transmissions between the remote controller and the insulin pump can be intercepted and replayed to trigger unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can replay captured wireless communications to cause an insulin (bolus) delivery.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through the interception and retransmission of wireless communications between the remote controller and the insulin pump.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless communication range of the remote controller and the pump.
- The attacker must have the capability to capture wireless transmissions.
- The "easy bolus" and "remote bolus" options on the insulin pump must be enabled (which is a non-default configuration).
- High skill level is needed to exploit.
