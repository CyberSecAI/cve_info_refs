- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The device does not perform a check on the length/size of a project file before copying the entire contents of the file to a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow for arbitrary remote code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, by sending a specially crafted project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the vulnerable device, low skill level required to exploit. Public exploits are available.
