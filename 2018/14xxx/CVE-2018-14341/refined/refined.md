Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-14341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The DICOM dissector in Wireshark did not properly check for packet offset overflows, which could lead to a large or infinite loop. Specifically the issue was a missing check preventing an offset overflow in `epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is the potential for the DICOM dissector to enter a large or infinite loop due to the lack of proper offset validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources, effectively leading to a DoS condition. This can occur when a malformed packet is received by the vulnerable dissector.
    *   Wireshark becomes unresponsive
    *   Consumes excessive CPU resources

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject a specifically crafted malformed DICOM packet onto the network.
*   **Malicious Trace File:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file (pcap) containing malformed DICOM packets that trigger the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send or inject malformed DICOM packets onto the network being monitored by Wireshark.
*   **Social Engineering:** For the trace file attack, the attacker must be able to persuade a user to load a malicious pcap file in Wireshark.
*   **No special privileges**: Exploitation can be achieved without authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15.
*   The fix involves preventing offset overflows in `epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c`
*   The vulnerability is rated as having low severity by SUSE and a network availability impact.
*   The original report can be found in the Wireshark bug tracker as issue 14742
