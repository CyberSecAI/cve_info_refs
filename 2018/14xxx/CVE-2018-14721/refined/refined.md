## Analysis of CVE-2018-14721

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-14721:

**1. Verification:**

The content from multiple sources (Red Hat Bugzilla, GitHub, Red Hat Security Advisories, and Oracle's Critical Patch Update) explicitly mentions **CVE-2018-14721** and describes a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability related to the `axis2-jaxws` class in `jackson-databind` during polymorphic deserialization.  This aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    - The vulnerability stems from the failure of `jackson-databind` to block the `axis2-jaxws` class from polymorphic deserialization. Polymorphic deserialization is a feature that allows the deserializer to determine the specific class to instantiate from the input data, making it possible for a malicious attacker to specify a dangerous class that was not intended to be deserialized.
    -  Specifically, the vulnerable component is within the `jackson-databind` library when it attempts to deserialize data using polymorphic deserialization and is exploited via failure to block the `axis2-jaxws` class, enabling a server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Polymorphic Deserialization**: The core vulnerability lies in the library's failure to properly sanitize or block certain classes during polymorphic deserialization, specifically `axis2-jaxws`. This allows attackers to supply malicious class names in the serialized data, and the system will attempt to instantiate those classes during deserialization.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: By controlling the classes that are instantiated by `jackson-databind`, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to make requests to other internal or external systems they may otherwise be restricted from accessing.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    -   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can force the vulnerable application to make requests to other systems, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation.
        - As stated in Red Hat Bugzilla comment #0, "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by leveraging failure to block the axis2-jaxws class from polymorphic deserialization."
   -  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not directly described as RCE in the CVE summary, some of the comments (e.g. Red Hat Bugzilla comment 50) note that an attacker could "execute arbitrary code". It's likely this RCE is a side effect of the improperly deserialized object and subsequent code execution.
    -   The RHSA-2019:1140 advisory says,  “jackson-databind: server-side request forgery (SSRF) in axis2-jaxws class (CVE-2018-14721)” and "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by leveraging failure to block the axis2-jaxws class from polymorphic deserialization."

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Polymorphic Deserialization:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting specially serialized JSON data that includes references to the vulnerable `axis2-jaxws` class (or another vulnerable class which can be used to perform an SSRF) during polymorphic deserialization.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network as the crafted data can be sent over the network to the application for processing.
*   **Input Data:** The attack vector is through the input JSON data stream that the application processes.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send JSON data**: An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted JSON data to an application which uses `jackson-databind` for deserialization. This could be accomplished through an API endpoint or other mechanism where JSON data is processed.
*   **No Authentication**: Many of the sources indicate that this vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication. This means that an attacker need not be a valid or registered user to initiate an exploit.

**Additional Notes from Analyzed Content:**

*   **Specific Affected Versions**:  The vulnerability affects `jackson-databind` 2.x versions before 2.9.7, 2.8.x up to 2.8.11.2 and 2.7.x up to 2.7.9.4. 
*   **Patched Versions**: The vulnerability is fixed in `jackson-databind` versions 2.9.7, 2.8.11.3, 2.7.9.5.
*   **Various Affected Products**: Many products across Red Hat and Oracle, as listed in advisories, were impacted as they use the vulnerable jackson-databind library. These include Red Hat Software Collections, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat Decision Manager, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Oracle Database Server, Oracle Communications Products, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and more.
*   **Upstream Patch**: The upstream patch was made by FasterXML and is available here: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44>
*   **Mitigation**: One of the comments indicated that some products may not be affected because they didn't include or load the vulnerable `axis2-jaxws` library. Therefore, applications that don't load the vulnerable class might not be affected even if they use a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind`.

This analysis combines information from various sources to provide a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-14721.
