Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-14523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `new_aubio_pitchyinfft` function within `pitch/pitchyinfft.c` of the aubio library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Over-read:** The code reads beyond the allocated bounds of a buffer named `freqs`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The over-read can lead to a crash of the application using the aubio library, as observed in the provided AddressSanitizer output.
- **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to information leakage, as indicated in the description. An attacker might be able to read adjacent memory locations, exposing sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `aubionotes` utility. It is a command-line tool that processes audio files and uses aubio's features.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted audio file (e.g. `testcase2`).
- The attack vector is described as "network" with a "medium" complexity on CVSS v2 and "network" with "low" complexity but "user interaction" required on CVSS v3. This implies that an attacker could exploit this by getting the victim to process a malicious audio file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specifically crafted audio file to the application using the vulnerable aubio library.
- User interaction is required for successful exploitation, the user needs to process the crafted audio file.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs within the `new_aubio_pitchyinfft` function at line 75 in `pitch/pitchyinfft.c`.
- The `freqs` array, defined at `pitch/pitchyinfft.c:43`, with a size of 136 bytes, is being read out of bounds.
- The AddressSanitizer output shows a "global-buffer-overflow" at address `0x7f0d1bcfb8c8`, which is located right after the `freqs` array.

**Additional Information**

- The vulnerability was fixed in aubio version 0.4.9 and later.
- The SUSE bugzilla entry 1102364 tracks the fix for this CVE.
- This vulnerability is associated with the `aubionotes` example application.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted audio file.
- Patches for this vulnerability were released by openSUSE.
