- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the "PHP Template Store Script" application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize input fields such as "Address line 1", "Address Line 2", "Bank name", and "A/C Holder name" before storing them in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This leads to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields. When a user views the affected areas of the application, the injected JavaScript code will execute within their browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web application's user interface. A malicious user can register on the site, log in, and navigate to the personal information section to inject the malicious script into the specified fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the vulnerable application. They also need to be able to access the "Personal Information" settings page.
