  "CVE-2018-14647": {
    "description": "Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM. The vulnerability exists in Python versions 3.7.0, 3.6.0 through 3.6.6, 3.5.0 through 3.5.6, 3.4.0 through 3.4.9, 2.7.0 through 2.7.15.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "python2.7",
      "python3.4",
       "python3.5",
      "python3.6",
      "python",
      "libexpat"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The C accelerated _elementtree module did not initialize the hash randomization salt from _Py_HashSecret, instead relying on libexpat's default CSPRNG which on some platforms (older Linux, BSD, and other Unix systems using /dev/urandom), falls back to a weak Mersenne Twister-like RNG, making it easier to cause hash collisions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper initialization of hash salt",
        "Use of a weak RNG for hash salt generation"
      ],
       "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to pathological hash collisions in Expat's internal data structures consuming excessive CPU and RAM resources.",
       "attack_vector": "Network (through specially crafted XML document). Local if attacker has access to the system.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have the ability to send or provide a specially crafted XML document to the affected application"
    },
     "additional_information": "This vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-9636. Upstream fix is to initialize hash salt from _Py_HashSecret instead of libexpat's default CSPRNG"
