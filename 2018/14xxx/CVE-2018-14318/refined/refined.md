{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of IPCP headers within the Samsung Galaxy S8's Shannon GPRS stack. The issue stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the baseband processor.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is remote and requires the target device to have its cellular radios enabled. The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted IPCP headers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted IPCP packets to a vulnerable Samsung Galaxy S8 with cellular radios enabled. This implies a network-level position, or the ability to control the victim's network traffic."
