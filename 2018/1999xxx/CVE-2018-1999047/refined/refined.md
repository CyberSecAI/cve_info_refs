- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of permission checks on the URL used to cancel scheduled restart jobs initiated via the update center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a lack of authorization that allows users with Overall/Read permissions to access the cancel scheduled restart URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with Overall/Read permission can cancel scheduled restarts initiated via the update center, leading to a denial of service (though limited).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is accessing the URL used to cancel scheduled restarts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have Overall/Read permission. The attacker does not need to be logged in.
