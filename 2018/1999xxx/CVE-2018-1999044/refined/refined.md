- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The form validation for cron expressions could enter infinite loops.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A crafted cron expression can cause the form validation process to enter an infinite loop, blocking request handling threads.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Denial of service due to the request handling threads being blocked indefinitely.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with the ability to input cron expressions (e.g., in "Poll SCM" or "Build periodically" configurations) can provide a crafted expression that triggers the infinite loop.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least low privileges (PR:L) to configure the cron expression within Jenkins. The attack can be performed over the network (AV:N), and does not require user interaction (UI:N).
