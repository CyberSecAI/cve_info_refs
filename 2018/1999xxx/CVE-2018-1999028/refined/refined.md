Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999028:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1999028

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Accurev Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method that implements form validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing permission checks on an API endpoint.
- CSRF vulnerability due to the lack of POST request requirement.
- Exposure of credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could connect to an attacker-specified Accurev server.
- Attackers can capture credentials stored in Jenkins by using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through other means.
- Could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Accurev server and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- Attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
- Exploitation can be done via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- Ability to craft malicious HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of credential IDs stored within Jenkins.

**Summary:**
The Accurev plugin had a vulnerability where it did not properly validate permissions when submitting form data, and additionally was vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it didn't require a POST request.  This could be exploited by an attacker with low-level access to the Jenkins server. This allowed them to initiate connections to a malicious Accurev server using supplied credential IDs, thereby exposing any credentials stored in Jenkins.
