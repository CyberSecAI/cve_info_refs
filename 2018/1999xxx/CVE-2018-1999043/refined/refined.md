**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An ephemeral user record was created when attempting to authenticate using an API token, especially if an external security realm was used and the user record was not previously saved. This was due to legacy API tokens existing without a persisted user record and the need to validate these tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unnecessary creation of ephemeral user records during API token authentication.
- Lack of proper handling of API token validation, leading to ephemeral user creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this behavior to create a large number of ephemeral user records, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can make repeated authentication attempts using API tokens to trigger the creation of ephemeral user records.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send authentication requests to the Jenkins instance using API tokens. No specific position is mentioned, meaning a remote, unauthenticated user could be capable of exploiting this.
