The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins, but **CVE-2018-1999035** specifically refers to a vulnerability in the **Inedo BuildMaster Plugin**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Inedo BuildMaster Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation globally, making all connections from the Jenkins controller vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack could allow an attacker to intercept and modify data transmitted between the Jenkins controller and other servers, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over connected systems.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the lack of certificate validation when connecting to external resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins controller and other servers, e.g., by being on the same network or by controlling a network device. No specific user-level access to Jenkins is required (PR:N).
