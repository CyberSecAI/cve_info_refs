Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop within the `read_part_of_packet()` function in the PVA format demuxer of the libav library (part of FFmpeg). This occurs when processing a specific type of PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) data within a PVA file. The code would retry reading a part of a packet without checking for EOF (End of File) conditions, leading to the infinite loop if the expected PES data is not present or malformed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is the infinite loop, a classic denial-of-service vulnerability. This is caused by the function `read_part_of_packet()` not checking for the EOF condition before attempting to re-read packet data.
- **Lack of EOF Check:** The `avio_feof(pb)` check was missing prior to the fix in the while loop in `read_part_of_packet()`, resulting in the infinite loop when the end of the input was reached before finding the required PES header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The infinite loop consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, potentially making the system or application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PVA File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted PVA file. An attacker needs to provide this malicious file as input to a system or application using the vulnerable libav/FFmpeg library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide or cause the processing of the crafted PVA file by the vulnerable software. This could be through a file upload, a network stream, or any other way to provide input to FFmpeg or a program using it.
- **No Special Privileges:**  No specific privileges are required, exploitation is triggered by providing a crafted input file.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue is a check for `avio_feof(pb)` (End of file check) within the `read_part_of_packet()` function within `libavformat/pva.c` before attempting to re-read from the input stream.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-835 (Infinite Loop).
- The vulnerability was fixed in FFmpeg commit 9807d3976be0e92e4ece3b4b1701be894cd7c2e1.

**Summary:** This CVE describes an infinite loop vulnerability in the PVA demuxer of libav (FFmpeg). Attackers can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted PVA file, causing excessive resource consumption. The vulnerability is mitigated by checking for EOF conditions before attempting to re-read data, which was implemented in commit 9807d3976be0e92e4ece3b4b1701be894cd7c2e1.
