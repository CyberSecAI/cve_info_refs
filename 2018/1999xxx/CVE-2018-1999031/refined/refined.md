The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1999031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The meliora-testlab Plugin stored the API Key in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller. This key could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system. Additionally, the API key was not masked from view using a password form field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storage of API key in plain text in the global configuration file
- API key is not masked from view in the configuration form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the API key and use it to access the meliora-testlab API.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing the Jenkins controller file system.
- Viewing the unmasked API key on the configuration form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller file system, typically requiring at least shell access to the server.
- The ability to view the unmasked API key in the plugin's configuration form.
