The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1999030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Maven Artifact ChoiceListProvider (Nexus) Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks: The plugin lacked proper checks on a form validation method, allowing unauthorized access.
- CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could connect to an attacker-specified Nexus or Artifactory server.
- The attacker could use attacker-specified credential IDs to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks through a Jenkins instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to know/specify the credential IDs of the targeted credential to use for the attack.
- The attacker can trick a user into visiting a crafted webpage that triggers the vulnerable functionality without the user's consent or knowledge.
