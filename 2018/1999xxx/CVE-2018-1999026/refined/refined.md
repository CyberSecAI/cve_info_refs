Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999026:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content does not include a specific description of CVE-2018-1999026, however it does state: "CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin allowed server-side request forgery"

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of permission checks on a form validation method within the TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin. This oversight allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate requests to an arbitrary URL by controlling the plugin's configuration. Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, which exposed a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin lacked proper authorization checks on a form validation method.
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method did not require POST requests, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could manipulate the plugin to make requests to attacker controlled URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could initiate requests to an attacker-specified URL (with the suffix `/app-version-info`).
- This could lead to information disclosure or allow the attacker to further compromise the internal network by interacting with other internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits the missing permission check and lack of CSRF protection in the form validation method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker does not need special network access, because they are using the Jenkins server to make the requests.

**Additional Notes:**
The fix for this vulnerability involves:
- Requiring POST requests for the vulnerable form validation method to prevent CSRF attacks
- Enforcing Overall/Administer permissions for the method to ensure that only administrators can configure this feature.
- Plugin version 2.4 and later contain the fix
