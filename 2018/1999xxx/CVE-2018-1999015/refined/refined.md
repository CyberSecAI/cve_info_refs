Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-array read in the `read_quant_matrix_ext` function within the `mpeg4videodec.c` file, specifically when parsing the quantization matrix extensions in an MPEG-4 video bitstream. This occurs when there are not enough bits left in the bitstream to read a complete quantization matrix.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer when parsing quantization matrices. The code does not properly validate if there are enough bits available in the bitstream before attempting to read the matrix data, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Memory Read:** An attacker can potentially read heap memory contents, which could lead to information disclosure.
- **Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted ASF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted ASF file, indicating that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious file as input.
- **Network:** The attack vector is classified as network-based. This would suggest an attack scenario where a user would be tricked into opening a malicious file received via the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as a user opening a malicious video file.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in the `read_quant_matrix_ext` function in `libavcodec/mpeg4videodec.c`.
- The fix implemented by commit `5aba5b89d0b1d73164d3b81764828bb8b20ff32a` adds checks using `get_bits_left(gb)` to ensure there are enough bits in the bitstream before reading quantization matrix data.
- The affected code involves parsing of `intra_quantiser_matrix`, `non_intra_quantiser_matrix`, `chroma_intra_quantiser_matrix`, and `chroma_non_intra_quantiser_matrix`.
- The vulnerability is related to the ASF format demuxer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The GitHub advisory notes that the vulnerability was fixed in commit `5aba5b89d0b1d73164d3b81764828bb8b20ff32a` and later.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, which indicates a moderate severity.
- There is an EPSS score of 0.113%, suggesting a low probability of exploitation in the next 30 days.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).
