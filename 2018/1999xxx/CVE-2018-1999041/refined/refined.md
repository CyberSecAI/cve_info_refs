Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999041:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tinfoil Security Plugin stored the API Secret Key in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive information (API Secret Key).
- Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized disclosure of the API Secret Key.
- Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system could view the unencrypted API Secret Key.
- Potential for unauthorized access and actions within the Tinfoil Security service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system, which could be achieved by compromising the system or having legitimate, but not privileged, user access to the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The plugin now integrates with the Credentials Plugin, which handles storage of sensitive information securely.
- The advisory mentions that existing configurations will not be migrated and will need to be reconfigured.
- The fix involves storing the API Key encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transferring it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
- Affected versions: Tinfoil Security Plugin up to and including 1.6.1
- Fixed version: Tinfoil Security Plugin 2.0
