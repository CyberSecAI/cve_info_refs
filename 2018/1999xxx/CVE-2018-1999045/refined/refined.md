- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Remember me" cookie was evaluated even when the feature was disabled in the Jenkins security configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application did not properly disable the processing of "Remember me" cookies when the feature was turned off, allowing users to be logged in via those cookies despite the feature being disabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to a user's account if the attacker has obtained a valid "Remember me" cookie for that user, even if the "Remember me" feature has been disabled in the Jenkins settings.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to obtain a valid "Remember me" cookie from a user. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have gained access to a user's valid "remember me" cookie and the "Remember me" feature needs to have been disabled after the cookie was created for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server with the valid cookie.
