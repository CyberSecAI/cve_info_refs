Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999029:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Shelve Project Plugin did not properly sanitize the names of shelved projects when displaying them in the user interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The lack of output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts via project names. These scripts would then execute in the context of other users browsing the Jenkins interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other Jenkins users, leading to:
  - Data theft (e.g., session cookies, credentials)
  - Defacement of the Jenkins UI
  - Malicious actions within the Jenkins environment on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to manipulate the name of a project that is later shelved. The malicious script would be stored in the project name.
- Users with the ability to view the shelved projects would be exposed to the XSS vulnerability, as the unsanitized project name would be rendered on the UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and shelve projects in Jenkins. This typically requires at least Job/Create permission.
- The attacker needs to use a malicious project name to exploit the vulnerability.
- The victim needs to browse the interface containing the stored XSS payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves escaping the project names when they are displayed in the UI.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Shelve Project Plugin version 2.0 and newer.
- The vulnerability is listed as **SECURITY-1001**.
- The severity is considered **medium**.
- CVSS score is **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)**
