Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple out-of-array access issues within the MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol handling in the libav library. Specifically, a missing `chunksize` check in the `ff_mms_asf_header_parser` function allows for out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The primary issue is that the code does not properly validate the `chunksize` value against the available data length before accessing memory using the chunksize. This lack of bounds checking leads to accessing data beyond the allocated buffer.
- Multiple out-of-array accesses: The advisory mentions that multiple instances of out-of-array accesses exist within the MMS protocol handling, suggesting this is not an isolated issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can potentially access out-of-bound data which could contain sensitive information.
- Denial of Service (DoS): By triggering out-of-bounds reads, attackers can cause application crashes due to segmentation faults or other memory-related errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network connectivity: The vulnerability is exploitable via network connectivity, meaning a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted MMS protocol data.
- Malformed MMS data: The vulnerability is triggered by processing malformed MMS data containing an invalid chunk size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable system using the MMS protocol.
- Malicious MMS stream: The attacker needs to craft a malicious MMS stream with a specific malformed header that causes an out-of-bounds read.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in `libavformat/mms.c` within the `ff_mms_asf_header_parser` function. The commit `cced03dd667a5df6df8fd40d8de0bff477ee02e8` addresses the issue by introducing a check to ensure the chunksize is not greater than the remaining data length.

Before the fix, the code processed the MMS header in chunks based on chunksize, without verifying if the `chunksize` value was valid with respect to the remaining data.

The fix introduces the following check:
```c
if (chunksize > end - p) {
    av_log(NULL, AV_LOG_ERROR,
        "Corrupt stream (header chunksize %"PRId64" is invalid)\n",
        chunksize);
        return AVERROR_INVALIDDATA;
}
```

This check ensures that the `chunksize` does not cause out-of-bounds reads by being greater than available data length.
