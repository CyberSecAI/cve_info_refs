{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Pydio Update Engine allows authenticated administrative users to enter arbitrary URLs in the 'Update Site' field. When checking for updates, the application makes a server-side request to the provided URL and returns the content of the response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with administrative access can use the SSRF flaw to enumerate data about the internal network or to act as a proxy for further attacks. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information about the server or internal services.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to authenticate as an administrative user. They can then input a malicious URL in the 'Update Site' field located under Updater Configuration, accessible via http://pydio.host/settings/admin/action.updater. Initiating the update process will trigger a request from the server to the attacker-controlled URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Pydio instance."
