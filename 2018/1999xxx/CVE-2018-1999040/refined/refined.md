Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999040:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1999040

**Vulnerable Component:** Kubernetes Plugin for Jenkins

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Kubernetes Plugin did not enforce proper permission checks on a method that implements form validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin failed to verify if the user had the necessary permissions to access and execute the form validation method.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Capture:** An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could exploit the vulnerability to connect to an attacker-specified Kubernetes cluster using attacker-provided credential IDs. This would enable the attacker to potentially capture credentials stored within Jenkins.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with low-level access to potentially gain access to sensitive information (credentials) that should be protected

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable API endpoint of the Jenkins instance.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can use CSRF to trick authenticated users into making requests on their behalf, thus exploiting the lack of POST request enforcement.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Overall/Read access:** The attacker must have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Knowledge of Jenkins Setup:** The attacker would need some understanding of how Jenkins is set up, including where to make the malicious calls and how to get credential IDs.
*   **Ability to craft requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send HTTP requests, as well as have access to a malicious kubernetes instance.
*   **Ability to obtain credential IDs**: The attacker needs to know the credential IDs in order to use them in the exploit. This may require the attacker to have access to another vulnerability in the system, or through social engineering.

**Summary:**

The Kubernetes Plugin for Jenkins had a critical vulnerability stemming from a lack of proper permission checks and a CSRF vulnerability. This combination allowed an attacker with minimal access (Overall/Read) to potentially capture stored credentials by directing the Jenkins instance to connect to a malicious Kubernetes cluster. The fix requires the form validation methods to check for Overall/Administer permissions and to require POST requests.
