Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999002:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Stapler web framework used by Jenkins. Specifically, there was a lack of proper input validation which allowed for arbitrary file reading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary file read vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability was that an attacker could send a crafted HTTP request to Jenkins, and the Stapler framework, due to lack of input validation, would return the contents of any file on the Jenkins controller filesystem that the Jenkins controller process had access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The main impact was the disclosure of arbitrary files present on the Jenkins controller's file system. This could include sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other secrets, which could be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector was sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable Jenkins endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker only required network access to the Jenkins server in order to send the malicious HTTP request. No prior authentication was required, making this a pre-authentication vulnerability.
