- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization on the profile page editor, allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code via the homepage URL field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the context of other users' browsers when they view the attacker's profile. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1. The attacker navigates to their profile page editor (e.g., `<https://demo.gleezcms.org/user/edit>`).
    2. The attacker sets the homepage URL field to a malicious payload, such as `http://x.x/<svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`.
    3. When other users visit the attacker's profile, the malicious JavaScript payload will be executed within their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a registered user of the Gleez CMS and have access to their profile edit page.
