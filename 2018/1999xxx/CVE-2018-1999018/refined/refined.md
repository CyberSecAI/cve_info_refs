Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1999018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the antivirus plugin's configuration. Specifically, the "Antivirus Command" setting allows administrative users to specify arbitrary shell commands. These commands are executed by the web server's local user when the antivirus scan function is triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is that an authenticated administrator can inject and execute arbitrary system commands through the antivirus plugin settings. The application does not validate or sanitize the antivirus command input, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with administrative access can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full control of the system, including the ability to read sensitive files, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server or accessible via the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Administrative Interface:** The attack vector is through the Pydio administration interface, specifically the antivirus plugin configuration settings.
*   **Malicious Command Injection:** An attacker injects malicious shell commands into the "Antivirus Command" setting.
*   **Triggered Execution:** The injected commands are executed when an antivirus scan is initiated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Pydio Administrative Access:** The attacker needs valid administrator credentials to access the Pydio administration panel.
*   **Knowledge of Antivirus Plugin:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable configuration option and how to access it.
*   **Understanding of OS Commands:** The attacker must be able to craft shell commands appropriate to the target operating system.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory suggests an immediate mitigation: comment out lines 123-124 of `plugins/action.antivirus/AntivirusScanner.php` and hard code the executable string.
*  The vendor initially indicated that they would not fix the issue, stating that the administrator would often have direct access to the server.
*  The vendor has released a fix in Pydio 8.2.2 which addresses this RCE vulnerability.
