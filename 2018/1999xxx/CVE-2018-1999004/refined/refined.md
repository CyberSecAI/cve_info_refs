Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1999004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The URL used to initiate agent launches on the Jenkins controller did not perform a permission check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Missing permission check on the agent launch URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could initiate agent launches without proper authorization.
*   Initiating a launch for a specific agent cancels all ongoing launches for that agent, effectively preventing the agent from launching. This could lead to a denial of service for that particular agent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Sending a crafted HTTP request to the agent launch URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows a user with only read permissions to prevent an agent from connecting by repeatedly aborting its launch attempts. This issue is addressed by enforcing the Agent/Connect permission for agent launch URLs.
