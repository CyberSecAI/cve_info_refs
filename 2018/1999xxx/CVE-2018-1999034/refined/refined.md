{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Inedo ProGet Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation, which could expose the Jenkins controller to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
     "The plugin applied this setting globally to the entire JVM"
    ],
    "impact": "Disabling SSL/TLS validation can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially allowing attackers to intercept or modify data in transit. This could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communications between Jenkins and other systems.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks where a man-in-the-middle can intercept communications.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker positioned on the network path between the Jenkins controller and other systems it communicates with."
