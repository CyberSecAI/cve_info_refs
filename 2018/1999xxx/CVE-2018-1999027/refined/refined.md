Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1999027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SaltStack Plugin for Jenkins did not perform proper permission checks on methods that implemented form validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing permission checks:** Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could access form validation methods that should have required Overall/Administer access.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The affected form validation methods did not require POST requests. This allowed attackers to initiate actions by tricking a user into loading a crafted URL or form that submits the requests on their behalf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers could connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could cause Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker exploits the lack of permission checks and the CSRF vulnerability by crafting malicious requests to the affected API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker would need to obtain valid credential IDs through some other means. This could possibly be achieved through prior access, or through exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to entice a Jenkins user to execute a malicious crafted URL or form.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the SaltStack Plugin for Jenkins.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by enforcing POST requests for the validation methods and requiring Overall/Administer permissions to access them.
*   The plugin version 3.1.6 and earlier is affected by this vulnerability, with version 3.1.7 being the fix.
