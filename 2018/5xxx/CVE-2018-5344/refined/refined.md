{
  "CVE-2018-5344": {
    "description": "A race condition existed in loop block device implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient serialization in the `lo_release()` function of the loop block device driver, leading to a race condition.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with permissions to set up loopback disks.",
       "additional_notes": [
         "The vulnerability exists in the `drivers/block/loop.c` file.",
          "The fix introduces a lock to prevent concurrent `lo_open` and `lo_release` operations."
