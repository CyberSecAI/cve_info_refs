- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization/validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database, data modification, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the login form of the web application. Specifically, the 'User' field is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application. They don't need to be authenticated.
