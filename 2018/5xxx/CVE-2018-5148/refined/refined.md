  "CVE-2018-5148": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in the compositor during certain graphics operations when a raw pointer is used instead of a reference counted one. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in the compositor where a raw pointer is used instead of a reference-counted pointer, leading to a dangling pointer. The compositor was using a raw pointer to a GL context, which could be freed while still referenced by the compositor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability",
      "Incorrect pointer handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control of the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted website",
      "Graphics operations within the browser"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted website designed to trigger this use-after-free.",

        "Red Hat Errata RHSA-2018:1099",
        "Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3609-1"
    ],
	"details": "The vulnerability occurs within the graphics compositing layer of Firefox. Specifically, a raw pointer to the GL context is held in CompositingRenderTargetOGL, while the actual GL context may have been freed if the TextureImageTextureSourceOGL, which used a reference-counted pointer to GL Context is destroyed first, leading to a use-after-free condition when the compositor later tries to dereference the freed memory region.\n The fix involves replacing the raw pointer with a RefPtr (reference counted pointer) to manage the lifecycle of the GL context, ensuring that the GL context is valid when accessed.",
      "additional_notes": [
      "The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.",
        "The patch involves replacing a raw pointer with a reference-counted pointer.",
	"The fix was backported to older Firefox ESR versions.",
        "Red Hat severity rating for this issue is Important."
