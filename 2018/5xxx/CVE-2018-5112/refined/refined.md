Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5112:

**CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the failure to enforce the requirement that development tools panels within extensions must load URLs relative to the extension's manifest file. The `browser.devtools.panels.create` API was not properly validating the provided `pagePath` argument.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The `devtools.panels.create` API was accepting arbitrary URLs, including non-relative ones and privileged `about:` URLs.
    *   **Lack of Enforcement:** The browser failed to enforce the constraint that panel URLs must be relative to the extension's manifest, allowing non-relative URLs to be loaded. This bypassed intended security mechanisms.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By loading non-relative URLs, particularly privileged `about:` pages, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to privileged browser functionalities or data.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability could be potentially exploited to execute arbitrary code, by loading a malicious page through a non-relative URL.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Extension:** An attacker could create a malicious WebExtension designed to exploit this vulnerability, which could be installed by a user.
    *   **Exploiting Existing Extensions:** A vulnerable extension could be modified to load non-relative URLs, either through a compromised extension update or malicious user modifications.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious extension or modify a vulnerable extension.
    *   The victim must install or enable this malicious or modified extension.
    *   The developer tools panel must be opened to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The vulnerability was fixed by enforcing the use of `ExtensionURL` type in the API schema, which validates that URLs used in `devtools.panels.create` are relative URLs.

* **Additional Details:**
   * The provided bugzilla entry provides a detailed discussion of the issue, including the proposed solutions, reviews of patches, and the security implications.
   *  The initial patch replaced the type used in the `devtools.panels.create` API schema from `string` to `manifest.ExtensionURL`. This forces the schema wrapper to raise an error if the string is not a relative URL. This was later updated to properly handle empty strings for the `iconPath` property.
    * The fix was implemented in Firefox 58, as detailed in the provided Mozilla Security Advisory.
    *  The issue was categorized as a security-moderate issue.
    *  The fix was verified by QA on multiple operating systems to ensure it properly addressed the vulnerability without breaking existing functionality of devtools extensions.

In summary, CVE-2018-5112 highlights a vulnerability where improper URL handling within WebExtension developer tools could lead to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution. The fix implemented proper URL validation and enforcement to resolve the issue.
