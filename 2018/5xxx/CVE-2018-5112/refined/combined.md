* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

##### References

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Steps to reproduce:
PoC attached.
1. Unpack attached PoC addon
2. Go to about:debugging and temporarily load the unpacked addon
3. Open web console and navigate to 'My Panel'
Actual results:
We can load non-relative URLs including privileged about: urls
Expected results:
According to <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools.panels/create>
"The URL should be relative to the manifest.json file itself"
Also, as per [Bug 1380597](/show_bug.cgi?id=1380597 "RESOLVED FIXED - sidebarAction.setPopup is missing a URL security check") this is breaking security measures.

Shane, can you take a look?
Separately, Andy, maybe we need a separate bug to audit entrypoints that take paths/urls for this type of problem? And/or some kind of more systemic check in place for this stuff, so we don't run into it again and again as we add more APIs?

Maybe use ImageDataOrExtensionURL?
Are we also going to check in the api if the url can be accessed?

Attached patch

[1-Bug\_1425224\_\_\_Use\_manifest\_ExtensionURL\_in\_devtools\_panels\_create\_API\_schema\_.patch](attachment.cgi?id=8938412&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8938412&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1425224&attachment=8938412)

I've added a new test case and changed the type of the icon url used in the schema file,
the reason is that for devtools.panels.create also supports an empty string as the icon url and in that case the default extension icon has to be used for the panel.
The devtools.panels.create API method doesn't seem to support an icon passed as image data (also in the Chrome docs they only mention that it should be a relative url, to be fair they don't mention the empty string behavior, but I've seen an empty string used in some of the devtools extension, e.g. react devtools, and so we supported this undocumented behavior as it is supported on Chrome and used by existent extensions).
I also tested locally some of the most used devtools addons (e.g. React DevTools, Redux DevTools, Ember Inspector and VueJS DevTools) to double check that they doesn't break with the patch applied.
An alternative approach (which I would even prefer to the approach used in this patch) would be to define an additional format in Schemas.jsm, but I've currently preferred this one mostly because it seems easier to uplift on different releases because it doesn't touch webextensions internals that could have changes in the meantime.

Small fix on the last version of this patch (the new version only needs the changes applied in the schema file and the new test case).
The additional details from [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL") are all still valid for this version of the patch.

1-Bug\_1425224\_\_\_Use\_manifest\_ExtensionURL\_in\_devtools\_panels\_create\_API\_schema\_\_r\_mixedpuppy.patch
[Security approval request comment]
## How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
## Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The new tests is what more clearly shows which are the panel urls that
used to be loadable in the extension devtools panel and are now rejected as invalid.
Nevertheless, loading this URLs in the panel doesn't seem to give to the extension code any direct access to the window global related to the loaded URL (because the panel onShown event is never been sent for a non-extension page loaded in the panel, and this event is the only way that the extension can use to get access to the window global for the created extension panel), and so the extensions
that is trying to exploit the issue shouldn't be able to do anything more
(besides being able to load in the devtools panel URLs that they are not, and shouldn't be, able to load anywhere).
## Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
The related feature is support on Firefox >= 54 (which is the version in which this API has been landed) and so the affected branches should be:
- mozilla-central
- mozilla-beta
- mozilla-release
## If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
[Bug 1300587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1300587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implements devtools_panel context and devtools.panel.create API method")
## Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
The attached patch should be able to be imported on the older branches listed above without further changes.
(the changes on the JSON schema file should be able to apply without any conflicts, while the tests could meet some minor conflicts, but the new test cases is in its isolated test function and so I don't expect any complex conflicts).
## How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Very unlikely:
The behavior expected by the existent addons that are using this API as expected (with valid URLs relative to the extension base URI) is unmodified by this patch, and so non-malicious extensions should not notice any change or regression.
The change can only affects the devtools.panels API namespace, the devtools.panels.create API method in particular, and so only extensions that are creating a devtools panel can regress.
It can be tested explicitly using the following STR (the same that I used to verify the patch locally on mozilla-central):
- Install one or more of the following extensions:
AdBlock Plus, React DevTools, Redux DevTools, Ember Inspector, VueJS DevTools
- load a webpage in a new tab
(for same tool is better to choose a page that uses the JS framework related
to the devtools panel, because the extension will not create the panel otherwise,
e.g. searching from "<framework\_name> todo mvc" is usually enough to find a
webpage to test the extension on)
- open the developer tools on the new tab
- verify that the icon related to the extension panel is visible as expected
- select the extension devtools panel and verify that it is loaded as expected

As qab noted, sec-approval not strictly necessary for sec-moderate bugs. If this were a more severe bug we'd minus this request and ask you to move the tests into a separate patch to be checked in after we released a fix (or even a separate bug if that would help you track it better).
Since it's moderate it's fine.

Thanks a lot for these additional details, it was my first sec-approval,
and these details are be very helpful to me, so that I can use
the right workflow upfront when preparing this kind of patches.

1-Bug\_1425224\_\_\_Use\_manifest\_ExtensionURL\_in\_devtools\_panels\_create\_API\_schema\_\_r\_mixedpuppy.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [Bug 1300587](/show_bug.cgi?id=1300587 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implements devtools_panel context and devtools.panel.create API method") (which has introduced support for the devtools.panels.create API method in Firefox >= 54)
[User impact if declined]: An extension may open in a devtools panel some non-"moz-extension://" urls (the list of the urls that are actually able to load in the panel varies based on the process where the extension pages are loaded, e.g. about:addons only loads successfully if the extension pages are running in the main process).
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Yes, see [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL") for the STR, it would be also reasonable to test manually some of the common devtools addons from AMO (e.g. React/Redux DevTools, VueJS DevTools and Ember Inspector) to double-check that the fixes are not introducing any regression that breaks the existent devtools extensions).
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: No
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The allowed panel urls and icon urls are limited using the API JSON schema file, no new code has been added (besides the additional test case).
[String changes made/needed]: None

I reproduced this issue on a build before 04.Jan.2018, "My Panel" tab is displayed in "Web Console", once I click on any of the "about: " links nothing happened and sometimes the tab content turns white.
But on a build after 04.Jan.2018 after I temporarily load the unpacked addon in "about:debugging", "My Panel" tab isn't displayed in "Web Console".
Is there any other way that I could verify this bug on the latest nightly?
Thanks.

The tab content turns white when the particular about page is not loadable in the particular process where the extension is running (and this is an expected behavior of the unfixed version when the extension is running in the extension process, as also briefly described in [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL")).
The test described in [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c19 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL") is enough to test that the fix is in place, we should test it explicitly for both remote (which is the default on Windows systems) and non-remote webextension modes (which is the default on Linux and OSX systems).
It is also worth to make the opposite test (regular devtools extension should not break with the fix in place) as described in [Comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL"):
- installing some of the common devtools extensions from AMO (e.g. React/Redux DevTools, VueJS DevTools and Ember Inspector),
- load a webpage that can be inspected with the target extension (this step is needed because some of these addons do not create the panel for webpages that cannot be inspected with the particular extension):
- React DevTools => <http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/>
- Redux DevTools => <https://zalmoxisus.github.io/examples/todomvc/>
- VueJS DevTools => <http://todomvc.com/examples/vue/>
- Ember Inspector => <http://todomvc.com/examples/emberjs/>
- open the developer tools and double-check that they are behaving as on a "non fixed Firefox version", e.g.:
- the panel icon is the expected one
- the extension panel is loaded as expected once it is selected

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8945439&action=edit)

I reproduced this issue on Nightly 59.0a1(2017-12-14) under Windows 10 x64 using the steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL").
I retested the issue, by taking in consideration the informations from [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser.devtools.panels.create does not ensure panel pagePath is relative URL"), on Beta 59.0b3 under Windows 10 x64, Ubuntu 16.04 x64 and macOS x10.13 with the following results:
1. After I temporary loaded the unpacked addon in about:debugging, the "My Panel" tab is not displayed in "Web Console".
2. After I installed some of the common devtools extensions (React Developer Tools, Redux DevTools, VueJS DevTools and Ember Inspector), loaded the webpage that can be inspected with the target extension, the panel icons corresponded with the expected ones (for Redux DevTools and VueJS DevTools) and the extension panel was loaded as expected once it was selected.
Note: It is pretty obvious that the panel icons correspond also for React Developer Tools and Ember Inspector. But I am not sure if it's expected for these addons' icons to not be similar in every location: React Developer Tools (AMO, about:addons page, Web console vs awesome bar) and for the Ember Inspector (AMO, about:addons page vs Web Console) (see attachment).Flags: needinfo?(lgreco)

Yes: those extensions are explicitly using a different icon for the extension listed in "about:addons", the browserAction and/or devtools panel and so the different icons are part of the expected behavior.Flags: needinfo?(lgreco)

No. All of Mozilla is in conference this week, and will be (and traveling) until the begining of next week, so that impacts people being available to work/triage this.
From a quick look, this doesn't look like a complete spoof (security info (lock) isn't changed) and so this is sec-moderate or lower, so it isn't a "drop everything and fix this" kind of bug.
I also believe other patches I have in flight already might address this bug, but due to the above I just haven't had cycles to check that.

This is no longer broken on today's nightly. I suspect my belief was right and that my fix for [bug 791597](/show_bug.cgi?id=791597 "VERIFIED FIXED - Dragging and dropping URLs leads to address bar spoofing") fixed it. I think I'd like to poke at this more though, feels like we should do more checks on the URI before even attempting to load it (and put it in the URL bar).Blocks: [CVE-2017-5417](/show_bug.cgi?id=791597 "VERIFIED FIXED - Dragging and dropping URLs leads to address bar spoofing")

Any updates will appear in the bug. This is still on my list, but I'm on holiday right now. I don't believe this is critical - your testcase requires substantial user action and does not spoof the lock icon (so it's not a complete URL bar spoof). In that sense it's even less severe than 791597, which was sec-moderate.
The testcase doesn't currently work at all on Nightly, but I'm not sure if that will still be the case after I fix [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area"). I don't have time to test this right now (as I said, I'm on holiday). I'll look at it again after I get back, update the patch there and get it to land.

I was right in my suspicion that fixing [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area") will make nightly vulnerable again.
I see several avenues we could pursue to fix this:
1) break all dragging to the URL bar. This is what Edge does. (I don't think this is a good idea. Something about the baby and the bathwater.)
2) break dragging plaintext to the URL bar. This is what IE does.
3) always search for non-URL drops. This is what Chrome does.
4) attempt to build some kind of heuristic to determine whether this is an attempt to spoof the user.
I don't think (4) is likely to work. There will always be more ways (specifically, more unicode characters) to spoof things than we can try to work around, and so I'm not particularly interested in trying. We do need to continue to support unicode typing and dragging to the URL bar for people who don't live in the English or other latin-charset-based languages, so I think that's a losing battle.
I would like to propose (3), with fallback to (2) if the user has toggled the hidden keyword.enabled pref, and while simultaneously improving our url fixup (e.g. [bug 1181081](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181081 "RESOLVED FIXED - urifixup service should correct \"http//\" or \"https//\" or \"http;//\" etc. to insert/replace the colon")) and using it explicitly in the dnd code, to mitigate cases where people "almost" drag a URL to the URL bar, like just dragging "google.com" or "/google.com" etc.
This is a change in UX, so I would like some buy-in from the UX team as well as Marco (with whom I've discussed this before now...) before working on this.
Philipp, the TL;DR here is that dragging arbitrary text to the URL bar and leaving it there is perceived to be a spoofing risk, especially because the user can't always control what the text is (websites can manipulate this). While Marco and I have discussed alternative solutions like showing the current page's URL when the URL bar is not focused (rather than the user's last input), that would likely be confusing and potentially break particular usage scenarios (drag text, then type) and/or not really fix the spoofing risk if users don't re-check the URL bar after re-focusing the content. So I listed some avenues above that we could explore. As noted, I would lean towards (3) unless you have strong objections.

Yep, we need to fixup the text, it would be sad to drop "www.mozilla.org" and run a search cause it's not a complete url.
Chrome is doing something similar, as I previously said, any text is automatically searched, unless it "looks like" a url, then it is fixed up and visited. I don't think there's any situation where they allow you to drop something in the urlbar and it stays there to be further edited. And in spite of this report, it makes sense as a behavior.
The only 2 problems I see:
1. UX change. User can't drag&drop a text, modify it to his likes and THEN start a search or a visit. This feature gets lost. On the other side, it sounds like an edge case, so we could just decide to take the hit.
2. D&D won't have the same behavior as C&P. IIRC we previously discussed this and there was some hint that we don't consider these 2 operations the same, in terms of spoof, cause C&P requires 2 actions and you see what you are copying (unless the web page populates the clipboard for you!). Before implementing a fix very specific to D&D, we should evaluate how much we care about C&P case, if we care a lot, maybe we need a broader approach? That said, if the patch here ends up being "simple" enough, we could take it regardless as a step forward.Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

Copy and paste is also more useful (in the location bar) right now than DND is. I paste things without wanting to use "paste and go" immediately, and then edit, also because paste gives you control over the insertion point, which we don't do for DND (even though on some OSes we'll show a cursor in the middle of the text while dragging :-\ ).

I pointed out in [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL bar spoof using drag and drop (dnd) and unicode-lookalike protocol to drag plaintext that \"looks like\" a valid URL") that fixing [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area") would re-break Nightly. As you can see in bugzilla, I fixed [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area"), so this is no longer 'fixed' in Nightly - dragging text to the location bar was just buggy in Nightly for a time, which also 'fixed' this bug as long as it was broken.

Mario, this is a sec-moderate issue. It isn't an emergency and devs will work on moderate issues as they can to get them fixed. You don't need to ask "is this going to be fixed?" That's a bit insulting.

Mario,
Bugzilla shouldn't be used in place of email. If you have questions, as has been said before, please email security@mozilla.org and leave the bug for discussions of patches or technical questions or requests. For the hundredth time, please quit asking for "Is there an update" or similar \*in the bugs\*. If the devs have an update, it will show up here. There is nowhere else for it to appear. If there are no updates here, then there are no updates. All general questions should be sent to us in email, not added to the bug (over and over).
> it's complicated working with you guys, everything that I say results in
> complains. What's the deal?
This is because people find your behavior to often be rude.
> I ask for updates because it seems like the bugs
> has been forgotten even thought it's sec-moderate it's still a bug and is

Bugs aren't forgotten. We have regular reports of unfixed security bugs. We are aware that they exist. Sec-critical bugs get the highest priority, followed by sec-high bugs. Sec-moderates are fixed as makes sense but they don't necessarily override the priority of other, ongoing, work, and are not considered emergencies.
> everything that it's asked seems to be "insulting", didn't know mozilla was
> \*that\* sensitive.
It is because of both how you ask and the fact that on just about every bug that you report, you wind up engaging in this behavior. We do notice these things and it becomes tiresome. You've literally interacted with Mozilla for \*years\* so you should know how our processes work and what we've asked you to do or not do in the past.

[The patch](attachment.cgi?id=8925542&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8925542&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1321619&attachment=8925542)

This executes the default action associated with the text that was dropped on the location bar, which is usually a search. If the "keyword.enabled" preference is false in about:config, this will perform a navigation, rather than disallowing the drop. This is because this preference is hidden, so I went with the simplest approach. I also haven't written an explicit test case for it.
I'll land this patch with the bug number once it's reviewed. I've started a tryserver build here:

Testing the Try build, it seems to be doing exactly what we expect, search or load url on drop. I'd like this to land asap, so we have about one full week of Nightly testing.

nit: maybe name it promiseLoad? in one case it's not a search
