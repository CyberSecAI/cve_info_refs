Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-5091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs during WebRTC connections when interacting with the DTMF timers. Specifically, the issue lies within the `PeerConnectionImpl::DTMFSendTimerCallback_m()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** A pointer to a DTMF state object stored within the `mDTMFStates` array is used after it has been freed. This happens when the timer callback function is invoked after the associated state object has been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The use-after-free leads to a crash, which could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The provided crash reports and exploit PoC show an access violation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the EIP register (as demonstrated in comment #4).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebRTC Connections:** The vulnerability is triggered through the WebRTC API, specifically when manipulating DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) functionality, which is commonly used for sending tones over a phone call.
*   **Specially Crafted Website/Code:** An attacker could create a malicious web page that uses JavaScript to trigger the vulnerable code path in Firefox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this remotely through a crafted website that the victim would have to visit using the vulnerable browser, though user interaction may be required depending on specific exploit details.
*   **Knowledge of WebRTC and DTMF APIs:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how to manipulate the WebRTC API to send DTMF signals in a way that triggers the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability involves `PeerConnectionImpl::DTMFSendTimerCallback_m` function being called after the `DTMFState` object, which it expects to be valid, has been freed. The `DTMFState` objects are stored in the `mDTMFStates` vector.
*   The fix involves using `nsITimerCallback` instead of a raw closure, and storing the `DTMFState` with a `UniquePtr` to ensure the object's validity through its lifetime. Backports are created for older ESR versions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug was reported by Looben Yang.
*   The exploit PoC in comment #4 demonstrates the possibility of EIP control.
*   The fix was implemented and verified, and backported to affected Firefox ESR versions.
*   Red Hat also addressed this issue in their products, as described in RHSA-2018:0122.
*   The issue was present in the code since DTMF support was introduced in [bug 1291715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1291715).

In summary, CVE-2018-5091 describes a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox's WebRTC implementation that allows an attacker to cause a potentially exploitable crash by manipulating DTMF functionalities from a remote web page. The fix addresses this through an API change and memory management improvements.
