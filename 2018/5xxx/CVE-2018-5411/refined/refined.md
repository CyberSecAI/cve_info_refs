- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the node note field of Pixar's Tractor software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the node note field, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the note field. When other users view the node information, the injected script will execute in their browsers. This can lead to various attacks, such as website redirects, session cookie hijacking, social engineering, and potentially other impacts that could compromise the user's system or data.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can inject JavaScript code into the "note" field associated with a node. The attack is triggered when another user views this node's information, causing the injected script to execute in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Pixar Tractor software to be able to add notes to existing nodes.
