## Pixar Tractor contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#756913

Original Release Date: 2018-12-13 | Last Revised: 2019-01-28

---

### Overview

Pixar's Tractor network rendering software is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

### Description

| Pixar's Tractor software, versions 2.2 and earlier, contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)) in the field that allows a user to add a note to an existing node. The stored information is displayed when a user requests information about the node. An attacker could insert JavaScript into this note field that is then saved and displayed to the end user. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker might include JavaScript that could execute on an authenticated user's system, which could lead to website redirects, session cookie hijacking, social engineering, and other impacts. Since the attacker's script is stored with the information about the node, all other users with access to this data are also vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Pixar has released an updated version of this software that addresses this vulnerability, Tractor version 2.3 (build 1923604). Affected users should update to this version. |
