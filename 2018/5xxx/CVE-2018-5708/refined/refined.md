Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the D-Link DIR-601 router's firmware exposing the administrator's username and password in cleartext within the XML response of the `restore_default` configuration file. This occurs due to a lack of proper authentication and access control on this specific configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The most significant vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive administrative credentials (username and password) in cleartext within the router's configuration file.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `restore_default` configuration file can be accessed without prior authentication, allowing an attacker on the local network to retrieve it.
*   **Poor Credential Management:** Storing and transmitting the admin password in cleartext is a poor security practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Router Compromise:** An attacker who successfully obtains the administrator's credentials can gain full access to the router's configuration panel.
*   **Network Control:** With administrative access, an attacker can modify router settings, redirect traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and potentially compromise other devices on the network.
*   **Data Exposure:** Depending on the configuration and connected devices, the attacker might be able to access personal or sensitive data.
*   **Botnet Recruitment:** Compromised routers can be used as part of a botnet for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable D-Link DIR-601 router.
*   **Unauthenticated Request:** The attacker can access the vulnerable configuration file through HTTP requests without requiring prior login or authentication to the router's admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable D-Link DIR-601 router.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the router (e.g. using a web browser or a tool like Burp Suite).
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects D-Link DIR-601 B1 2.02NA devices.
*   D-Link has confirmed the vulnerability but will not provide patches for the affected device, as it is past its service life.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Kevin Randall.
*   A detailed proof of concept (PoC) is available, outlining the steps to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable configuration is available at `http://<router_ip>/my_cgi.cgi?request=auth&request=load_settings&table_name=restore_default`. The admin credentials can be found within the XML response under the `<admin_user>` tag.
