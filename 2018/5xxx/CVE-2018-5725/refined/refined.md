Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-5725:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Master IP CAM 01 device allows unauthenticated configuration changes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Configuration Change:** The device does not require authentication to modify its configuration via the `/web/cgi-bin/hi3510/param.cgi` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the device's configuration without requiring any credentials.
- The example provided shows how to change the HTTP port to 8080, but other configuration options are also available using the `param.cgi` endpoint.
- An attacker could make the device unreachable, change passwords, or otherwise disrupt normal functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network access:** An attacker only needs network access to the device (e.g., the local network) to exploit this vulnerability.
- **HTTP requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered using HTTP requests to the vulnerable `param.cgi` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- No specific technical skills are mentioned other than the ability to craft an HTTP request.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides examples of how to trigger the vulnerability.
- A link to a PDF document containing available commands is provided, suggesting that a wide variety of configuration options may be vulnerable.
