Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `libvorbis` library's codebook parsing code. Specifically, an out-of-bounds write can occur when processing Vorbis audio data.
- The issue arises in the `vorbis_book_decodev_add` function (and other similar decode functions), which has a flaw in its loop control logic, potentially writing outside the allocated buffer.
- This is caused by a missing bounds check when adding decoded values to a buffer, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue where the code attempts to write beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.
- **Integer overflow (indirect):** While not directly an integer overflow, this vulnerability is caused by not properly checking the size of the buffer when performing multiplication or addition operations during decoding, which can lead to reading from arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to write arbitrary data into memory. This can be used to overwrite code or pointers, leading to arbitrary code execution in the application's context.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A less severe outcome is that a specially crafted audio file could cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The out-of-bounds write can corrupt heap memory, potentially causing other issues in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Audio File:** The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted Vorbis audio file.
- **Website:** The vulnerability is exploitable through websites that play audio or load Vorbis data.
- **Network:** A network-based attack is possible if the application is used to load Vorbis data over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to serve crafted OGG files:** The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted OGG file containing malformed Vorbis audio data.
- **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the crafted content, usually by visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious audio file.
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered during the Pwn2Own contest.
- libtremor which is used on some architectures for decoding vorbis is vulnerable too.
- There are similar bugs in `libvorbis` that needed to be addressed alongside this one.
- Mozilla's fix involves a vector bounds guard in `vorbis_book_decodev_add` and other cases.
- Red Hat's advisory mentions the issue might lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Patches were made available in firefox 59.0.1, firefox ESR 52.7.2. and Thunderbird 52.7
