{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `pdf_parse_array` function in `pdf/pdf-parse.c` enters an infinite loop if a crafted PDF file does not contain a `PDF_TOK_CLOSE_ARRAY` token, because the loop only terminates on this token but not on `PDF_TOK_EOF`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability due to missing EOF check in PDF array parsing logic."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, application hang.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By processing a crafted PDF file."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted PDF file.",
    "affected_versions": "MuPDF versions prior to the commit `b70eb93f6936c03d8af52040bbca4d4a7db39079` (fixed in version 1.13.0)."
  },
  "extra_details": {
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located in the `pdf_parse_array` function in `source/pdf/pdf-parse.c`. The fix involves adding a check for the `PDF_TOK_EOF` token to break the parsing loop.",
    "vulnerable_code_details": "The while loop within the `pdf_parse_array` function terminates only upon encountering `PDF_TOK_CLOSE_ARRAY`, leading to infinite loop if the crafted PDF does not contain this token.",
    "poc_available": "A proof-of-concept PDF file is available at: `https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer/poc/blob/master/mupdf/mupdf_1-12-0_mutool_infinite-loop_pdf_parse_array.pdf`."
