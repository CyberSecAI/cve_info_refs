{
  "CVE-2018-5116": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CveID": "CVE-2018-5116",
      "CveDescription": "WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission."
    },
    "TechnicalDetails": {
      "RootCause": "The ActiveTab permission in Firefox WebExtensions incorrectly allowed access to cross-origin frames within a tab, even if the frames were not part of the original page content.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "Impact": "A malicious extension with the ActiveTab permission can inject arbitrary code into any frame within the active tab, including cross-origin iframes, leading to potential data theft, request forgery, or other malicious actions.",
      "AttackVectors": [
        "A malicious extension injects code into a tab.",
        "The injected code creates a hidden iframe to an arbitrary domain.",
         "Code is then injected into that iframe, leading to XSS."
      ],
      "AttackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious WebExtension and convince the user to install it. The extension needs only the 'activeTab' permission.",
      "AffectedProduct": "Firefox WebExtensions"
    },
        "AdditionalInformation": {
            "details": "The fix involves restricting script injection using activeTab permission to only frames that were part of the original HTML of the page or are same-origin, but not frames created by scripts after the page has loaded. This aligns Firefox with Chrome's behavior and provides a more secure model for the activeTab permission.",
             "relatedBugs": [
