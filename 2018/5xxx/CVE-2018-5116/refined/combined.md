+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1408138](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408138 "NEW") +++
In [bug 1408183 comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408183#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Backfill sync bookmark validation from sync_summary_v2") through [bug 1408183 comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408183#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - Backfill sync bookmark validation from sync_summary_v2") Jerry describes a related but different problem. Nothing to do with 'Mixed Content', but the fact that background connections (in that example something to do with the OpenH264 plugin handling media server requests) can pop HTTP Auth. They have to go somewhere so we stick them in the currently active page. They don't get the "WARNING this isn't the top-level site" text we give for sub-resource auth because it's disconnected from the page.
Problem compounded in that case because they were http: requests and could be hijacked locally to trigger auth. The real solution would be to ignore HTTP Auth on background requests not associated with a page.

I think toplevelouterwindowid would be 0 in that case (chrome initiated). Note that a toplevel load in a new tab will not have this window id as well - there is no content window for it yet.

no, xhr invoked from a content script will have the correct window (coming from the load context).Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

TriggeringPrincipal == SystemPrincipal is your best bet to figure out if the load is initiated by chrome. Different question, this is only about background loads, doesn't the flag LOAD\_BACKGROUND help to figure out if a channel loads in the background?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I am not sure if LOAD\_BACKGROUND is set for that case at all. It is usually set on resources on a page that should not count for onload events, e.g. xhr.

Are there any legitimate cases for an HTTP Auth ask (401 & 407) by a background connection? I can't recall ever running into this sort of design in any add-ons I've ever used.

From [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections"), this work (setting TriggeringPrincipal to SystemPrincipal for background request) is a work in progress. I just want to know what are the errors if I only check for TriggeringPrincipal == SystemPrincipal.

We fall back to systemPrincipal for triggeringPrincipal when we don't know what really initiated the load. There is a project to fix that that is in progress. Kate - do you have the list of open bugs for this? Dragana - we could show you where in the code we do this, but I don't think we know what situations cause this.Flags: needinfo?(kmckinley)

At the level we're working we probably don't know which loads are initiated by add-ons or not. Background requests with auth are problematic and we'd like to block them. We /tried/ blocking them all, but XHR requests were one that in practice are currently expected to work. If we can distinguish between "background" XHR requests that we can't--for now--break and the true background requests (not associated with any page content) such as the media server connections you found we certainly would want to block the latter.
In the screenshot we are not showing the "WARNING blah blah" text, so we \_know\_ it's not a 3rd party in-page request. In that case can we do a simple check that "if not '3rd party' then it damn well better match the 1st party" when we're about to attach it to a window?

> How many false positive we get if we use TriggeringPrincipal ==

Let me summarize:
(a) for all loads that are \*not\* of TYPE\_DOCUMENT, the triggeringPrincipal is always accurate and reflects the web content that triggered the load, or alternatively, if triggered by the system, then SystemPrincipal.
(b) for loads of TYPE\_DOCUMENT there is some uncertainty about the triggeringPrincipal (we are about to fix that within [Bug 1333030](/show_bug.cgi?id=1333030 "ASSIGNED - [meta] Assert nsDocShell::loadURIWithOptions receives a non null triggeringPrincipal") and dependents):
\* if it's a codebasePrincipal, then we definitely know the load was triggered by web content
\* if it's a systemPrincipal, then we are (my guess) 95% sure the load was triggered by the system
The reason for that uncertainty is that we have a fallback mechanism in place that helps us to generate a triggeringPrincipal if not passed explicitly, see:

>(and of course a completely separate question is why is OpenH264 replying to broadcast messages?)
It's part of the SSDP discovery process: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol> and I assume was implemented as part of the plugin support for H.264 streaming media. As an example, maybe a developer would want to integrate with the Silicon Dust HDHomeRun solution within the browser. In fact I think this might be an actual thing that PLEX supports.

I think this is not accurately diagnose now because we do not have windowId that early in some cases, e.g. opening in a new tab.

Thanks.
I really did not expect that I am going to break our own tests :)
I need to take a look if we do the authentication that we want to forbid or is triggeringPrincipal wrong and set to systemPrincipal.

Yes, there is a stupid test failure that I still do not understand. I will try to fix it in next days. '--verify' mochitest is failing if I only add a empty line, really an empty line, to browser/components/originattributes/test/browser/browser\_httpauth.js - very strange. I need to change the test to make it work with this patch, i.e. i need to change the pref introduce here at the beginning of that test.
I will need to take a close look at IsolationTestTools and probably rewrite it. Sorry for the delay.

The test failure that I have described in [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c32 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections") has just disappeared. It most have been triggered by something completely different. I have spend so much time trying to figure it out.
Anyway, now everything works fine.

This test was added recently. It was not there before. Anyway, since [bug 1423522](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423522 "RESOLVED FIXED - We should not block http-authentication prompts for proxies.") landed we do not need to change this test, so everything is green.

Re: 1425307, 1425386. Luckily there's a solution: either use HTTP for the main site, or switch to using HTTPS for sub-sites and all sub-site resources. Bad practices on the part of a few solutions should never endanger the wider Internet. I've been drafting a short statement on this bug but was waiting for Apple to finish some of their patching before publishing. Maybe it's time to publicly address the flaw which includes suggested guidance? I'm happy to put something together / coordinate with your communications team. I understand this change is likely to cause issues for some, but given the severity to everyone else, I think the steps taken were appropriate.

bug\_1409449\_beta.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: It is not a regression the code exists for a very long time.
[User impact if declined]:This bug disallow a http authentication dialog to be triggered by the non-web content. It can be used for phishing.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: no
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: [bug 1425156](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425156 "VERIFIED FIXED - regression: HTTP Basic Auth dialog won't appear") and also patch bug\_1409449\_tests\_beta.patch from this bug.
[Is the change risky?]: low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: the code change is not risky. triggeringPrincipal is not set always set properly, in most of the cases it is, but I am not the right person to make statement on this. According to [comment 48](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c48 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections") it is a safe to uplift.

We don't "need" to, but since it's blocking an abuse technique that's actively being used against our users in bad ads it would be very nice to take. The guts of the patch are actually quite simple, and it's got tons of telemetry and adds a pref so we can easily flip off the change if we have to.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208324>
Related, they've also released information on [CVE-2017-7164](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7164) related to similar vulnerabilities in the App Store:
<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208334>
Each of these CVE's also applies to a number of other Apple platforms which they've further acknowledged.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053622
Steps to reproduce:
The ActiveTab permission allows an extension to only access the current tab (after the user interacted with the extension). This is to allow "extensions to fulfill a common use case, without having to give them very powerful permissions" like <all\_urls> (quote from the documentation).
However, it was found that this permission also allows access to frames within the tab that can be of a different domain. This allows a malicious extension, that requested only a very strict permission set, to still interact with any domain:
1. The extension injects code into the tab that creates a hidden iframe to an arbitrary domain.
2. The extension then injects code into that frame creating an XSS situation. This obviously allows for many kinds of nefarious actions such as theft of information, request forgery etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To recreate:
1. Inject code that creates a hidden iframe
2. Wait for the frame to load
3. inject any script into that frame
I provide a POC extension that shows a browser action (button). When clicked, a hidden iframe to "<https://example.com>" is created in the current tab and the cookies for that URL are console.log()ed.
The extension only requests activeTab yet this works regardless of the URL of the active tab.
Actual results:
The malicious code runs in all the frames in the current tab, including the iframe that was just created.
Expected results:
The activeTab should allow access to the parent frame only, and not to any inner frames. This is the behaviour in the Chrome browser.

So what you are saying is that you expect 'activeTab' to only grant a permission to the origin of the top level frame? What happens if the page actually contains cross-domain iframes? The add-on can not interact with them? That's not very intuitive to me, but its interesting if that is the way chrome has implemented it. Our model might have been a deliberate design decision, I dont know.
(NB We haven't documented this behavior either way; I know this as I am currently writing the security model documentation at the moment for Firefox's implementation of browser extensions).
Kris, Andrew - what do you think about this? Firstly is this something we would like to change? On one hand I think it makes the security model more consistent (i.e. you explicitly need the host permission to in order to executeScript in a frame) but the flipside is that might break extensions which rely on the currently behavior (and it might also result in all extensions requesting the <all\_urls> permission. I tend to agree with the reporter here though - while activeTab isn't quite as permissive as <all\_urls>
If we are going to change this, then I assume we would also need to change the behavior of the tabs and activeTab APIs, to grant a permission to the current frame. (and then I wonder, would that be scoped to the actual page or the origin, ie can you inject script into same origin iframes with different URLs. Origin would probably make the most sense).
If we DON'T want to make this change, then we should at least ensure that AMO and reviewers treat tab & activeTab with the same level of caution. (in line with <all\_urls> )
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
This seems like an important incompatibility with chrome if the behavior is as described - if we didn't do this deliberately, its probably something we want to address.

This behavior is intentional, yes. If Chrome behaves differently, that's certainly not the way it was documented when we implemented this. If we were to implement different restrictions, we'd probably still want to allow access to sub-frames that are same-origin with the root.
That said, I'm not sure that restricting access to subframes is what we want. Unless perhaps we only include subframes that were already present when the activeTab permission was granted.
But, really, any domain that's worth trying to hijack this way should set appropriate X-Frame-Options headers to prevent it being loaded in a subframe to begin with.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Honestly the documentation is all over the shop on this topic(both ours and theirs). But I think there is no point implementing restrictions if we allow subframes (there is no way to tell between legit sub-frames and injected sub-frames, right?). I'd agree with you x-frame-options, except that most sites don't set this even though they should.
From digging a little more into the chrome documentation, I don't think we are meeting the intention of the activeTab permission[1]. IIUC The design goals were to provide a permission which was NOT as dangerous as <all\_urls>, and hence they only allow scripting to the current page, until the page has been navigated. If don't restrict the sub-frame scripting then activeTab is as dangerous as <all\_urls> and in fact worse, since the implication isn't clear.
[1] <https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/activeTab#motivation>
And what our own documentation says is quoted above already ( "The intention of this permission is to enable extensions to fulfill a common use case, without having to give them very powerful permissions.")
Currently activeTab effectively as dangerous as <all\_urls>, just with the added restriction of requiring user interaction prior to execution. Of course, the other part of the story is that chrome doesn't show the activeTab permission to the user. Which seems deceptive to me. (I guess their assumption is that if the user is interacting with addon via a browser/page action, then this signals intent for the permission grant - and as such it would make sense to block sub-frames since the user cant be aware of the other origins that might be framed.)
So I actually think that we should 'fix' this, and block script execution in subframes, unless the extension has the correct permission.

I agree that it's confusing. Being called activeTab (and not activeTopFrameOfTab) it implies the entire tab. My own extension (Check4Change) would have wanted a "real" activeTab but would regrettably need to request <all\_urls> in order to access subframes in the current tab.
However, leaving this unfixed is too dangerous (IMO) as, like was said above, it is "effectively as dangerous as <all\_urls>" but without letting the user know.
One can overcome the X-Frame-Options restriction by loading URLs like these:
<https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png>
<https://www.facebook.com/ajax/bz>
The header doesn't mitigate the attack as it is intended to stop clickjacking and therefor only needed in the top-level pages (where there are actions to be done). It is not present (nor needs to be) in inner elements (in the examples about: The google logo, or a facebook ajax point). But of course an iframe can load an image and once it does it is within the Same-Origin of its domain, allowing execution of client side scripts.

We'll want to fix this (i.e., align it with Chrome) for various reasons. Security and web-extension compatibility.

Attached file
[PoC modified to work in both chrome and firefox](attachment.cgi?id=8905692)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8905692&action=edit)

This should work in both Chrome and Firefox.
STR:
1. Install addon as temporary addon
2. navigate to webpage that isnt exmaple.com (e.g. <https://misuse.co>)
3. press the browser action button installed by the extension
Results:
In chrome, one alert fires (for the top level domain)
In Firefox, two alerts fire (for both domains)

My 2c. I wonder why a malicious addon wouldn't just request the permissions it needs to access subframes anyway. Maybe a few less people will install, but they wouldn't have to deal with limitations.

Its a fair point and why it's a P2 and not a blocker in my opinion.
Legacy add-ons could of course just do all this with no prompting at all, but hey we should probably get the permissions matching expectations.

My 2c reply. One of the majors reasons moving away from legacy add-ons in the first place was security. The idea that add-ons couldn't just do anything they wanted anymore but rather had to ask for granular permissions and thus giving control back to the users to make an informed decision.
It's definitely arguable if this security mechanism (permissions) is broken by design because most users just click "ok" anyway (similar to Android). However it is still \*a\* security mechanism of the browser. It would be much simpler to do away with it entirely and just grant all permissions to all add-ons, but I assume no one would advocate for that as the simplicity doesn't outweigh the security benefits.
----------
I've noticed the bug was labeled "sec-moderate". It is my feeling that according to the guidelines (<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings>) the bug doesn't adhere to the description of "sec-moderate", yet fits well as "sec-high". From the doc "sec-high" allows "Obtaining confidential data from other sites the user is visiting, or inject data or code into those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions." (assuming installing an add-on is normal browsing actions).
Disclaimer: While I genuinely feel all the above is true, I wouldn't be arguing over semantics if I wasn't excited about the possibility of my bug achieving bug-bounty fame. :)

I probably agree with you there - would the less scary warning be worth it for a malicious add-on writer? I don't know, but it's clear we need to fix this as currently the activeTab permission doesn't fulfill the purpose of its existence.
The whole reason for the existence of "activeTab" permission is that its supposed to be a less dangerous permission, and that's the justification for why we \_show nothing\_ in the install permission prompt when a add-on has this permission. The idea with ActiveTab is that since the user has interacted with the tab (browser/page action, context menu etc) [1] then there is an implicit permission grant to interact with that page, if the extension has asked that it needs such permission.
So I thinks an important bug to fix, as currently our permission warnings (or lack of) are somewhat misleading imho.
(In reply to Ronen Zilberman from [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames"))
> My 2c reply....
Totally agree with you here that it needs to be fixed. Security is definitely a motivation for web extensions, but its more about removing the all-powerful nature of legacy extensions than actively trying to giving the user more control.
I do think however that sec-moderate is appropriate though both because the limited value this represents for attacker and inherent limitations of permission granting as a security control (i.e. users don't read prompts). Also activeTab requires user interaction in the form clicking a browser action, page action or context menu button.
Regardless of the rating, I do think this is worth bounty consideration, and I have flagged it as such. I've been explicitly testing our web extension implementation and I hadn't noticed this bug, so I'm a definitely very grateful here for the bug report here.

I did a little more testing on this in Chrome and empirically, it seems that Chrome distinguishes script-injected content and does not grant access to that content via activeTab. When this bug was originally filed, it wasn't feasible to implement that behavior in Firefox. But Kris, with your recent work on [bug 1406278](/show_bug.cgi?id=1406278 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use the subject principal as the triggering principal for loads of script-generated content") would it be feasible to do that now?Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Yeah, to some extent. Script-injected frames should have a triggeringPrincipal set for their src attribute (but not for their srcdoc attribute). But there are other ways to navigate a frame than setting its src property.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

So the rule can be: an extension can only use the activeTab permission to inject a script into a frame if the frame's current location matches its src attribute and its triggeringPrincipal is not an extension principal (or should this check be even more specific?)

The extension can set the src using the page's principal, and we don't currently record any principal for parser-created nodes. We need to actually record when the src was set using a non-script-created parser.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

When you say "script-injected" content - does that mean "any frames that were injected by a script (as opposed to declared in html)"? IE that if a webpage dynamically adds frames to itself with a script, Web Extensions will not have permission to inject into these with only the activetab permission?
Just making sure I understand this clearly (I should test this I suppose)

That sounds great to me. Again just to make sure I understand your goal here, the effective permission of activeTab permission would then to allow script injection into:
a) the top-level window of the current tab
b) Any iframes which are declared in the HTML of the document
I was expecting just (a), but if you would prefer (a)& (b) for compat reasons, that seems to make sense too. My goal here is to ensure that activeTab is significantly less privileged than <all\_urls>.Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

Yes, that is the proposal. We can't reliably distinguish script-injected frames that are created by the page itself from those created by an extension so its really the only safe thing to do.

Right a&b is what Chrome does and is what is proposed here.

I don't think this will work. It will just tell us the resolved URL of the current src attribute, but that could have changed since the frame was created.
I think we probably need to change the frame element code to clear the mNetworkCreated flag when the src/srcset attributes are changed, rather than when it's inserted into the document.

I don't think this is right. I think we probably want a `requireParserCreated` flag, or something, and to return false if it's not set, rather than ignoring the URL match patterns in the opposite case.

Actually, ignore this. Your way is better. If an extension has permissions for a
frame, it should always be able to inject into it. If it doesn't, we should fall
back to active tab permissions.

Still needs a test which is going to be tricky since all the apis that grant
the activeTab permission are browser- or mobile-specific. But for now here's
the patch to look at.

I think this should be something like `if (!succeeded || !equal) mHasNavigated = true`
Otherwise, it should be possible to reset the flag.
Also, we probably want to skip this if LOCATION\_CHANGE\_SAME\_DOCUMENT is set.

aInit is const, do you suggest making a copy? That seems like small overhead but totally unnecessary in most (hopefully all) cases.

Hm. Fair enough. Maybe just throw and return rather than asserting, then.

The more I think about this, the more I think we should also keep this check in `MatchesURI`, even if it is redundant. We don't currently call this function anywhere else, but we do expose it to JS, and it might lead to a future footgun.

Maybe just .sort() and use `Assert.deepEqual()` rather than checking the length and then doing two .include() checks? Would make it a bit clearer exactly what's going on...

Clarify rules for applying activeTab permission to content scripts
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Relatively easily by somebody who understands the code
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The tests are in a separate patch that can be landed separately. I've tried to avoid any comments in the code or the checkin summary that point toward the problem.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
I believe all supported branches (release, beta, esr) are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should backport easily to 57. A backport to ESR would be rather difficult.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The patch touches docshell which is heavily used, but it is small and follows our established practices so the risk should be low.

Sec-approval+ for checkin on November 28, two weeks into the new cycle. Please do not check in before that date.
We'll want this on other branches so branch patches should be made and nominated at that time as well. If you don't think we can easily do ESR52 (as mentioned in [comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c37 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames")) then we can go without it since it isn't that long until the next ESR branch.

bz: this patch needs review from a DOM peer, I'm sure you're busy, should I redirect to somebody else?
This is still a week and a half from landing but I'm going to be on PTO most of next week and was hoping to get the review done before leaving. If you're pinched for time, focusing on the docshell bits and ignoring the webextensions bits (which kmag reviwed) should be fine.

This needs a much better commit message, unless that would expose the security issue. It should describe what the new rules are and why the particular rules we're changing to are the ones we want. This is part of what made this review so slow. I've had to reverse-engineer the intent from the patch. I probably should have just brought this up immediately instead. :(
>+ , mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage(false)
I don't understand the desired semantics of mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage.
If I do window.open(url), should that really have different semantics from:
var w = window.open();
setTimeout(function() { w.location.href = url }, 100);
? It looks to me like the former would have mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage false while the latter has it true.
Same thing for <iframe> created without src and then getting it src attribute set.
>+ NS\_ENSURE\_ARG\_POINTER(aResult);
Please don't. Callers just shouldn't do that.

I'm not sure I follow. At the very least, this needs a comment explaining why.

That (exposing the issue) is what I was concerned about. I'm happy to expand on the commit message, but could use some feedback on how much is okay (ie from security).
Regardless, sorry for the confusion :/

Yes, that is desired for this particular scenario. This case may be rather narrow but consider a page that has a blank iframe and an extension that has the activeTab permission (but no specific host permissions). The extension can navigate the frame to some new URL, then inject a content script with allFrames: true and now they've managed to inject a script at a site that they should not have access to. If we could distinguish when the extension is the one navigating the frame perhaps we could use that, but I don't think we actually can make that distinction in a foolproof way.
(If the above has too much WebExtensions jargon please ask for clarification, I'd be glad to clear it up here or on IRC or whatever)

Can we start with a writeup in this bug of what the commit message would be if we ignore security considerations?
So if I understand correctly, if an extension has activeTab permissions we \_do\_ want to allow it to interact with cross-origin iframes the page itself loads, but not ones the extension loads?
Can the extension not inject the blank iframe itself? Can it not inject an iframe with src already set?

Correct, but only frames created by the network parser. It's too easy for the extensions to create frames from the context of content JS.

It can, but we're only allowing access to frames that were network-created.

Ah, I see. So the key part is that we're restricting this to <iframe> elements that have an src when they come out of the HTML parser, \_and\_ excluding cases when that parser is document.write() or innerHTML or whatever.
What happens if the extension injects something like:
<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src=whatever></iframe>"></iframe>
Does that inner iframe get treated as "created by the network parser"? If so, how is it handled by this setup?

That's a good question. I suspect that it does, but I'm not sure. We should test it.
I think we can solve that problem by checking the activeTab permission for parent frames when we do the matching.

I assume we can't easily leverage the "use the extension as the triggering principal for loads it starts" work, because that doesn't actually happen in all the cases we care about?

At this point, it's more that the extension can always do things using the page principal if it wants, using wrappedJSObject, eval, or injecting script nodes. I don't think there's really any reasonable way we can prevent that. I wish we could, though...

I tried this out and in my test, we never get around to checking hasNavigated.. since Matches() returns false here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/9bab9dc5a9472e3c163ab279847d2249322c206e/toolkit/components/extensions/WebExtensionPolicy.cpp#338-340>
This is over my head, I defer to kmag and bz to evaluate whether this is sufficient.

That will return false for the srcdoc iframe, but not for the iframe loaded from the parsed srcdoc attribute. Which may not actually exist in bz's actual example, depending on how the HTML parser deals with the invalid syntax from a > being present in an attribute value, but, e.g.:
<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src='[http://example.com/'&gt](http://example.com/%27%26gt);</iframe&gt>"></iframe>
for instance, should still wind up loading a content script into the example.com iframe.

Yes, I fixed that in my test. What I actually ended up with in the top-level doc is (as copied from devtools Inspector):
<iframe style="display: block;" srcdoc="<iframe src=&quot;[http://example.com/&quot](http://example.com/%26quot);></iframe>"></iframe>
The inner iframe didn't actually load anything from example.com though...

`>` ends an element declaration, even when it appears in an attribute value. At least in theory. But it looks like our tag soup parser currently accepts it, and:
document.body.innerHTML=`<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src='<http://example.com/>'></iframe>"></iframe>`
does appear to actually create an iframe with an example.com iframe loaded into it.

Bleah, never mind [comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames"), the inner frame was blocked by the CSP of the outer frame in my test.
With that removed, the script is indeed injected into the inner frame.

So I'm still a bit confused by the semantics of mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage. If the page has:
<iframe></iframe>
(no src attribute) and then the extension navigates the iframe to a url of its choosing, what will mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage be set to? Will the extension get access to the resulting page?Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

It shouldn't, but we should make sure that's tested.

Yep, that case isn't handled correctly.
Perhaps mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage is poorly named but the desired semantics are something like "false if this page/frame is what was originally loaded from the network, true if it is possible that a script has caused this page/frame to load something from a different source".
My first pass at this involved monkeying around with nsGenericHTMLFrameElement and that got kind of messy but it seems like this particular case isn't going to be detectable from the docshell and we'll have to go back to the frame element and track whether any of the frame's attributes have been changed? Any suggestions for simpler alternatives would be gratefully welcomed...

I agree that it's not clear how to detect this stuff from the docshell right now.
So one option is that the first time nsGenericHTMLFrameElement::LoadSrc reaches the mFrameLoader->LoadFrame() line for a given element that came from network, we indicate that to nsFrameLoader::LoadFrame somehow. This will, in practice, mean the load when we get inserted into the document.
I agree that threading this information through LoadFrame, LoadURI, frameloader initialization, etc, is a pain. I'm not seeing an obvious better option, though...

No tests. No bug that needs sec-approval should ever land with tests. If it is nightly and beta only, we can check in tests right after it lands on both. Otherwise, tests need to wait until about a month after public release.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

In theory a&b matches a user's expectation and Chrome compat is important, so I'm OK with it in theory. But implementing (b) raises all kinds of edge cases (some of which bz notes in comments above) that I worry in practice we won't be plugging the hole.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

"normal browsing" means with an unmodified browser; an attack like that can affect all our users. Installing an extension of any kind is already granting extra power that would be considered a security hole if a web page suddenly started doing it.

I haven't followed this thread for a while, so I wanted to chip in.
If I understand your proposed solution correctly, the idea is that with ActiveTab an extension can interact with iframes that were loaded by the original page, but not with iframes that were loaded by the extension itself.
I'd like to point out that many pages might have "high-value" iframes originally: Facebook Like buttons for example, are implemented as an iframe pointing to facebook.com. This means that if a page has a Like button, an extension with "ActiveTab" can steal that user's cookies and therefor identity. Google ads might be the same case.

Clarify rules for applying activeTab permission to content scripts
I \_think\_ there's a hole here, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
Say the page has <iframe src="foo">. We go through nsGenericHTMLFrameElement, set mLoadCount to 1.
Then a navigation is performed by setting frame.contentWindow.location.href. The docshell is not created dynamically, nsContentUtils::IsNavigatedFrame returns false, right? So we're going to end up returning true from ShouldMatchActiveTabPermission(), but the desired behavior is to return false, I would think. We should make sure to add a corresponding test. And tests for all the other edge cases we've considered in this bug so far...
That is, we need to keep track of whether the thing we're looking at was in fact loaded from the src attribute of the element, not just of how many loads were done from that src attribute.

Attached patch

[wip](attachment.cgi?id=8934269&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8934269&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1396399&attachment=8934269)

Here's a snapshot of the work in progress, I've rolled the tests into the
patch just to (hopefully) make it easier to look at for now. I've done
the rough work from [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames") but once we get into docshell I quickly
got lost. In the current patch I just remember the value of the incoming
flag in nsDocShell::LoadURI() but that's clearly too early, if the load
fails or if it ends up occurring in a different shell, we won't do the
right thing. But I am unsure how to handle this and could use some advice...

wip
I'm really sorry about the lag. I was trying to figure out what we're really trying to accomplish here.
So my gut feeling is that trying to store this in members on docshell/frameloader/etc is going to be very fragile.
It seems to me that conceptually we should do something like this:
1) A frame element <iframe> or <frame> keeps track of whether the load it's doing is for the initial value of the attribute for a parser-created element. More on this below.
2) We propagate this information far enough down the callstack to stash it in the LoadInfo of the channel.
3) When we need to find this information for a given inner window or document, we ask the document channel.
This would handle cases like the page having <iframe></iframe> with no src and the extension setting src later, for example....
Note that this sort of needs to operate on inner windows, not outer ones. I'm not sure why the existing checks are done on outer windows or docshells....
Does that make any sense?

Not to worry, thanks for being patient with the elementary questions and multiple iterations, I'm slowly absorbing everything here...

To be clear, is the way this information is gathered in the existing patch in nsFrameLoader adequate?

And do I understand correctly that this is again mostly what the existing patch does but enabling the new INTERNAL\_LOAD flag, then copying this into loadInfo inside nsDocShell::DoURILoad() ?

The code path in question here begins with an extension doing something like `browser.tabs.executeScript({tabid, {...}})` where tabid just identifies a tab (which corresponds to an outer window right?). At some point we need to map this to the specific document currently loaded in that tab. I'm having a hard time grokking all the different components here, is there a difference between accessing `outerWin.GetDoc()` and `outerWin.GetCurrentInnerWindow().GetDoc()`? (I know the syntax there is wrong but you get the idea)
> Does that make any sense?
I think so, assuming the answer to the questions above isn't "no you're wildly off the mark"

> To be clear, is the way this information is gathered in the existing patch in nsFrameLoader adequate?
Hmm. I guess we have to use a member there because the load goes async before it needs the "is this the original src?" info, right.
I read over that part just now, and it looks fine. I wish it were simpler, but I don't see how to do that offhand without major surgery of some sort.
> And do I understand correctly that this is again mostly what the existing patch does but enabling the new

That seems plausible, yes. I'd like to avoid the mFrameAtOriginalSrc member on docshell.
> where tabid just identifies a tab (which corresponds to an outer window right?)
Yes.

That makes sense.
> is there a difference between accessing `outerWin.GetDoc()` and `outerWin.GetCurrentInnerWindow().GetDoc()`?
There is not. I guess my point was that we want to store this "I am the result of this sort of load" information on the document (and then get it from the window's current document), not the docshell.

if there's a simpler way to do this I'm not seeing it :/

r=me with the nits fixed. Thank you for doing this.
And I agree that the way we had to propagate this boolean is moderately nuts. We should really simplify the loading codepaths and deCOM docshell loadinfo...

Why is it not injected into emptyframe?
There are some edge cases that are not really tested here:
1) <iframe> coming from innerHTML (should not get injected into).
2) <iframe> coming from an XHR responseXML (so from a network parser) and then getting adopted into the web page document.
3) innerHTML injecting an <iframe srcdoc> containing another iframe, as in [comment 45](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c45 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames").
4) window.open of a new window, which should get injected into, presumably.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the comment, are you concerned that the new tab can get created and loaded before we call awaitLoad()? There are many asynchronous things that happen between entering browser.tabs.create() and the corresponding onCompleted event firing, they would all have to go away for that to become an issue, which I think it is safe to say will not happen.

I've tried with the latest revision. Its not completely straightforward since a bunch of these functions get serialized into strings in extensions (but we write the code this way so we can lint the functions instead of putting the code into big string constants).

Oops, it means I meant to fill this in but I overlooked it before pushing. Sorry about that, I'll fix it.

Because in this case we're not passing the (somewhat misleadingly named) `matchAboutBlank` option to executeScript(). But I've done a bunch of refactoring of the tests and am now always passing that flag (and then checking empty frames as appropriate)

Whoops I realized I didn't cover this in the latest test patch.
However, we don't currently propagate activeTab to children created in this way, and my gut reaction is that we shouldn't do so. Maybe we could take this question to a follow-up bug?

> are you concerned that the new tab can get created and loaded before we call awaitLoad()
I'm concerned that it can get created and loaded before awaitLoad sets up enough of its state to be awaiting the load. Or is the idea that once awaitLoad has returned we are all set for the listeners it needs to add? If so this might be ok, though I would be happier if the awaitLoad() call happened \_before\_ the create() call.

Actually, we should probably just test that we do \_not\_ inject in that case, because an extension can do the window.open. Followup bug is OK for the test, though.

I would just do it on try at this point since it is checked into the integration branch.

Oops, my question about try was originally meant for trunk but now the main patch has landed. The patches apply cleanly to beta and all the new tests pass. I haven't done a beta try run but I think if the patch sticks on autoland we should be good:
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=autoland&revision=ff6e9d3a6441aa4510ed47d5383e79fe5a412576>
I'm going to request beta approval now since I'll be away from the computer for a while this evening but if the approval is granted quickly can we wait to see that the above run is green before landing there (:RyanVM I assume you are the one who would be doing the landing)

Is there a reason we don't listen to this frame's load with frameLoaded? Seems like we should (and nframes should be 4, not 3).
r=me with that fixed or explained. Thank you!

Set intestsuite? to flag them for later. It is going to be at least four weeks after a release containing the fixes, assuming normal uptake and that we don't, for example, turn off updates for a week to chemspill. In other words, I can't give a specific date at this time. Probably the end of February.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)
