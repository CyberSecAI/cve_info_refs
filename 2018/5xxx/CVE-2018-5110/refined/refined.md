Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5110:

**CVE Description:**

CVE-2018-5110: Cursor can be made invisible on OS X.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of cursor visibility when transitioning between a 'none' cursor and an image-based cursor via JavaScript on macOS. The logic for hiding/unhiding the cursor was not consistently applied across different cursor types (system cursors vs. custom image-based cursors).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Inconsistent cursor visibility management:** The core issue was that the `setMacCursor` function, which is responsible for hiding/unhiding the cursor, was not called in all cases when changing the cursor. Specifically when setting the cursor to an image, the hiding/unhiding logic wasn't executed.
- **Script-controlled cursor manipulation:** JavaScript could manipulate the cursor between 'none' and an image-based cursor. This allowed an attacker to trigger the bug and make the cursor invisible.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Cursor invisibility:** The primary impact was the user's mouse cursor becoming completely invisible within the Firefox browser. This would make the browser difficult to use and could lead to user frustration.
- **Potential for cursor hijacking:** The issue was considered security-sensitive because it could be exploited to create a form of "cursor hijacking", although the specifics of how this could be exploited aren't detailed. A user might not be able to see their mouse cursor and thus could be clicking on things without realizing where. This could be exploited by an attacker to trick users into clicking malicious links or buttons.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious website:** An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript code on a website that manipulates the cursor, triggering the bug and rendering the cursor invisible for users visiting the site.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** If a website was vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject similar code to manipulate the cursor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to execute JavaScript:** The attacker would need the ability to execute JavaScript code within the Firefox browser context.
- **Target users on macOS:** This issue specifically affects macOS users, as noted in the description.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involved moving the cursor hiding/unhiding logic to the `setMacCursor:` function, ensuring it's called for all cursor types, including when switching from a 'none' cursor to an image-based one. This ensures that the cursor is always shown when it should be.
- The vulnerability was initially classified as sec-low but was later upgraded to sec-moderate due to the potential for cursor hijacking.
- The bug was fixed in Firefox 58 and later versions.
