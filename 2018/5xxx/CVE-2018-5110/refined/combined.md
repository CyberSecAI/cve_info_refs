#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423275#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
There is a jsFiddle here: <https://jsfiddle.net/vb1ojdaL/>
Summarizing here; on OSX El Capitan using Firefox 58 (and developer edition) when you have an element with `cursor: none` set and you toggle (via JS) it back to an image based cursor (base64 encoded) when there is another fallback cursor available the mouse cursor will become entirely invisible across all tabs/areas of firefox until you mouse over certain system areas (not sure exactly which cause it to reset).
I have tested with a GIF and PNG that both appear to function correctly in chrome and on firefox in windows and both are broken on OSX.
Here is the rule I initially discovered this bug with:
cursor:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgBAMAAACBVGfHAAAAKlBMVEUAAAAzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMjZDADAAAADXRSTlMAYJ/vML9AEN/PUCBwo5BZ4wAAAGZJREFUKM9jQAFL1VH5jFctC1AEZBWcp6MouMTAYoQssAXIC0VWcNFZgekWsgm9Ika6AsgmMF10vohiBYOuCIoCBgaO26gKGHTRFDBdHFXAgK6A4RpUAUIATQHDnTRUBQx376IqAAB3TCfI3I+0DAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==) 0 31,crosshair;
Actual results:
The mouse cursor becomes invisible across the entire page (and all tabs of firefox.
Expected results:
I would have expected the cursor to be visible as it is on other browsers/operating systems.

Attached file
[test.html](attachment.cgi?id=8915061)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8915061&action=edit)

Found while investigating [bug 1403186](/show_bug.cgi?id=1403186 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV at null in [@fetch_add]").
STR:
1 host test.html locally with e.g., `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2 `MOZ\_LOG=timestamp,MediaManager:5 ./mach run localhost:8000/test.hml`
Expected:
No gUM permission prompt
Actual:
gUM permission prompt that asks for permission for audio capture for "mozilla.github.io". Also, clicking "Allow" results in starting audio capture.
I have not been able to circumvent the permission prompt. So storing a persistent permission for <https://mozilla.github.io> still results in a prompt.
I have not been able to start video capture this way. There is a guard at [1] which is probably what is catching this.
I am not sure whether one can do anything with the audio. It cannot be ruled out.
The captured audio stops after a while, presumable because GC collects the track. I have not investigated persisting the capture for longer.

Guard mediaDevices APIs from an invalid window
Is there a spec saying to do these checks? If so, what exception does it say to throw, and what actual check does it say to do? I doubt it says to throw NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE!
If there's no spec saying to do this, have you raised a spec issue? The spec should presumably say something here.Flags: needinfo?(apehrson)

> Is there a spec saying to do these checks?
There's no mention of anything like this in the mediacapture spec [1][2].
Note that this situation is the result of fuzzing with window.location.href = newurl; From [attachment 8915061](/attachment.cgi?id=8915061 "test.html") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8915061&action=edit "test.html"):
try { o1 = new XMLHttpRequest({mozAnon: true}) } catch(e) { }
try { o2 = window.navigator } catch(e) { }
try { o3 = o2.plugins } catch(e) { }
try { o4 = o2.mediaDevices } catch(e) { }
window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"
try { o1.open("T", "",false) } catch(e) { }
try { o1.send("") } catch(e) { }
try { o4.getUserMedia({audio: true, video: false, fake: false}) } catch(e) { }
I don't know enough about how window.location.href works here, but once this run of the event loop has finished, will there even any code left to observe a returned promise from o4.getUserMedia()?

Is this something individual domain specs are expected to handle? Is there a common pattern, or existing spec prose you could point me to as an example?

I guess the microtask queue would still run, so nm. Would it be better to return a Promise that never resolves here?

Patch aside, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around what code, if anything, can still be alive from the original test.html page once
window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"
has gotten far enough that we're seeing that origin in the permission prompt, and users had moused over to click "Accept"? - Is there an vector here for an attacker to record the user?

Why does code have to be alive from the test.html page?
You can load a page in a subframe (or window.open it), then grab the relevant objects from it, then navigate the page to a new origin, then call methods on the objects you grabbed, no?
> There's no mention of anything like this in the mediacapture spec [1][2].
Ok, that presumably needs fixing.
> Is this something individual domain specs are expected to handle?
Yes, depending on what "this" is. In general, specs are expected to think about what happens if their APIs are invoked in the context of a document that is not "active" or "fully active" in the sense of <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#active-document> and <<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active>>. For many APIs it's not a problem. For some it could be.
In any case, it seems like the problem on our end is that the prompt's origin is derived from a WindowProxy somehow, not from a Window. It's entirely possible that the spec simply assumes people won't do that (and indeed, they should not!).Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

That's \_if\_ the spec assumes you go through windowproxies at some point.
But even if it doesn't. I suspect that having permission prompts coming up for non-fully-active documents is weird and should not happen. Perhaps this should be handled by <https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#request-permission-to-use>

Yes, as in with the test case the permission prompt no longer appears. Just as getting navigator.mediaDevices for the first time would throw too.
FWIW, This is the relevant bit I find in mediacapture-main [1]:

This is outside my comfort zone, but on a hunch, does it mean anything that "Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing context's origin." happens in parallel here (e.g., after `window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"`)?

Good idea. I can repro that (get the misleading prompt) by hitting "Run" on <https://jsfiddle.net/jib1/aLbn85ku/8/> roughly ~1/20th of the time, sometimes much more frequently. But the promise never resolves when I hit "Allow", so maybe no recording risk.
More good news, even when I have persistent permission already granted for the good site (webrtc-landing), I still get prompted (even though we haven't implemented [bug 1299577](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299577 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Double-key origin for getUserMedia in iframes.") which is step 5 in the prose mentioned in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audio capture can start under wrong origin")). In the prompt I still get, if I check the "Remember this decision" box, the prompt UX says "Your connection is not secure...". Not sure how it figured that out since everything is https here, but go principals! Same for camera (s/audio: true/video: true/).

Good point, though from a quick search I see very few specs test for "fully active" on initial invocation. For those that do, I see InvalidStateError, TypeError, SecurityError. I guess we can take our pick?

How do we tell if it's a proxy?

I like that idea. Then we could throw NotAllowedError here.

Cc'ing Florian to see if he thinks [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audio capture can start under wrong origin") is an issue that extends to permissions outside of getUserMedia, or it's not if there's precedence on how to handle this.

Step 4 should probably be lifted outside of the "in parallel" steps here.

> 4. Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing context's origin.
Oh, boy.
1) A browsing context does not have a concept of "origin".
2) Touching a browsing context in an "in parallel" section is not OK.
3) The top-level browsing context may not have anything to do with the API being invoked,
as in the testcases in this bug.
Basically, this algorithm needs to capture the origin from a sane place before going parallel. Right now it's not doing any of those things.
> does it mean anything that "Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing
> context's origin." happens in parallel
Yes, it means that it's bogus spec text (or a threadsafety violation in implementation terms).
> But the promise never resolves when I hit "Allow", so maybe no recording risk.
Right, behavior of promises in navigated-away-from documents is ... complicated. Also not specified anywhere; the ES spec which defines promises has no concept of navigation.
> I guess we can take our pick?
Works for me. Just don't use Gecko-internal XPConnect error types like NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE. ;)
> How do we tell if it's a proxy?
I'm not sure what you mean. In spec terms, a WindowProxy is the JS object that more or less corresponds to a browsing context, effectively. It's the \_only\_ JS object for windows exposed to script. It generally forwards access on it to the current Window in the browsing context. A Window is the thing that's actually loaded at any given time.
In implementation terms in Firefox, if you're in JS, you have a WindowProxy. If you're in C++, and have a docshell, that's a browsing context. If you have an nsGlobalWindow, it could be an "inner" (spec Window) or an "outer" (spec WindowProxy).
Looks to me like the spec quoted above is looking at browsing contexts (though it doesn't define how it does that, exactly). So yes, it's going to get results that may have nothing to do with anything. It needs to not do that unless it's enforcing that those browsing contexts are somehow related to the API being called. If it checks "fully active", that's good enough; then it could examine the origins of the active documents in the relevant browsing contexts.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I have not actually verified, but yes I think this would not be specific to getUserMedia.

GetUserMedia should reject when document not fully active
Please don't reinvent nsPIDOMWindowInner::IsCurrentInnerWindow.
But also, this is not checking for "fully active". It's checking for "active". Kind of. It's possible for aWindow to not be current but its document to be active (e.g. in a document.open()) case. That's why we have nsIDocument::IsCurrentActiveDocument. And again, that doesn't test "fully active". We don't actually have a convenient way of testing "fully active" right now...

GetUserMedia should reject when document not fully active
The commit message still doesn't match the code, per [comment 20](/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audio capture can start under wrong origin"). Which one are you actually trying to do?

Attached patch

[GetUserMedia should reject when document not fully active](attachment.cgi?id=8923462&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8923462&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1405599&attachment=8923462)

Best would be to follow the spec and check for fully active. Does this work?

Is there a good reason for this to be a lambda instead of a static function?
>+ if (!win->IsCurrentInnerWindow()) {
Again, this is \_not\_ the right test for the spec concept of "active document". Please use the nsIDocument API I pointed to above.
>+ nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMElement> domFrameElement = context->GetFrameElement();
If we know we have an outer, we should really be able to use nsGlobalWindow::GetRealFrameElementOuter.
>+ nsIDocument\* owner = frameElement->GetOwnerDocument();
frameElement->OwnerDoc(), which is guaranteed to never be null.

AFAICT, this goes back to the Fx42 timeframe? Doesn't seem to meet the uplift criteria for ESR52, but feel free to set the status to affected and request approval if you feel strongly otherwise.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
