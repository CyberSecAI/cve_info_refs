Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5772:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an uncontrolled recursion within the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function in `src/image.cpp`. This happens when processing a crafted TIFF file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion: The function calls itself without proper termination conditions or depth checks, leading to a stack overflow.
- Lack of input validation: The software does not properly validate the structure of the TIFF file, allowing a crafted file to trigger the recursive calls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The uncontrolled recursion leads to a stack overflow and crashes the application, resulting in a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted TIFF file is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted TIFF file as input to the `exiv2` command-line utility or to any application using the vulnerable library.
- No special privileges or network access are needed, as the issue stems from processing the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The GitHub issue report ([#216](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/216)) provides a detailed stack trace showing the recursive calls.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file is available at the specified link: `<https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer/poc/blob/master/exiv2/exiv2_0-26_exiv2_uncontrolled-recursion_printIFDStructure.tif>`.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201811-14) lists CVE-2018-5772 alongside other CVEs affecting Exiv2. It confirms that a remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service by exploiting this vulnerability. The advisory mentions that versions of `media-gfx/exiv2` prior to `0.26_p20180811-r3` are affected.
