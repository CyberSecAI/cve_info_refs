  "CVE-2018-5118": {
    "description": "It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.",

        "Lack of sanitization of URLs"

        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to host a website that uses meta tags to reference file:// URIs. They would also need a means of inducing the user to visit this website."
