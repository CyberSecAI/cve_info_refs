Works on Linux too.
Dan: did you mean "RTL language" in the new title?
So the trick here is that the Arabic domain is RTL, so it appears on the right of the address bar, but then it gets pushed off by all the spaces and Hebrew text, because we are still left-justifying the contents? IOW, the fix is to make sure that the justification rules on the address bar are such that the actual domain is always visible?

Since this issue has a sec-moderate rating right now I don't want to track it for 56. We're getting close to the 56 release. Happy to take a patch for 56 if we land one.

Forwarding to Panos to evaluate the available resources.
It would be nice to fix it for sure, I don't know if it's as urgent to be in 56, the spoofed font is somehow recognizable and the identity panel points to the right domain. I can see it as a concern for a less expert user.
Surely the best thing would be to always scroll the locationbar to show the domain.Flags: needinfo?(mak77) → needinfo?(past)

We already do that (force selectionStart + End to 0). It's not clear to me off-hand what part of it isn't working somehow.

The url is LTR aligned (https is on the left), but the RTL chars are RTL aligned. And looks like there can be mixed direction domains. The input field is LTR in an LTR build.
There's some background in [bug 993806](/show_bug.cgi?id=993806 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - URL Bar text alignment in RTL mode") and [bug 641238](/show_bug.cgi?id=641238 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - The location bar alignment should be LTR, even though the Firefox build is RTL (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic..) — Regression from Firefox 3.6") for the braves.
Fwiw, Chrome puts the scheme in a static element, and scrolls all the rest of the string to the right. It may not be necessary to keep showing the scheme considered the identity panel? (they also don't decode the %20)

The trouble is, the domain is nowhere near the start (offset 0) of the urlbar content. Setting selectionStart/End to 0 ensures that the left-hand edge of the "https://..." scheme is visible; but then the domain is at the far right of the urlbar content, out of sight.
If I arbitrarily hack browser.js so that it sets selectionStart/End to 8 instead of 0 (i.e. placing the selection immediately after "https://"), then the testcase here behaves better, with the (Arabic-script) domain visible -- although not perfectly, because of the fade-out effect is still applied at the right-hand end, so the beginning of the domain name fades away. And of course now the scheme is no longer visible. So even if we did this (more correctly, by checking the actual offset of the domain rather than hard-coding "8"), it wouldn't be very satisfactory.
If we could avoid decoding the %20 characters, that would help quite a lot, although it could make some legitimate URLs look more ugly. (Note that the %20s in question are part of the fragment identifier here, not part of an actual domain label.) Offhand I'm not sure where to hack that, though.

That's why I'm wondering if, with the identity icon always visible, we still care about the scheme.
If we care, Chrome solution (sticky scheme) sounds feasible.

There's also the issue that the fade-out truncation we apply at the (right-hand) end of the urlbar results in fading the beginning of the domain name.

We could drop the fade out at the end and instead truncate in the middle with an ellipsis (…) so that the beginning and end of the URL are always visible. Is that what you mean by a sticky scheme, Marco?
I agree with Jonathan that not decoding the spaces would help a lot. I'd go further and say that by itself is an acceptable fix for this case. But I think I like the truncation idea, too.

yes, even if I'd not define that "in the middle", it looks like they put ellipsis just after the scheme (so the scheme is "sticky" positioned and the rest of the url is just scrolled to the far right).
Putting ellipsis in the middle, with that many spaces could still be confusing, especially on 16:9 and ultrawide (21:9) screens, the real domain would still be at the far right, while the fake one would still appear just after the scheme.

My interpretation of Chrome's behavior is that the ellipsis is at the (logical) end of the text, which means it appears at the left-hand end of the (right-to-left) text.
Something like this could possibly be achieved by wrapping the URL (not including the scheme) in an inline-block element with dir=auto and styling it with text-overflow:ellipsis, overflow:hidden, and width:.... umm, not sure what. I don't think -moz-available works here, so it might have to be computed somehow.
(Applying text-overflow:ellipsis to the URL as a whole (including scheme) cannot give this result, AFAICT from the spec for text-overflow.)
I suspect forcing the spaces to be displayed as %20 is much easier to implement as a short-term fix, however. Reworking the elements within the urlbar to separate the scheme from the rest of the URL (and allow us to align/truncate them separately) sounds....risky and disruptive.

So, I think that in any case we should show the %20, the spaces are just too confusing.
The 2 proposed solutions:
1. ellipsis in the middle:
- simpler and potentially upliftable
- on overflow it may still look confusing
scheme://fake.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20...%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
2. separate the scheme from the url, ellipsis at the end of the url
- more complex to do
- on overflow it's less confusing
scheme://...e.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
if there's no overflow, the 2 solutions look the same, and the confusion may be solved by the domain hilight. Regardless the hilight helps if we always show the domain, so probably solution 1 has better cost/benefit balance.

Just ensuring the spaces are displayed as %20 goes a long way towards mitigating this, IMO. I think we should do that immediately (and uplift it to 57), and then look into further improvements (either (1) or (2) above) as a followup for 58 or later.

Another interesting POC is using %e30%80%80 instead of %20. Pretty much any recognized whitespace.
To avoid decoding these, it may be enough to fix losslessDecodeURI that currently skips whitespaces on purpose, probably for beautification reasons.
I can try to patch it and see if any tests are failing. It will also need a test for these 2 cases, at least.Assignee: adw → mak77Flags: needinfo?(past)

And here comes back [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow") that makes cropping in the middle a nightmare. It may be easier to actually split the scheme considered that bug is open from 6 years and the proposals got few interest in W3C.
At this point I agree with [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), let's just show the encoded whitespaces and I'll file a separate public bug about cropping the urls better.

Attached patch

[don't decode whitespaces](attachment.cgi?id=8917347&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8917347&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8917347)

This just avoids decoding whitespaces, so they will stay % encoded.
Cropping is a more complex problem we'd better handle separately, I suggest a normal public bug in the Address Bar for that.
Does this sound sufficiently good to you?

Decoding whitespaces is a nice UX win. Can we refuse to decode them only when there's more than N of them, or a run of more than N of them, or something?

We will keep decoding them for javascript or exotic urls, the change only affects http, https, file and ftp schemes. For these I'm not sure there's any UX win.
While your suggestion is technically feasible, it would make the behavior more unpredictable and maybe even surprising, imo.

Really? I'd say that:

Fwiw, all the wikis I tried rewrite %20 to underscores, makes more sense imo, web devs should use underscores if they care about readability of their urls. Your example in reality would be <https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/CA_Information_Checklist>
To look into the other browsers, and understand if we're breaking users expectations: Chrome doesn't decode %20, as well as Edge. I don't have Safari at hand atm.
How would you measure the right N? The window and, as a consequence, the Address Bar, can be small. To hide the smaller host possible you may not need a lot of spaces, indeed even if invalid per RFC, some dns may support single letter hostnames.
If we only care to mitigate the problem, we could maybe allow single isolated spaces.
Let's see what the others think.

FWIW, I too think it would be preferable to find a way to keep decoding spaces in the "non-spoofy" cases for UX reasons, even if that makes the behaviour less predictable, because it'll keep the 'nice' behaviour for the common case while defeating spoofing attempts (if done right :-) ).

The only "right" way I can think of currently is to decode only isolated whitespaces.

Even if, something like "<http://fake.domain> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . real.domain" (or some unicode glyph even more subtle than a dot) could still be quite confusing.

The correct fix here is making sure that the real domain is always visible. Combine that with domain highlighting, and we are fine even if spaces are not decoded at all. Let's focus on that. If we want to stopgap by refusing to decode long runs of spaces, let's do it. But we are already at the edge case of edge cases. Phishers don't bother with this stuff for good reasons. It works fine without.

If we want the fix in 57 the only way would be to hide the scheme, and I'm not sure we're comfortable with that.
If we can wait, then surely we could look into the static scheme solution (that off-hand looks easier than waiting for [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow")).

How about a regex something like
/%(?!3B|2F|3F|3A|40|26|3D|2B|24|2C|23)|\s(?=\s)|\s$/
This would mean we'll encode any whitespaces that are followed by a further whitespace, or that occur at the end of the URL. (I'd have liked to catch any whitespaces -preceded- by another whitespace, too, but that would have needed a lookbehind assertion, which AFAIK isn't available in JS regex.)
I agree the proper solution is to make sure the real domain is always visible and highlighted, but I don't think we're going to fix that for 57, so I'd suggest doing a whitespace fix like this as an interim fix that could be safely uplifted (also to ESR if desired).

We should still always encode \r\t\n, even if they are not followed by another whitespace char. In my patch I just replaced them with \s because it was a catch-all solution. Surely it could be adapted, something like [\r\n\t]|\s(?=\s)|\s$
Though, gerv is right the only real solution is to show and hilight the real domain. I was looking for an "almost whitespace char" to see the effect. Replacing isolated spaces in this case doesn't help much, and I didn't search the whole unicode.

At that point, we're getting into territory that's more like the "barely noticeable combining mark" cases -- a glyph that is unambiguously visible (assuming non-broken fonts!), but nevertheless easily overlooked by users who aren't accustomed to noticing it.

Considering the approvals for 57 were just made strict to the point of "only if it may cause a chemspill release", I'd say we will just skip the stopgap solution.

Attached patch

[patch v2](attachment.cgi?id=8919079&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8919079&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8919079)

This is a possible patch. It still lacks tests, but I'd first like to collect some feedback.
\* multiple spaces are encoded as suggested by jfkthame, single spaces are not, so we retain ux advantage.
\* the address bar gradient is on the left or on the right, depending on the overflow direction.
\* there is an overlay label that always shows the scheme when it is overflowed and the url has a host.
\* I didn't use ellipsis because it's impossible without proper text-overflow support. If we'd have a text-overflow where one could define at which char to put the ellipsis, it would be trivial.
I tested this with an ltr long url, and this rtl-host long url, in ltr, rtl and dark theme modes. In all the cases both the scheme and the host are visible and the gradient is on the right side.
The code is not the cleanest, because while it's true we can set the selection to the end of the "scheme://", that still creates situations where the url is overflowed on both sides when moving between states.
It would be much simpler if we'd strip the scheme, but that creates more risks of regressions when we have to put it back, and we'd only strip some schemes, that would make things even more foggy.
Another alternative I tried, was to create a special kind of selection like SELECTION\_OMIT, that would not be drawn to the textrun. Then I could set that on the scheme, and always show the scheme in the separate label. It should be less regression prone, since the actual input value wouldn't change.
Unfortunately I'm not very good at layout code, I successfully introduced the selection type globally, but my changes to nsTextFrame.cpp didn't seem to work. Thus I don't know if it would properly align. Regardless, I'd need help implementing the omit selection type in the text frame, if we want to try that approach.
What do you think?

I tried this patch in a local build (based on current m-c tip), and while it seems like a possible way forward, I observed a couple of glitches that will need further work. As a testcase, I took the URL generated by the PoC here ([comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references")).
(a) When I paste this URL into the address bar of a new tab and press Enter, it is displayed with the https:// scheme visible (as expected), but then the URL is left-aligned, meaning that the fake "no.io" domain (actually part of the fragment id) appears after the scheme, followed by the sequence of spaces (all but one %20-encoded). The same occurs if I navigate to the URL by choosing it from the History menu. Also, note that the fade-out gradient is missing at this point.
(b) If I switch to a different tab, and then return to my test tab with the long URL, it now displays right-aligned, so that the real domain (اسماء.شبكة) is visible. However, the sequence of %20-encoded spaces in the fragment identifier are overprinting the still-visible scheme.
I'll attach screenshots of (a) and (b) as seen on my system.

Personally, I'd still favor doing a minimal patch that %-encodes multiple spaces (i.e. just the regex change in function losslessDecodeURI) and trying to uplift that to 57, as I think it's a useful mitigation with minimal risk. Then all further improvements would go into a future release. But I recognize I'm not an owner/peer here, so it's not my call.

No, I wasn't aware of that. Just tried it, though, and I'm still seeing the issues. The exact result (a) seems to vary -- a couple of times, it's appeared with the gradient on the scheme at the left, though still showing the wrong part of the URL; case (b) with the overpainted scheme after switching tabs seems consistently reproducible.

Ah, problem b) is related to the fact I was testing using Dark Theme. The css needs some tweaks for the default theme.
Problem a) seems to depend on whether the text was already overflowed before pasting.

This definitely looks better; I can no longer reproduce (b) at all, AFAICT.
I can still see some behavioral glitches, though, including a form of (a) in certain circumstances. I'll try to give STR that reliably misbehave for me:
(a) Visit the test URL from the PoC in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), so that it gets into History.
Open a new browser window (NOT a new tab in the same window).
Choose the test site's from the History menu.
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, so the wrong part of it (the fake "no.io") is visible.
Note that this only seems to happen for the first tab in a window.
(b) Visit the test URL from the PoC.
Copy the entire long URL to the clipboard.
Paste it back into the URL bar (overwriting the copy that's already there).
Press Enter to confirm ("navigating" to the page we're already on).
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, with a fade applied to the left-hand end.
>> Also, note that the https:// scheme label is missing.

Thank you, that was useful, all the reported issues should be fixed.
I'm not 100% sure about the text misalignment, since so far I only tested on Win, but I changed the alignment approach for a simple box centering.
I'll start looking into what I can add a test for.

I agree. This patch is a bit hard to evaluate since it tries to do different mostly unrelated things, there are many edge cases to consider, and the code isn't the cleanest, as Marco admitted. Can we just encode spaces here and move the other ideas to followups?Flags: needinfo?(dao+bmo)

The newest patch is much cleaner, surely there are a few edge cases, but in practice it relies on the formatting code now, that is well tested. Have a look at it, I think it's a pretty good MVP.
We can surely land the fixed at different times, but there are 2 reasons I didn't:
1. uplifiting to 57 is very unlikely, per rel-eng decisions, so the benefit of splitting for 58 is minor
2. even with the whitespaces fix, the bug is not really fixed, since the host is still not visible. It would make the url less confusable just for more savvy users. And by landing the first part we'd practically expose the problem without having the final fix at hand.

I tested briefly again with the new patch; this is definitely a lot more stable. At this point, I've only noticed a couple of relatively minor glitches (again, I'm testing on a Mac, in case this has any significance):
1. Open a new window.
2. Load the test URL from the PoC above (the "fake no.io").
> It displays correctly, with the Arabic-script domain visible at the right, the scheme visible at the left, and the long URL truncated (with fade-out) before it hits the scheme
3. Now, assume we want to edit the URL. So click in it, let's say at the dot in the domain name.
> The focus goes to the URL bar, and the entire URL is selected
> HOWEVER, sometimes (maybe one in three or four times, the URL "jumps" horizontally so that the domain is no longer visible, and I'm looking at a run of encoded spaces (%20%20%20%20...)
4a. Click in the (now-selected) URL a second time, to place an insertion point for editing.
> If the URL didn't "jump-scroll" in the previous step, this behaves fine. If it did, the insertion point seems to be misplaced by a few characters from where I clicked.
4b. Instead of clicking in the selected URL to begin editing, I change my mind and click back in the content of the page.
> The URL bar loses focus, but in the process its content momentarily jumps to the wrong end of its scroll range, before reverting to the expected right-aligned scroll position. This produces a distracting visual flicker as the text skips back and forth.

I fear the jumping issue is due to the underlying editor and I'd not have much control over that from the urlbar code.
If it just happens for overflowed urls with RTL domains, it sounds like an edge case, so we may ignore it for now. I'll have a look at it.

This may be unavoidable unless we have a way to tell if the first char after the scheme is RTL. Do you know if we have something like that exposed to js?

After some testing, I think this is a bug somewhere in the editor or the selection code, that is uncovered by the rtl selection. Indeed the only thing we do is a call to .selectAll(). I don't have much control over that, but it seems rare enough to not be a blocker.

It's not limited to cases that involve RTL; I've also seen it with purely LTR long URLs. But on checking, I find that I can also reproduce it (intermittently) in a current nightly (i.e. without the patch here), in the existing URL bar. So as you say, it's not an issue with this patch; it seems to be a bug elsewhere in editor/selection handling.

Drive-by (sorry) - this should have a check against re-entrancy (ditto for the further-nested updates a bit further down).

I'm afraid the whole .urlbar-scheme-box[scheme][textoverflow="start"] thing is an edge case. :/
It will be easy to regress and we won't necessarily catch that in nightly testing.

With the whitespce fix, this bug doesn't seem severe enough to me to be concerned about that. But we can land without a commit message and keep this bug marked security-sensitive for as long as we want.

Hmm, this isn't how SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY works. It explicitly doesn't use the alpha channel since this might get us grayscale anti-aliasing:

It is sort-of an edge case, but this bug is about an edge case.
I agree it's something we may miss in Nightly, that's why I added a test, so we don't regress.

If dveditz is fine with that, no problem on my side.
I still think not showing the domain doesn't really fix anything for the non-technical users, it will just be a weak indicator: "something looks strange, but I see a host here".
But for the next version I will split the patch into the 2 parts.

I want to address the re-entrancy Gijs pointed out and re-test for this tab switching case, I didn't see it on Win/Mac.
I suppose the 1px offset is not a critical problem, considered as you said this is an edge case, and security comes first.

I know, but I have no way to reproduce what the textframe is doing.
Is it critical to have subpixel AA in a small label shown in edge cases? Any alternative suggestion on how to achieve that?

If we want to commit to doing this, I'd rather do it right. These kind of glitches that aren't covered by the test and will only add up over time are exactly what concerns me.

Perhaps use a textframe with SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY?

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8926403)

This is the part we agree upon: don't decode consecutive spaces. It preserves UX for urls having single spaces to separate words, but makes long runs of spaces visible and likely warnings the user something may be wrong.
I'm still looking at the second part (always show the domain) to see if I can reproduce the reported intermittent issues.
Daniel, would you be fine with landing the first part for now, so that consecutive spaces are shown encoded, and keep the second part for later when we are more comfortable with it?
Do you think there's risk exposing a partial fix to the problem?

I'd leave the reference to that old bug and tweak the wording a bit:
"Re-encode select whitespace so that it doesn't get eaten away by the location bar ([bug 410726](/show_bug.cgi?id=410726 "RESOLVED FIXED - address bar eats escaped newlines")). Re-encode all adjacent whitespace to prevent spoofing attempts where invisible characters would push part of the URL to overflow the location bar."
Maybe also add a reference to this bug. Blame is a bit annoying here because these lines tend to get touched again and again.

I've updated the comment locally, though now it's basically exposing what this bug is about and how to reproduce it.
Imo that forces us to move the remaining work to a separate bug. Let's see what Daniel thinks.

This fixes the opacity AA, the alignment and the re-entrancy. I didn't have a chance to test the Linux intermittent problem. Testing is welcome.

I agree w/Dão that we shouldn't remove the old bug reference and should add a reference to this bug.
Should be fine to land just this part -- spaces are already known to be spoofy and nothing here references the RTL aspect.

Can we add a test with two embedded spaces (possibly different ones, like %20%C2%A0) to show the expected "%20 " behavior and not " %C2%A0"?

What did you update the comment to? If you take the comment I saw and just stick "([bug 1395508](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"))" on the end it's not revealing the key part of this. Even if it does I'd prefer keeping the work in this bug. Something like

should be fine, and then keep the remaining work in this bug.

We will actually show "%20%C2%A0" and not " %C2%A0" because they are considered consecutive spaces and thus re-encoded by this patch. I still added the test, I hope it's ok, it should be from the point of view of this report.

I tried to reproduce and verify the fix of this issue. Based on [Comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), I suppose that the fixed builds should displayed the real domain (سماء.شبكة). Compared with Chrome, where the real domain is always in focus, on Firefox the domain is displayed only at the end of the URL (can be seen only by using the horizontal scroll). Not sure what the fix should be here! Am I missing something?

Yes, the "always show domain" fix didn't land here but has been moved to [bug 1419391](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419391 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), because the patch is fragile due to missing editor APIs and there's some discussion about a completely new approach for the Address Bar that would be less likely to suffer from spoofing attempts. That didn't happen yet.
What landed here is the patch that decodes multiple whitespaces when they are adjacent, that by itself makes the user less likely to fall for the spoofing attempt since there's no long empty space after the fake domain making it look good.Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

I retested this issue, by taking into account the information mentioned above, on latest Nightly 60.0a1 (2018-01-22) and on Release 58.06 - build 6 under Windows 10 x64, Ubuntu 12.04 x32 and macOS 10.13. I can mark this bug as verified fixed.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

#### [#CVE-2018-5111: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop](#CVE-2018-5111)

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

|  | |

In 1393924 we introduced functionality to pull images references from meta tags, so that we show better screenshots on the newtab page. I'm not sure if the screenshot code is new or existing, but as a consequence, web pages can the content process to attempt a load of a local file. Luckily the sandbox stops the load, but it seems bad that the load is even attempted.
STR:
Create a page with a tag like:
<meta name="twitter:image" content="file:///Users/paul/Pictures/dog.jpg">
Expected results: nothing loads
Actual results:
Error message observable in system console:
getScreenshot error: Error: page-thumbnail:error
After turning on sandbox logging (set security.sandbox.logging.enabled to true), I noticed the content process failing to access a file, using OSX console:
"SandboxViolation: plugin-container(39465) deny file-read-metadata /Users/paul/Pictures/dog.jpg"
The code in ContentMetaHandler[1] doesnt seem to do any validation of the data pulled out of the content page. That sounds dangerous to me, but Im not sure if the expectation is that sanitzation/validation happens later.
[1] <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm#74>
== Impact==
Allowing web pages to coerce chrome privileged requests (I assume this is chrome privileged since the file load occurs) is dangerous. I don't \_think\_ there is any way to exploit this directly since a) the content doesnt come back to the web and b) sandboxing adds a layer of defense. But not fixing this seems like it would be asking for future trouble if this bug could be chained with something else.

Places stores all sorts of uri specs including file: place: about: schemes, so it might be acceptable to store potentially unused file: preview\_image\_url entries (where either activity stream or the thumbnailer decides not to use)
The saving of the file uri as preview\_image\_url to places happens before an attempt to thumbnail it, but not all preview\_image\_url entries result in a thumbnail request which would happen at some later time from some other content process.

I think the defense-in-depth solution here would be:
- add a checkloaduri check in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/33c90c196bc405e628bc868a4f4ba29b992478c0/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm#98-105> , and ignore tags that have URLs that the webpage shouldn't be allowed to link to.
- in AS / thumbnailer where we read/load preview\_image\_url entries, ensure that the request has the correct triggering/loadingPrincipal, such that gecko/necko/caps automatically says "no" a second time.
But we really ought to do at least one of these. file: things are sandboxed, but chrome: (and moz-icon: and ...) things are not, and just allowing any old request might well bite us at some point, even if right now, all we do is try to load it in an image element or as a background-image element.

We do have [Bug 1397800](/show_bug.cgi?id=1397800 "NEW - Be smarter about handling malformed meta tags") on our radar about being smarter when handling meta tags. We could potentially do this work there as well as a bunch of other stuff to gracefully handle these kinds of cases

Sounds good Ursula - is this 1397800 already prioritized? If not it, could I ask that it be considered as soon as possible. Frederik Braun pointed out that one tangible attack here is to inject a UNC network path ( \\machine\share\ ). This could be potential used to induce the victims machine to connect remotely over an insecure protocol (e.g. SMB) and enable a number of attacks. Marking as sec-high for this reason.
Its also possible that this bug is the cause of [bug 1419790](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419790 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - User's browsing history from other tabs/highlights is exposed in Google Analytics via twitter:image tag used by Highlights"), which is why I was looking at this code in the first place.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)See Also: → [1419790](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419790 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - User's browsing history from other tabs/highlights is exposed in Google Analytics via twitter:image tag used by Highlights")

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The use of checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal looks great. However, I do have some other comments, see below.
Note that as a sec-high, the tests would have to land separately and you'll need sec-approval before landing this (once it has r+ etc.)
Are you still planning to also pass a principal to the loadURI call inside the thumbnailer code? Did you run into issues with that that I could help with? (Only) When it comes to security, I'm partial to a belt + braces approach...

Nit: you can add this specifically to the test where you use a particular file. This makes it easier to (re)move tests if that's ever necessary. So:
[browser\_bad\_meta\_tags.js]
support-files = bad\_meta\_tags.html
(it'll "inherit" the head.js from [DEFAULT] )

So, bizarre protocols are allowed (hence the twitter:image example in the browser\_bad\_meta\_tags.js).
Would you be opposed to enforcing the target URL must be an http/https URI? If that sounds OK, you could modify this method to take a URL object and, before calling checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal, doing something like:
if (!["http:", "https:"].includes(urlObj.protocol)) { return false }

Is this the correct principal? I was expecting that we would use the page's principal here. Are we using null principal, because at this point we don't have access to the actual principal of the page which contained the meta tag? I guess that is OK - but I think this will be more restrictive, than if we passed the page's principal - I wonder if this will break the feature?

Just a note re: the sec-high here - that may actually be a bit overrated, but I was being conservative because:
- this bug allows a webpage to trigger a file load
- I \_think\_ this could be used with a UNC path to cause the user make an insecure load EXCEPT that
- our sandbox blocks this (at least on OSX)
The reason why I marked this high, despite the sandbox, is that read access isn't totally locked down on windows, and I don't know how the windows sandbox interacts with UNC paths (what integrity would they get? Something I need to test...). If it is even possible i think it would actually be very difficult to exploit, but I'm just being cautious, especially since the fix is relatively straightforward.
TLDR: Al, when you are looking at sec-approval I don't think we have to be TOO cautious about this, and also I think its pretty unlikely that this would be exploited, so I wouldn't suggest we rush a fix out for this. (But happy to be overruled if Im missing an attack vector here).

Yeah, this is more restrictive. We do actually have the original principal, I think, from the meta tag's nodePrincipal (in the caller of this utility method, so we could pass it in). Anyone can link to http/https images, I think, including null principals, so I think being more restrictive is OK? We could use the node principal if that seems preferable.

No, totally agree with more restrictive, just wanted to make sure I understood the decision, thanks.

I can do that as well, I thought I could do that in a separate patch that I could test, mostly to keep this one contained in the metadata parsing module. Does that sound ok?

This was just the easiest way to test if it got the correct content for the tag it parsed. Technically new URL("twitter:image") is actually valid so checking the href on it works for the sake of the test.

I'd just split out the test changes to a separate patch and attach it separately, then consult with the security team about when to land.

OK, so, um, it would have been a good idea to read <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> . Please don't push patches like this to try (which is public), certainly not patches that have full descriptions of what the issue is. People watch our checkins, especially for sec bugs landing. :-(

This is a good idea. I think in our new lando/phabricator world, we'll have a private place for sec patches, so hopefully/maybe also a private try repo? X-ref [bug 1136954](/show_bug.cgi?id=1136954 "NEW - Build a private/hidden try server for security sensitive bug testing"). I would support having a push hook in the interim, though. I'll file a bug.

Right, sorry for not bringing it up earlier, and for the tone of [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs") - I should have been more constructive. :-(
I thought this page used to be linked from the sec-approval request template that you filled in, but I must have imagined that, and I don't remember how else I would have found out about it, it's been too long.
As Paul said in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs"), so far we don't have a concretely exploitable thing because the sandbox saves our ..., so I hope/assume we'll be OK.

Ahhhh. I did spend some time looking for this warning and didn't see it anywhere. I'm glad I'm not entirely crazy (though it's sad it doesn't appear consistently).

sec-approval+ for trunk for the patch \*without\* any tests. Do NOT check in tests into mozilla-central. Tests need to not be checked in until well after we ship Firefox 58 with this fix. This is so we don't 0day ourselves anymore than we may already have.
Let's get the patch nominated for beta as well so we fix it everywhere.

Yes, have to do that manually after the training of the Softvision sheriffs.

1420049.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 1393924](/show_bug.cgi?id=1393924 "RESOLVED FIXED - Collect description and preview image and store it into moz_places")
[User impact if declined]: potential to read files (stopped by sandbox in e10s, but not otherwise)
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: generally yes. For this specific issue, there are tests but we won't land them until this is released because it's a sec-high sec bug.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Probably good given lack of automated testing in the tree right now. See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs"). After setting security.sandbox.logging.enabled to true, it should be possible to verify that prior to the patch, sandbox errors are logged (if e10s is enabled). After the patch, there should be no sandbox errors for the file embedded in the page that AS is loading.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: n/a
[Is the change risky?]: not really
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: adding necessary security checks to some utility code. This shouldn't affect well-meaning webpages, ever.
[String changes made/needed]: none.

Personally, I think it would be easier to track the tests in a separate bug, because the target milestone and per-release affected/fixed/verified flags are going to be more sane (rather than either being wrong for the patch or wrong for the tests). Up to you though, you're the bug assignee. If we want to leave this open, we can do, but then we may need to chase people for uplift requests.

Lowering the severity a bit. Attacking page can trigger activity stream to attempt loading a URL, but the content of that URL doesn't get passed back to the page. There's no same-origin information leak, even if the file: did get loaded. A bigger worry to me is if some chrome: url or moz-extension: url (assuming you can guess the UUID; currently possible in some cases) performs some action that would be dangerous just by loading it (not necessarily rendering it). I can't think of any off-hand, but some legacy extensions had security bugs by exposing custom protocol handlers so it's not out of the question. Maybe that's already protected against on the Activity Stream side? Probably not because if we were loading file: urls (without the sandbox) then we weren't calling checkLoadURI and I'm not sure what else would filter out chrome:.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)
