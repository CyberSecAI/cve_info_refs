# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423275#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
There is a jsFiddle here: <https://jsfiddle.net/vb1ojdaL/>
Summarizing here; on OSX El Capitan using Firefox 58 (and developer edition) when you have an element with `cursor: none` set and you toggle (via JS) it back to an image based cursor (base64 encoded) when there is another fallback cursor available the mouse cursor will become entirely invisible across all tabs/areas of firefox until you mouse over certain system areas (not sure exactly which cause it to reset).
I have tested with a GIF and PNG that both appear to function correctly in chrome and on firefox in windows and both are broken on OSX.
Here is the rule I initially discovered this bug with:
cursor:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgBAMAAACBVGfHAAAAKlBMVEUAAAAzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMjZDADAAAADXRSTlMAYJ/vML9AEN/PUCBwo5BZ4wAAAGZJREFUKM9jQAFL1VH5jFctC1AEZBWcp6MouMTAYoQssAXIC0VWcNFZgekWsgm9Ika6AsgmMF10vohiBYOuCIoCBgaO26gKGHTRFDBdHFXAgK6A4RpUAUIATQHDnTRUBQx376IqAAB3TCfI3I+0DAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==) 0 31,crosshair;
Actual results:
The mouse cursor becomes invisible across the entire page (and all tabs of firefox.
Expected results:
I would have expected the cursor to be visible as it is on other browsers/operating systems.

setMacCursor: is called from both setCursor: and setCursorWithImage:, but only setCursor: hides/unhides the mouse cursor. Moving the hiding/unhiding to setMacCursor: fixes the bug.
I've kept the commit message intentionally vague.

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open poc.html(attached).
2. Drag and Drop the text in the page into the address bar.
3. notice that now is shown "<https://www.google.com>", even though the page hasn't been loaded.

> Is this being ignored?
No. All of Mozilla is in conference this week, and will be (and traveling) until the begining of next week, so that impacts people being available to work/triage this.
From a quick look, this doesn't look like a complete spoof (security info (lock) isn't changed) and so this is sec-moderate or lower, so it isn't a "drop everything and fix this" kind of bug.
I also believe other patches I have in flight already might address this bug, but due to the above I just haven't had cycles to check that.

This is no longer broken on today's nightly. I suspect my belief was right and that my fix for [bug 791597](/show_bug.cgi?id=791597 "VERIFIED FIXED - Dragging and dropping URLs leads to address bar spoofing") fixed it. I think I'd like to poke at this more though, feels like we should do more checks on the URI before even attempting to load it (and put it in the URL bar).Blocks: [CVE-2017-5417](/show_bug.cgi?id=791597 "VERIFIED FIXED - Dragging and dropping URLs leads to address bar spoofing")

> Any updates on this?
Any updates will appear in the bug. This is still on my list, but I'm on holiday right now. I don't believe this is critical - your testcase requires substantial user action and does not spoof the lock icon (so it's not a complete URL bar spoof). In that sense it's even less severe than 791597, which was sec-moderate.
The testcase doesn't currently work at all on Nightly, but I'm not sure if that will still be the case after I fix [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area"). I don't have time to test this right now (as I said, I'm on holiday). I'll look at it again after I get back, update the patch there and get it to land.

Like it would make it any difference in the real world scenario. Quit being so naive.

Calling people "naive" is rude and unhelpful, Mario. Be respectful, as requested (and you've been asked previously in other bugs so this is an ongoing issue when you get impatient with people).

I was right in my suspicion that fixing [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area") will make nightly vulnerable again.
I see several avenues we could pursue to fix this:
1) break all dragging to the URL bar. This is what Edge does. (I don't think this is a good idea. Something about the baby and the bathwater.)
2) break dragging plaintext to the URL bar. This is what IE does.
3) always search for non-URL drops. This is what Chrome does.
4) attempt to build some kind of heuristic to determine whether this is an attempt to spoof the user.
I don't think (4) is likely to work. There will always be more ways (specifically, more unicode characters) to spoof things than we can try to work around, and so I'm not particularly interested in trying. We do need to continue to support unicode typing and dragging to the URL bar for people who don't live in the English or other latin-charset-based languages, so I think that's a losing battle.
I would like to propose (3), with fallback to (2) if the user has toggled the hidden keyword.enabled pref, and while simultaneously improving our url fixup (e.g. [bug 1181081](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181081 "RESOLVED FIXED - urifixup service should correct \"http//\" or \"https//\" or \"http;//\" etc. to insert/replace the colon")) and using it explicitly in the dnd code, to mitigate cases where people "almost" drag a URL to the URL bar, like just dragging "google.com" or "/google.com" etc.
This is a change in UX, so I would like some buy-in from the UX team as well as Marco (with whom I've discussed this before now...) before working on this.
Philipp, the TL;DR here is that dragging arbitrary text to the URL bar and leaving it there is perceived to be a spoofing risk, especially because the user can't always control what the text is (websites can manipulate this). While Marco and I have discussed alternative solutions like showing the current page's URL when the URL bar is not focused (rather than the user's last input), that would likely be confusing and potentially break particular usage scenarios (drag text, then type) and/or not really fix the spoofing risk if users don't re-check the URL bar after re-focusing the content. So I listed some avenues above that we could explore. As noted, I would lean towards (3) unless you have strong objections.

Yep, we need to fixup the text, it would be sad to drop "www.mozilla.org" and run a search cause it's not a complete url.
Chrome is doing something similar, as I previously said, any text is automatically searched, unless it "looks like" a url, then it is fixed up and visited. I don't think there's any situation where they allow you to drop something in the urlbar and it stays there to be further edited. And in spite of this report, it makes sense as a behavior.
The only 2 problems I see:
1. UX change. User can't drag&drop a text, modify it to his likes and THEN start a search or a visit. This feature gets lost. On the other side, it sounds like an edge case, so we could just decide to take the hit.
2. D&D won't have the same behavior as C&P. IIRC we previously discussed this and there was some hint that we don't consider these 2 operations the same, in terms of spoof, cause C&P requires 2 actions and you see what you are copying (unless the web page populates the clipboard for you!). Before implementing a fix very specific to D&D, we should evaluate how much we care about C&P case, if we care a lot, maybe we need a broader approach? That said, if the patch here ends up being "simple" enough, we could take it regardless as a step forward.Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

Copy and paste is also more useful (in the location bar) right now than DND is. I paste things without wanting to use "paste and go" immediately, and then edit, also because paste gives you control over the insertion point, which we don't do for DND (even though on some OSes we'll show a cursor in the middle of the text while dragging :-\ ).

Thanks for the summary!
I agree with your proposal of going with 3) -- just tried this in Chrome and that behavior seems fine to me.Flags: needinfo?(philipp)

Any updates on this?
Since Gijs claims this doesn't affect Nightly version. Is this a dupe?
Is this going to be fixed? Are there any estimate date for when it's coming out?

I pointed out in [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL bar spoof using drag and drop (dnd) and unicode-lookalike protocol to drag plaintext that \"looks like\" a valid URL") that fixing [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area") would re-break Nightly. As you can see in bugzilla, I fixed [bug 1324410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1324410 "VERIFIED FIXED - cannot drop selected text on Location Bar from content area"), so this is no longer 'fixed' in Nightly - dragging text to the location bar was just buggy in Nightly for a time, which also 'fixed' this bug as long as it was broken.
> Is this a dupe?
No.
> Is this going to be fixed?
Yes.

Mario, this is a sec-moderate issue. It isn't an emergency and devs will work on moderate issues as they can to get them fixed. You don't need to ask "is this going to be fixed?" That's a bit insulting.

hey,
since this isn't being fixed so soon. Has the bug bounty decision been made?
it's complicated working with you guys, everything that I say results in complains. What's the deal? I ask for updates because it seems like the bugs has been forgotten even thought it's sec-moderate it's still a bug and is restrict(if it wasn't so important, it'd open to everybody see).
everything that it's asked seems to be "insulting", didn't know mozilla was \*that\* sensitive.

Mario,
Bugzilla shouldn't be used in place of email. If you have questions, as has been said before, please email security@mozilla.org and leave the bug for discussions of patches or technical questions or requests. For the hundredth time, please quit asking for "Is there an update" or similar \*in the bugs\*. If the devs have an update, it will show up here. There is nowhere else for it to appear. If there are no updates here, then there are no updates. All general questions should be sent to us in email, not added to the bug (over and over).
> it's complicated working with you guys, everything that I say results in
> complains. What's the deal?
This is because people find your behavior to often be rude.
> I ask for updates because it seems like the bugs
> has been forgotten even thought it's sec-moderate it's still a bug and is

Bugs aren't forgotten. We have regular reports of unfixed security bugs. We are aware that they exist. Sec-critical bugs get the highest priority, followed by sec-high bugs. Sec-moderates are fixed as makes sense but they don't necessarily override the priority of other, ongoing, work, and are not considered emergencies.
> everything that it's asked seems to be "insulting", didn't know mozilla was
> \*that\* sensitive.
It is because of both how you ask and the fact that on just about every bug that you report, you wind up engaging in this behavior. We do notice these things and it becomes tiresome. You've literally interacted with Mozilla for \*years\* so you should know how our processes work and what we've asked you to do or not do in the past.

Attached patch

[The patch](attachment.cgi?id=8925542&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8925542&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1321619&attachment=8925542)

This executes the default action associated with the text that was dropped on the location bar, which is usually a search. If the "keyword.enabled" preference is false in about:config, this will perform a navigation, rather than disallowing the drop. This is because this preference is hidden, so I went with the simplest approach. I also haven't written an explicit test case for it.
I'll land this patch with the bug number once it's reviewed. I've started a tryserver build here:
