The provided content is related to CVE-2018-5341.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper permissions on the C:\ManageEngine directory, which allowed non-privileged users to escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper permissions on the C:\ManageEngine directory.
- Unauthorised access to command prompt with SYSTEM privilege.
- Unauthenticated file deletion from the Endpoint Central server machine.
- Unauthorised execution of queries to alter entries in the database.
- Unauthenticated execution of queries bypassing query type restrictions.
- Unauthenticated execution of web executables throughout the network via directory traversal or file type restriction bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for non-privileged users.
- Full control over the endpoint by leveraging SYSTEM privileges.
- Data loss due to unauthorized file deletion from the server.
- Data corruption or manipulation due to database alteration.
- Network-wide compromise via remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of the C:\ManageEngine directory permissions.
- Accessing the command prompt with SYSTEM privileges through the Endpoint Central Agent.
- Sending unauthenticated requests to delete files on the Endpoint Central server.
- Sending unauthenticated queries to manipulate database entries.
- Sending unauthenticated requests to execute arbitrary web executables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on a machine with the Endpoint Central Agent installed or be in a position to send unauthenticated requests to the Endpoint Central server
