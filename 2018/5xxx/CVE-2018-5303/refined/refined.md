The provided content describes vulnerabilities found in the IMPINJ SPEEDWAY R420 RFID READER. It mentions two specific vulnerabilities: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking. The CVE-2018-5303 is mentioned along with CVE-2018-5304 in the text.

**Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root Cause:** The license key parameter of the web application is vulnerable to XSS. User-supplied input is stored and later embedded into the application's responses without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization leading to the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of any user viewing the affected content in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, password changes, and keystroke logging.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the license key parameter via the web interface.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to access the web interface of the RFID reader and to modify the license key parameter.

**Clickjacking:**
*   **Root Cause:** The web interface lacks the X-Frame-Options header, making it vulnerable to being loaded within an iframe.
*   **Weakness:** Missing X-Frame-Options header in HTTP responses.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can trick users into performing actions (mouse clicks, keystrokes) within the targeted web application by embedding it in an iframe within their page, thereby allowing them to execute unintended commands or reveal confidential information.
*  **Attack Vector:** Embedding the vulnerable web application within an iframe and tricking the user into interacting with it.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to create a malicious webpage that embeds the target application in an iframe.

The blog post mentions that the vulnerabilities were reported to the vendor in 2017, confirmed, and then fixed in a later version in 2018 and CVEs were assigned.

It is also noted that the stored XSS is both reflected and stored, executing two times in the same page.
