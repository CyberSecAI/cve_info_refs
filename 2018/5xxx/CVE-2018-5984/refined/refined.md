Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `category` parameter of the Tumder application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is **SQL Injection (SQLi)**. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This can lead to:
    *   **Data breaches:** Reading sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Data manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** Potentially gaining control of the database server itself.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the availability of the application by manipulating the database.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the application, specifically by crafting a malicious URL with a SQL injection payload in the `category` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or authentication is mentioned to be needed to exploit the SQLi. The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and the specific vulnerability within the Tumder application.

**Additional Details:**
The provided exploit shows a specific proof of concept payload that extracts database information, version, and user. This highlights the ability to use the SQL injection to exfiltrate information. The vulnerability is located in the `/category/` endpoint of the application.
