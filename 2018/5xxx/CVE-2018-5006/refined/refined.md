Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application allows an attacker to make requests to internal resources, which is the core weakness of an SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to sensitive information disclosure. This is because the attacker can potentially use the vulnerable server to access internal resources or systems, and retrieve data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted requests that exploit the server-side request functionality to access internal resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests that can trigger the SSRF vulnerability. No specific privilege or position is stated other than this ability.

**Affected Versions:**
- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) versions 6.4 and earlier are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is consistent with a typical SSRF vulnerability. The attacker can abuse the server to make requests to internal resources, which the attacker cannot directly reach, which leads to potentially sensitive data leakage. The provided details are more specific than the description which is only a placeholder.
- The fix for this CVE is through the installation of Hotfix 24289.
