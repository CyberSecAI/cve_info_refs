  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-5758",

    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability"

    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the operating system and retrieve directory listings of any folder. This can lead to information disclosure, including sensitive system files and application data.",

    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to log in to the Jive-n application and upload files, which might be achieved through password reuse or spear phishing.",
     "details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to render the document using Flash. The application initially saves the file as a draft, but the XXE is executed when the 'View' option is clicked for the uploaded file. The application server makes an HTTP request to an attacker controlled server, the server responds with a DTD which instructs the application to send a local file via FTP to the attackers server. The vulnerability could be used to get directory listings by requesting 'file:///etc/'"
