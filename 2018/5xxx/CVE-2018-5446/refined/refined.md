**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format (CWE-257)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with physical access to a 2090 Programmer can obtain per-product credentials to the software deployment network. These credentials grant access to the software deployment network, but access is limited to read-only versions of device software applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
Physical access to the Medtronic 2090 CareLink Programmer is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have physical access to the Medtronic 2090 CareLink Programmer.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger advisory that includes other vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-5448 and CVE-2018-10596) found in the Medtronic CareLink Programmer.
- While the primary attack vector is physical access, the advisory also notes that a subset of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable.
- The advisory mentions that Medtronic has implemented mitigations, including integrity checks and server-side security changes.
- Initially, a network-based software update mechanism was re-enabled after mitigations were deployed. However, it was later disabled due to the discovery of the vulnerability described in section 4.2.3 and users are advised to get updates via controlled USB dongles.
