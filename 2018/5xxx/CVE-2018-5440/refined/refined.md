Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the CODESYS web server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). This occurs when a crafted request exceeds the allocated buffer size in the web server's memory.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the following:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the target device.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The web server could crash, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via a network request, likely over HTTP due to it being a web server vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network requests to the vulnerable web server. The exploit does not require any authentication or user interaction.
    *   The advisory notes that it requires a "low skill level to exploit"
