Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and CSRF protection in the "responsive-coming-soon-page" WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied data submitted via POST requests to the plugin's settings page isn't sufficiently filtered, allowing the injection of malicious code. Additionally, the absence of CSRF tokens allows attackers to trigger the vulnerable actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several input fields within the plugin's settings page are vulnerable to stored XSS. This includes fields such as `coming-soon_title`, `coming-soon_sub_title`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`, `bg_color`, `button_text_link`, `social_icon_1`, `counter_title_icon`, and `counter_title`. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these fields, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when the affected page is loaded, in most cases by a logged in administrator. The code injection is achieved by adding attributes such as `onfocus`, `autofocus` and `test` to the input fields

2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin lacks CSRF protection, meaning that an attacker can create malicious HTML pages that trick a logged-in administrator into submitting requests that modify the plugin settings. This is done by creating a form that automatically submits the vulnerable POST request. The CSRF is used to trigger the stored XSS and the proof of concept demonstrates how this can be done by modifying the social icon parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking (cookie theft).
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Administrative privilege escalation if an admin is targeted.
*   **CSRF:** Successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability can lead to:
    *   Unauthorised modification of the plugin settings (such as injecting the XSS payload).
    *   Other malicious actions that the admin can perform via the plugin's settings page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable input fields in the admin settings of the plugin.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page, typically hosted on a different domain, containing a form that automatically submits a request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page. This requires the targeted administrator to visit the malicious page while logged into the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin's settings page and to modify the vulnerable input fields by logging in to the wordpress admin panel.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page, and to trick a logged in administrator to visit the page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report indicates that the vulnerability was tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the "responsive-coming-soon-page" plugin at the time of the report.
*   The proof-of-concept (POC) code provided clearly illustrates the attack flow and the injection of the malicious JavaScript.
*   The report highlights the combination of CSRF and XSS. The CSRF vulnerability is used to make a logged-in admin save the XSS payload.
