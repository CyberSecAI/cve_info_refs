The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `gd-rating-system` WordPress plugin.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Multiple instances of reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present in different admin pages of the plugin.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `panel` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization on the `panel` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with injected JavaScript in the `panel` parameter and tricks a victim into accessing it.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince an authenticated admin user to click a malicious link.

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: Multiple instances of LFI vulnerabilities exist in different admin pages of the plugin.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `panel` parameter in the URL is used to construct a file path to include using `include()` function, and is not properly validated, allowing directory traversal.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation on the `panel` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive data, such as source code, configuration files, or database credentials.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with directory traversal sequences in the `panel` parameter to include files outside the intended directory.
    *    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince an authenticated admin user to click a malicious link, or needs to be able to directly access the affected URLs.

**Specific vulnerable files and code snippets:**

*   `/forms/information.php`: Affected by both XSS and LFI via `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-information&panel=...`
*   `/forms/about.php`: Affected by both XSS and LFI via `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-about&panel=...`
*  `/forms/transfer.php`: Affected by both XSS and LFI via `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-transfer&panel=...`
*   `/forms/tools.php`: Affected by both XSS and LFI via `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-tools&panel=...`
*   **Vulnerable code:** `include(GDRTS_PATH.'forms/panels/'.$_panel.'.php');`

**Affected versions:**

*   WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the `gd-rating-system` plugin at the time of the report.
