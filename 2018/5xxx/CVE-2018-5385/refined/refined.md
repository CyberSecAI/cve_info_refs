Based on the provided information:

**CVE-2018-5385**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Navarino Infinity web interface is vulnerable to session fixation attacks. The session ID is accepted as a GET parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation. The session ID, passed as a GET parameter, is not changed after login.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a phishing attack by using a known phpsessid to log in as another user, potentially bypassing two-factor authentication in some installations. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially sensitive data. It can be chained with other vulnerabilities (like SQL Injection) to gain access to other user accounts or data.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can obtain a valid session ID and then trick a user into using that session ID via a malicious link or other phishing methods.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of a valid session ID, which can be obtained through various methods (e.g., sniffing, previous access). They would also need to trick the user into using the crafted URL with the attacker's session id.

The provided information includes more details than the CVE description (which is a placeholder). It clarifies that the session ID is passed as a GET parameter and provides the details of the session fixation vulnerability and its impact. It also highlights the possibility of bypassing 2-factor authentication.
