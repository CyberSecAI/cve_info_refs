# [Review: The Bellroy Lite Sling – My Perfect Daily Companion](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/review-the-bellroy-lite-sling-my-perfect-daily-companion/)

Veröffentlicht am [28. Juli 2024](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/review-the-bellroy-lite-sling-my-perfect-daily-companion/ "22:01")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

When I first laid eyes on the **[Bellroy Lite Sling](https://amzn.to/46tALNl)**, I was drawn to its sleek design and promise of practicality. After using it daily for the past few weeks, I can confidently say that this sling has exceeded my expectations in every way. Here’s a detailed review of my experience with the Bellroy Lite Sling and why it has become an indispensable part of my daily routine.

[![](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bellroy-1024x543.jpg)](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bellroy-scaled.jpg)

Bellroy Sling

## Design and Build Quality

One of the first things I noticed about the Bellroy Lite Sling is its minimalist yet stylish design. It’s crafted from durable, lightweight materials that feel nice. Despite its compact size, the sling offers ample space, making it perfect for carrying all my daily essentials without feeling bulky or cumbersome. I have used a slightly smaller pouch before that ran out of space on a regular base.

## Organization and Storage

With multiple compartments, it allows me to neatly organize my belongings. Here’s a quick rundown of what I typically carry:

* **Wallet and Keys**: The main compartment has a dedicated slot for my wallet and a key clip to keep my keys secure and easy to find.
* **Sunglasses**: There’s a soft-lined pocket that keeps sunglasses scratch-free which I do not really use since I am using folding sunglasses that come with their own compartment.
* **Portable Charger and Cables**: The internal mesh pockets are ideal for holding my portable charger and cables, preventing them from tangling.
* **Miscellaneous Items**: From hand sanitizer to FFP2 masks, there’s room for all the little extras I need throughout the day.

## Comfort and Usability

The adjustable strap allows for a custom fit, and the sling can be worn comfortably across the chest or back. The lightweight design ensures that even when fully loaded, it never feels heavy or uncomfortable. Plus, the quick-release buckle makes it easy to take off and put on, which is especially handy when I’m on the go. It can also be attached to a stroller pretty easy.

## Not ideal

The zipper is made so that it can be opened from two sides, which in some cases is very practical, but it also means it is never fully closed on the sides, so heavy rain might cause the insight to get some water, but it did not really happen to me during the time.

## Final Thoughts

I would buy this item again, it is also not that expensive to other bags, at the moment it sells for 50 € (now it seems to be 99 Euro on <https://amzn.to/46tALNl>), a very fair price for such a high quality item.

# [Grey screen starting Lightroom problem](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/grey-screen-starting-lightroom-problem/)

Veröffentlicht am [5. Juli 2023](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/grey-screen-starting-lightroom-problem/ "08:42")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

If you see above grey screen after starting Lightroom Classic, there might be some pointers what to do.

## Try to re-install

The first attempt to solve the problem should be to re-install the software.

## Log file

Have a look at the following log file

```
~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Lightroom CC/lrcc_console.log
```

In my case the following error showed up:

```
ERROR: Failed to create directory (/Users/foobar/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/), errno 2, parent directory (/Users/foobar/Library/Application Support/Adobe/) has permissions 40755
*** GPU Error: Cannot get GPU Host App directory ***
2023-07-05 09:17:39.902 Adobe Lightroom[5676:61231] initializing Camera Raw: dng_error_unknown
0: global error - C
1: [unnamed] - 1250880549:121+7
2: [unnamed] - C
3: global pcall - C
```

Solution was to remove the Adobe folder in „~/Library/Application Support/“ and re-install. The problem was gone.

Happy editing.

If you run the free Mandiant Redline tool and try to copy a line and it is generating the error:

> Operation Failed
>
> OpenClipboard Failed (Exception from HRESULT: …..(CLIPBRD\_E\_CANT\_OPEN))

It might be worth to deactivate the Shared clipboard in your Windows VM.

You are very likely visiting that site because you typed [vlc.zip](https://vlc.zip) somewhere. Similar to [setup.zip](https://setup.zip) I registered the domain to prevent harm to users.

In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, staying ahead of malicious actors and protecting users from potential threats is of paramount importance. To combat the risks associated with hosting malicious content related to [VLC media player](https://videolan.org), have taken a commendable step by launching [VLC.zip](https://vlc.zip)—a domain specifically designed to safeguard users from potential security vulnerabilities. With the recent introduction of .zip as a new top-level domain (TLD) a potential risk was introduced.

Preventing Malicious Intent and Impersonation

The introduction of VLC.zip not only serves as a protective measure against malicious hosting but also acts as a deterrent for impersonation attempts. Cybercriminals often exploit well-known software names to deceive users into downloading harmful files or falling victim to phishing attacks. VLC.zip also redirecting to this blogpost improves awareness.

What can you do? Talk to your sysadmin and consider to block the toplevel domain .zip. Install a AV software and keep all your software up to date.

# [setup.zip](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/setup-zip/)

The internet has seen a lot of changes in recent years, and one of the most significant changes has been the introduction of new top-level domains (TLDs). These new TLDs have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for website owners, but they have also created new challenges, particularly in terms of protecting users from malicious actors. One of the newest TLDs is .zip, and in this blog post, we’ll discuss how to register a .zip domain and set it up to protect users from malicious actors.

First, it’s important to understand what a TLD is. A top-level domain is the part of a domain name that comes after the final dot, such as „.com“ or „.org“. Traditionally, there have been a limited number of TLDs available, but in recent years, ICANN (the organization responsible for managing the internet’s domain name system) has been introducing new TLDs to increase choice and competition.

The .zip TLD is one of the newest TLDs, and it’s designed specifically for websites that deal with compressed files. The idea is that by using a .zip domain, website owners can signal to users that their site is a trustworthy source of compressed files.

In May 2023, Google wrote a blogpost about the newest toplevel domains:

* `.dad`
* .esq
* .prof
* .phd
* .nexus
* .foo
* .zip
* .mov

Especially the .zip can cause problems. That is why I went ahead and registered „[setup.zip](http://setup.zip)“ assuming it is part of many typos and pages. This blog will be the redirect destination for everyone attempting to access „[setup.zip](http://setup.zip)“ if you have other good research ideas what to do with the domain, reach out via twitter on @alexanderjaeger.

# [Recommendation: curate a list of speaking engagements](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/recommendation-curate-a-list-of-speaking-engagements/)

Veröffentlicht am [29. November 2022](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/recommendation-curate-a-list-of-speaking-engagements/ "12:55")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/recommendation-curate-a-list-of-speaking-engagements/#respond)

Something I learned from [HalvarFlake in 2019](https://twitter.com/halvarflake/status/1125026461776265221) that it can be quite painful to remember what conference one spoke in the past.

Giving a talk at a conference, event or appearing on a podcast is a big service for the community, who can learn from your experience. At the same time it is a testament to your impact and something to be proud of. It is cool to look back where you spoke 5 years ago and what topics you found relevant back then.

Such a list can be useful when **trying to get a new job** or to get **more attention from hiring managers**. It can serve to **show your expertise in a specific field**. Last but not least **it can help future program committees** in a paper review process to see your speaking abilities (if the review is not done blindly).

It also can prevent or **reduce the risk of burnout**. Seeing how much you spoke in the past gives you the ability to reflect the workload, additional workload added by preparing a talk which is usually forgotten when agreeing to speak. If you felt comfortable giving 5 talks a year, you might be well off giving 6. Agreeing on 15 however might be a big step up and should be done very carefully.

Since then I capture my speaking at a page of [my page](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/projekte/). I recommend you do the same every 6 months.

## Items I recommend to capture:

* Date of talk / podcast
* Conference title
* Talk title
* Link to slides if available
* Link to a recording if available
* Link to blogpost from others covering your talk

# [#FIRSTCTI22 FIRST CTI Event Berlin 2022 Review](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/firstcti22-first-cti-event-berlin-2022-review/)

Veröffentlicht am [9. November 2022](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/firstcti22-first-cti-event-berlin-2022-review/ "11:34")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/firstcti22-first-cti-event-berlin-2022-review/#respond)

It is November 9th 2022 and I had a few days to digest and think about the FIRST CTI event taking place in Berlin from 2022-11-01 to 2022-11-03.

You can find more direct feedback and impressions on Twitter with the hashtag #FIRSTCTI22 where I also shared stuff.

The program is published at <https://www.first.org/events/symposium/berlin2022/program>. So let’s dive into my thoughts.

To give some context, I participated in the first FIRST CTI, called [FIRST Technical Colloquium on Threat Intelligence](https://www.first.org/events/colloquia/munich2016/), hosted by Siemens in 2016. Back then the topic was very new (remember STIX/CybOX, Mantis). But some topics were relevant already back then like how to operationalize Threat Intelligence and how to evaluate information. It was great then and I was excited to see what has changed since then.

## Training

As I only arrived on Tuesday, I had to skip the trainings, but I was able to talk to participants with mixed impression, which is no surprise given the different roles / background of the participants (more on that later) so I hope many of them provide feedback to the event team so they can extract the right learnings on which training is best suited for the audience.

## Wednesday

I had the honor to moderate the Wednesday, so while I was able to hear all talks, I had to also focus on logistics, take time and have some questions ready for the speakers. To my surprise the audience did not take that much advantage of the fact that we were all in one room and asked very few questions. Maybe this is something which we need to re-learn after the pandemic?

I really liked the talk from James Chappell „*Ten Years of Cyber Threat Intelligence: Retrospectives*“. It was a perfect entry and set the stage for the two following days and for sure James is a veteran in the field, so there were several observations that stuck with me.

Next up was another highlight for me: „*Crossing the Cyber Sad Gap*“ from Jake Nicastro. Jake went into the risk of our jobs and how it can affect the mental health and offered some points to take home and address in your team, very eye opening and I am sad that this talk will not be made available to the public.

Another thing I want to highlight is the mixture at the event between practitioners and academia, Clemens Sauerwein from the University of Innsbruck, Department of Computer Science, AT presented on stage and there were several delegates who were really interested in conversation with industry and public sector people.

Obviously I was nervous giving my own talk together with tomchop, but I think it went really well.

Overall Wednesday was a really pleasant mixture of topics.

## Audience

Overall the audience was a little over **330 delegates**. From conversations I would assume around 40 % with a DFIR background, 40 % from CTI related roles and 20 % either a mixture or something else, but I guess the organizers have better stats on this.

The size of the audience felt ideal for me as well. There were enough people to run into random people to start a conversation but it was not too large to get lost, I think sub 400 is ideal.

There were delegates from all kinds of regions, with a majority coming from Europe, which is not a surprise given the event location. To build a reputation I would like to see the event happen again in Berlin, if there is demand to have something similar in other regions like AMER or APAC, I would suggest building local forks vs. Rotating over the planet like FIRST does for the annual conference. That should also make it easier for the planning team to figure out logistics, but again is my personal opinion and there are also advantages for changing locations.

## Length

Personally I prefer events under three days. Longer events make me tired and come with too much social toll for me. Two days still enable follow up and enough opportunities to have conversations going a little deeper then „hey my name is John Doe, I work at XYZ, nice to meet you“ and then never see that person again.

## Thursday

Started with another excellent talk about the human aspect of our industry „*Why Your Security Analysts Are Leaving and What You Can Do to Retain Them*“ by Thomas Kinsella, I highly recommend this talk.

I skipped one talk that was pre-recorded and instead spent my time networking with delegates, as I hope to see the talk afterwards on YouTube instead.

It is always nice to see new tools announced at events, same here, when „ORKL: Building an Archive for Threat Intelligence History“ was covered by Robert Haist. Solid talk and I recommend checking out the project web page and reaching out to Robert if you want to help the project.

The rest of the talks were all solid but I do not want to bother you with all my thoughts, I have provided feedback to the events team and I recommend you doing the same (check your mails for the survey).

The program committee did an excellent job setting up a program that catered for technical and strategic folks. Kudos: @thomasschreck\_ , @adulau , @asfakian, James Chappell and Dr. Morton Swimmer.

## Dinner

An important aspect of such events for me is to meet with old friends but also make new connections and introduce new people to the community. This time I tried to execute something I learned from Kate.

I made (or asked someone to make one) reservation in a restaurant nearby for 6-8 people, asked 2-4 people I already know and want to see again and added people I wanted to meet for a long time and or folks who asked to be introduced.

The result: a great combination of nice food, excellent group sizes to have different topics to talk about but not too large that it would go nowhere or someone would feel lost (at least I hope).

The absolute highlight for me was going to [C-Base](https://c-base.org/), if you have never heard about it, make sure to check it out, I will not spoil it here. Thanks Y.W. For your hospitality my friend.

## Wish

If I had one wish for the future of that event, I would hope to have a more **diverse** audience and speakers. We as the community need to push more and improve.

## Disclaimer

I have not been involved in the planning of the event other than setting a draft budget in November / December 2021 as part of the normal FIRST budgeting process. And above is purely my personal opinion on things.

# [API of the month: MISP](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. Juli 2021](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/ "15:20")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/#respond)

MISP is a very well known tool in the infosec community that enables individuals and teams to work and share indicators and other case relevant information.

The MISP API comes for free with every MISP installation of the free and open source software, so if you want to try it out, go for it. There are [various install guides](https://www.misp-project.org/download/) for MISP.

Once your MISP instance is up and running, you can head over to the [MISP API documentation](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/).

## Search

Among all endpoints I did use the [Search](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/#search) endpoint the most. This endpoint can be used to search all your MISP data. You can either just pass a string and search everything, or you filter by dedicates types. The query can be as complicated as you want it to be. Be careful with just value searches, depending on your data size, the requests might take a while to complete.

## Get events

Another very useful thing after your searched is then [pull the events](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/#get-events) that matched your search. This can be helpful to provide more context to analysts who started the search.

## PyMisp

When writing about the MISP API, it is important to mention [pyMISP](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/pymisp/), the Python library to access the MISP REST API. It is maintained by the same people behind MISP, so it is kind of a reference implementation of the API and is very easy to use.

## Target audience

The target audience for the MISP API is researchers, students, DFIR professionals and everyone who has a need to store and query structured data around events.

## Example 1

As an example, I have a script that can be a subroutine of an abuse handling process where the input is the name of the organisation an IP belongs to (based on Whois) the script is tasked to find a suitable responsible party who can deal with abuse handling.

## Example 2

Second example, the input is a country, that might be revealed by using whois data for a particular IP, triaging the source to a specific country. The lookup should return a suitable national incident response team to assist in abuse handling.

## Target audience

* Incident responders who want to automate notification or lookup of peer teams
* abuse handlers to lookup responsible CERT / CSIRTs or national Incident Response teams

# CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

Most look like the following:

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

```
CVSS Base Score:3.4
Impact Subscore:1.4
Exploitability Subscore:1.7
CVSS Temporal Score:3.1
CVSS Environmental Score:3.1
Modified Impact Subscore:1.4
Overall CVSS Score:3.1

```
# Responsible disclosure process

## October 25, 2018 14:42 created issue with Rapid 7 online portal / Mail to Circl.lu

So I found the issue and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and have a CVE assigned, my first reaction was to reach out to my friends from CIRCL.lu to assist and assign a CVE, so I sent them a pgp encrypted mail to info@circl.lu.

Side-note: By accident I had a local mail rule, filtering out all mails from info@circl.lu to a sub folder and marked them as read, that is a stupid thing to do if you expect an answer from them and caused some confusion afterwards, so for clarification, they were very responsive and their reaction time is in hours, so if you do not know who to disclosure with a 3rd party, CIRCL is a great way to get it started and they have a profound network of contact points.

Then I looked on rapid 7 webpage and found that they have a responsible disclosure statement and procedure in place as well so I gave it a shot with opening an issue there.

The portal is very well done and requesting information that are good for engineers to assess the impact as fast as possible, it is even possible to propose a CVSS rating (more to that later)

## October 26, 2018 First reaction of Rapid7

Rapid7 gave a SYN / ACK to have received the issue and that Engineering and Support is working on scoping and verifying the issue.

## October 26, 2018 Rapid7 verifies it is an issue

On the same day the designated person made a note in the online portal to verify it is an issue and that they are working on fixing it.

## October 30,2018 Rapid7 case update

Note on the online portal, Rapid 7 team is working on a fix and providing a rough timeline that a patch should be available the same week and that assigning an CVE is in progress as well.

## November 1,2018 Rapid 7 case update

Another note that fix is on the horizon

## November 1,2018 Komand Release Notes

On that day a Mail was sent out announcing a new version „Komand Release Notes“. In the Bug fixes area this was mentioned:

> v0.42.0: Certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response. We fixed this issue, and all configurations of connection data are now correctly obscured.

## November 1,2018 Komand slack

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

In this mail I was told the pre assigned CVE for the issue and the CVSS rating their engineering team came up with. They also asked if I plan to write a blog post or other coverage (which you can read at the moment).

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is notably that the online form used by Rapid7 is supporting this process a lot, I assume it makes it easy to scope issues on engineering site as well as easy for the researcher who wants to know what the current status of the reported issue is.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.

# [API of the month: MISP](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. Juli 2021](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/ "15:20")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-misp/#respond)

MISP is a very well known tool in the infosec community that enables individuals and teams to work and share indicators and other case relevant information.

The MISP API comes for free with every MISP installation of the free and open source software, so if you want to try it out, go for it. There are [various install guides](https://www.misp-project.org/download/) for MISP.

Once your MISP instance is up and running, you can head over to the [MISP API documentation](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/).

## Search

Among all endpoints I did use the [Search](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/#search) endpoint the most. This endpoint can be used to search all your MISP data. You can either just pass a string and search everything, or you filter by dedicates types. The query can be as complicated as you want it to be. Be careful with just value searches, depending on your data size, the requests might take a while to complete.

## Get events

Another very useful thing after your searched is then [pull the events](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/automation/#get-events) that matched your search. This can be helpful to provide more context to analysts who started the search.

## PyMisp

When writing about the MISP API, it is important to mention [pyMISP](https://www.circl.lu/doc/misp/pymisp/), the Python library to access the MISP REST API. It is maintained by the same people behind MISP, so it is kind of a reference implementation of the API and is very easy to use.

## Target audience

The target audience for the MISP API is researchers, students, DFIR professionals and everyone who has a need to store and query structured data around events.

## Example 1

As an example, I have a script that can be a subroutine of an abuse handling process where the input is the name of the organisation an IP belongs to (based on Whois) the script is tasked to find a suitable responsible party who can deal with abuse handling.

## Example 2

Second example, the input is a country, that might be revealed by using whois data for a particular IP, triaging the source to a specific country. The lookup should return a suitable national incident response team to assist in abuse handling.

## Target audience

* Incident responders who want to automate notification or lookup of peer teams
* abuse handlers to lookup responsible CERT / CSIRTs or national Incident Response teams

# [API of the month – apility](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-apility/)

Veröffentlicht am [31. Mai 2019](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-apility/ "08:08")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/api-of-the-month-apility/#respond)

A friend of mine pitched the idea to start a blog series titled „API of the month“ based on my GitHub repository <https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis>.

The idea of that series is to cover an API each month, provide some samples, talk about potential target audience and use cases for the API.

## Service description

The first API to be covered is **apility**. The service is marketed as „Minimal and Simple Anti-Abuse API for Everyone.“ and the web page starts with a Google-like search mask.

![](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/apility_screenshot-1024x560.png)

## API documentation

The API documentation is pretty comprehensive and available via web page: <https://apility.io/apidocs/>. The documentation also gives nice curl examples for every API endpoint that can be copy-pasted.

![](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/apility_api_documentation-1024x481.png)

apility APi documentation

## API pricing

The API itself is free but is limited in regards to API calls that can be done. pricing options are available on <https://apility.io/pricing/>

## Example

As an example I tried to get ratings for IPs / domains for a recent APT OSINT report.

To get started you need to sign up and verify your account via an email that you receive shortly after signing up.

I took the tweet from the [malwrhunterteam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1126894905668849664): <https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1126894905668849664> to test my scripts and also the famous trafficconverter(.)biz

Especially the trafficconverter domain was listed by the tool:

{„response“: {„domain“: {„blacklist“: [„ISC-DOMAINS-LOW“, „ISC-DOMAINS-MEDIUM“], „blacklist\_mx“: [], „blacklist\_ns“: [], „mx“: [], „ns“: [], „score“: -1}, „ip“: {„address“: „38.102.150.28“, „blacklist“: [], „is\_quarantined“: false, „score“: 0}, „source\_ip“: {„address“: „“, „blacklist“: [], „is\_quarantined“: false, „score“: 0}, „score“: -1}, „type“: „baddomain“}

The scripts I used are available on github:

```
import requests
from configparser import ConfigParser

config = ConfigParser()
config.read("config.cfg")
APIKEy = config.get('API', 'APIKEY')
print(APIKEy)

url = "https://api.apility.net/baddomain/"

headers = {
    'accept': "application/json",
    'x-auth-token': APIKEy
    }

f = open('./input.txt', 'r')
for line in f.readlines():
  print("Will investigate "+line)
  response = requests.request("GET", url+line, headers=headers, verify=False)

  print(response.text)

print("finished")
```

It should be noted that there is also a python package available at <https://github.com/Apilityio/python-cli> and can be installed (but I have not tested it) via:

```
pip install apilityio-cli
```

or

```
easy_install apilityio-cli
```
## Target audience

The target audience for the API as well as the service is:

* sysadmins who want to use the offered data to sharpen perimeter security tools
* Researchers to add more data points to their research
* Threat Intelligence professionals as a data source
* Incident responders to monitor if any of the ASN / domains they are responsible for is added to one of the blacklists

# [CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/#respond)

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

```
CVSS Base Score:3.4
Impact Subscore:1.4
Exploitability Subscore:1.7
CVSS Temporal Score:3.1
CVSS Environmental Score:3.1
Modified Impact Subscore:1.4
Overall CVSS Score:3.1

```
# Responsible disclosure process

## October 25, 2018 14:42 created issue with Rapid 7 online portal / Mail to Circl.lu

So I found the issue and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and have a CVE assigned, my first reaction was to reach out to my friends from CIRCL.lu to assist and assign a CVE, so I sent them a pgp encrypted mail to info@circl.lu.

Side-note: By accident I had a local mail rule, filtering out all mails from info@circl.lu to a sub folder and marked them as read, that is a stupid thing to do if you expect an answer from them and caused some confusion afterwards, so for clarification, they were very responsive and their reaction time is in hours, so if you do not know who to disclosure with a 3rd party, CIRCL is a great way to get it started and they have a profound network of contact points.

Then I looked on rapid 7 webpage and found that they have a responsible disclosure statement and procedure in place as well so I gave it a shot with opening an issue there.

The portal is very well done and requesting information that are good for engineers to assess the impact as fast as possible, it is even possible to propose a CVSS rating (more to that later)

## October 26, 2018 First reaction of Rapid7

Rapid7 gave a SYN / ACK to have received the issue and that Engineering and Support is working on scoping and verifying the issue.

## October 26, 2018 Rapid7 verifies it is an issue

On the same day the designated person made a note in the online portal to verify it is an issue and that they are working on fixing it.

## October 30,2018 Rapid7 case update

Note on the online portal, Rapid 7 team is working on a fix and providing a rough timeline that a patch should be available the same week and that assigning an CVE is in progress as well.

## November 1,2018 Rapid 7 case update

Another note that fix is on the horizon

## November 1,2018 Komand Release Notes

On that day a Mail was sent out announcing a new version „Komand Release Notes“. In the Bug fixes area this was mentioned:

> v0.42.0: Certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response. We fixed this issue, and all configurations of connection data are now correctly obscured.

## November 1,2018 Komand slack

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.

# [timesketch-tools](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/timesketch-tools/)

Veröffentlicht am [31. Oktober 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/timesketch-tools/ "15:10")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/timesketch-tools/#respond)

# Overview

I am happy to say that a new tool made it to github called „timesketch-tools“.

# Reason

Back in 2017, Johan tweeted:

> Do you want to build automation around forensic timeline analysis? try: pip install timesketch-api-client [#DFIR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DFIR?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
>
> — Johan (@jberggren) [15. August 2017](https://twitter.com/jberggren/status/897403015061221382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Why is the WebUi not enough? Well in some cases you might want to automate stuff, have no browser or other reasons, so it is not „Why“ but „why not“.

So I did during the last few days and built a client for it: [timesketch-tools](https://github.com/deralexxx/timesketch-tools)

# Capabilities

At the moment only two methods do work, but it should be enough to show the power of it.

## List sketches

```
timesketch-tools.py -ls

         _______               __       __      __
        /_  __(_)_ _  ___ ___ / /_____ / /_____/ /
         / / / /  ' \/ -_|_-</  '_/ -_) __/ __/ _
        /_/ /_/_/_/_/\__/___/_/\_\__/\__/\__/_//_/-tools v0.1

+-----+-----------------------------+
|  id |             Name            |
+-----+-----------------------------+
| 130 |     test1Untitled sketch    |
|  3  | The Greendale investigation |
+-----+-----------------------------+

```
## Add event

```
timesketch-tools.py --add_events

         _______               __       __      __
        /_  __(_)_ _  ___ ___ / /_____ / /_____/ /
         / / / /  ' \/ -_|_-</  '_/ -_) __/ __/ _
        /_/ /_/_/_/_/\__/___/_/\_\__/\__/\__/_//_/-tools v0.1

Please provide the sketch id you want to add events to as (an integer): 3
Please provide informations to the event you would like to add timestamp, timestamp_desc, message will be promted

Timestamp (use Format: YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS+00:00 2018-01-15T10:45:50+00:00) use c for current time c
timestamp_desc this is the description
message something was hacked
Event added, ID: 18 Date:2018-10-31T14:49:41+00:00 timestamp desc this is the description messagesomething was hacked
Add another event? (y/n)n

```

I have a lot of ideas to improve, so expect some more functionality added soon…

# Problem

Sometimes you might want to authenticate against an API with username and password where examples are only listed with curl:

# Solution

If you want to implement the same in python you can use the following

request\_url = "https://127.0.0.1/foobar"

result = requests.post(request\_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))

Hope it helps, let me know

# [Security API collection](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/)

Veröffentlicht am [13. Januar 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/ "18:12")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/#respond)

While working on different stuff I was searching for a collection of APIs that are related of useful for security researchers, incident response people or threat intel.

Unable to find a good list of REST APIs decided to start it. The collection is hosted on a [Security API list](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis/), and pull requests or issues mentioning missing APIs are highly welcome.

Why did I produce such a list? More and more people want to automate their workflows, Security Orchestration is the new Buzzword after last years Threat Intelligence, but basically containing the same, they both have in common to facilitate already available data, with Orchestration not storing that much data but enriching dots collected.

However the challenge is, what to integrate, everyone has their „go to“ tools they use on a daily base risking to miss some golden nuggets that are handy.

The list is divided (at the moment) in tools that are mostly on prem., online tools, SIEMs and various. With an increasing number of APIs that ordering might change of course.

So I really hope the list is useful and people can use it and that it can grow.

# [Infos zu einer App: Version – Sprache](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/infos-zu-einer-app-version-sprache/)

Veröffentlicht am [10. Mai 2011](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/infos-zu-einer-app-version-sprache/ "19:11")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/infos-zu-einer-app-version-sprache/#respond)

Eine App für eine breite Kundschaft zu entwickeln bedeutet auch, eine Vielzahl an Variationen von Problemmöglichkeiten zu kreieren. Wenn dann wirklich ein Problem auftritt, möchte man vom Kunden möglichst genau dessen Rahmenbediengungen kennen.

Dazu zählt bei einer iOS App insbesondere:

## Quelle:

Welche App hat er genau genutzt?

## Version:

Welche Version der App wurde verwendet? Wurde evtl. eine alte Version genutzt und ein reines Update würde helfen?

## Sprache:

Welche Sprache ist eingestellt? Kommt das Problem evtl. von einem Übersetzungsfehler / einer fehlenden Übersetzung?

## iOS Version:

Apple verhindert zwar recht gut, Funktionen zu verwenden, die in bestimmten iOS Versionen noch nicht oder nicht mehr verfügbar sind, nichts desto trotz, ist es bei Fehlern wichtig, zu wissen, welche iOS Version verwendet wird.

Die meisten der Informationen sind über **[[NSBundle mainbundle] infoDictionary]** erreichbar:

*App Identifier*: **[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] valueForKey:@“CFBundleIdentifier“]**

*App Version*: **[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary] valueForKey:@“CFBundleVersion“]**

Die *Sprache* erhält man über: **[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@“AppleLanguages“] objectAtIndex:0]**

Und zu guter letzt die *iOS Version*:

**[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] operatingSystemVersionString]** Hierbei ist darauf zu achten, dass im Simulator als Betriebssystem die OSX Version angegeben wird.

Mit den aufgeführten Angaben lässt sich schon recht genau das technische Umfeld des Nutzers eingrenzen und diese Informationen können automatisch beispielsweise in einer E-Mail angehängt werden.

Dabei bietet es sich an, die ankommenden E-Mails automatisch in ein Ticket System laufen zu lassen um auch keine Meldung zu vergessen. Als praktisch hat sich hierbei die OpenSource Ticket Verwaltung [OTRS](https://www.otrs.com/software/otrs-help-desk-features/ "OTRS Open Ticket Relay System") erwiesen. Auch für den professionellen Einsatz lohnt sich das System, da hinter den Entwicklern eine Firma steckt, die auch professionellen Support anbietet und Unterstützung bei der Umsetzung anbieten kann.

# timesketch-tools

Veröffentlicht am [31. Oktober 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/timesketch-tools/ "15:10")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

# Overview

I am happy to say that a new tool made it to github called „timesketch-tools“.

It is basically a way to interact with Timesketch via CLI. For those who don’t know Timesketch, it is an amazing opensource tool developed by Johan Berggren and is used to create timelines for forensic investigations as well as incident response cases.

# Reason

Back in 2017, Johan tweeted:

> Do you want to build automation around forensic timeline analysis? try: pip install timesketch-api-client [#DFIR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DFIR?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
>
> — Johan (@jberggren) [15. August 2017](https://twitter.com/jberggren/status/897403015061221382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Why is the WebUi not enough? Well in some cases you might want to automate stuff, have no browser or other reasons, so it is not „Why“ but „why not“.

So I did during the last few days and built a client for it: [timesketch-tools](https://github.com/deralexxx/timesketch-tools)

# Capabilities

At the moment only two methods do work, but it should be enough to show the power of it.

## List sketches

```
timesketch-tools.py -ls

         _______               __       __      __
        /_  __(_)_ _  ___ ___ / /_____ / /_____/ /
         / / / /  ' \/ -_|_-</  '_/ -_) __/ __/ _
        /_/ /_/_/_/_/\__/___/_/\_\__/\__/\__/_//_/-tools v0.1

+-----+-----------------------------+
|  id |             Name            |
+-----+-----------------------------+
| 130 |     test1Untitled sketch    |
|  3  | The Greendale investigation |
+-----+-----------------------------+

```
## Add event

```
timesketch-tools.py --add_events

         _______               __       __      __
        /_  __(_)_ _  ___ ___ / /_____ / /_____/ /
         / / / /  ' \/ -_|_-</  '_/ -_) __/ __/ _
        /_/ /_/_/_/_/\__/___/_/\_\__/\__/\__/_//_/-tools v0.1

Please provide the sketch id you want to add events to as (an integer): 3
Please provide informations to the event you would like to add timestamp, timestamp_desc, message will be promted

Timestamp (use Format: YYYY-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS+00:00 2018-01-15T10:45:50+00:00) use c for current time c
timestamp_desc this is the description
message something was hacked
Event added, ID: 18 Date:2018-10-31T14:49:41+00:00 timestamp desc this is the description messagesomething was hacked
Add another event? (y/n)n

```

I have a lot of ideas to improve, so expect some more functionality added soon…

# vlc.zip

Veröffentlicht am [19. Mai 2023](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/vlc-zip/ "15:35")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

You are very likely visiting that site because you typed [vlc.zip](https://vlc.zip) somewhere. Similar to [setup.zip](https://setup.zip) I registered the domain to prevent harm to users.

In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, staying ahead of malicious actors and protecting users from potential threats is of paramount importance. To combat the risks associated with hosting malicious content related to [VLC media player](https://videolan.org), have taken a commendable step by launching [VLC.zip](https://vlc.zip)—a domain specifically designed to safeguard users from potential security vulnerabilities. With the recent introduction of .zip as a new top-level domain (TLD) a potential risk was introduced.

Preventing Malicious Intent and Impersonation

The introduction of VLC.zip not only serves as a protective measure against malicious hosting but also acts as a deterrent for impersonation attempts. Cybercriminals often exploit well-known software names to deceive users into downloading harmful files or falling victim to phishing attacks. VLC.zip also redirecting to this blogpost improves awareness.

What can you do? Talk to your sysadmin and consider to block the toplevel domain .zip. Install a AV software and keep all your software up to date.

# lnav the log file navigator

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/lnav-the-log-file-navigator/ "19:32")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

This is a recommendation to a tool that I am using since months – the log file navigator.

Who does not know the issue, you have to look at logs from various places and you start with stuff like **more**, **grep**, **cat** etc. or upload it to your ELK, Splunk, QRadar – you name it.

While those tools have their good reason, log files usually have a specific set of requirements to handle effectively. And for that reason use [lnav](http://lnav.org/). The tool enables you to work with your log file(s) locally, offline and effective.

Some quotes:

> Just point **lnav**to a directory and it will take care of the rest.  File formats are automatically detected and compressed files are unpacked on the fly.

The log message format is automatically determined by **lnav** while scanning your files.   The following formats are built in by default:

* Common Web Access Log format
* [CUPS page\_log](http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/doc-1.7/ref-page_log.html)
* Syslog
* Glog
* [VMware ESXi/vCenter Logs](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2004201)
* dpkg.log
* uwsgi
* „Generic“ – Any message that starts with a timestamp
* Strace
* sudo

More features on the [project website.](http://lnav.org/features/)

The best part? **The tool is free!** Yes free as free, so no data is shared with the developer, no shareware, it is free!

It runs on Apple OSX and linux – I am waiting for a Windows version as there is [Linux subsystem support on Windows 10.](https://www.onmsft.com/news/how-to-install-windows-10s-linux-subsystem-on-your-pc)

# Schlagwort-Archive: information disclosure

# [CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/#respond)

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

Most look like the following:

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

```
CVSS Base Score:3.4
Impact Subscore:1.4
Exploitability Subscore:1.7
CVSS Temporal Score:3.1
CVSS Environmental Score:3.1
Modified Impact Subscore:1.4
Overall CVSS Score:3.1

```
# Responsible disclosure process

## October 25, 2018 14:42 created issue with Rapid 7 online portal / Mail to Circl.lu

So I found the issue and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and have a CVE assigned, my first reaction was to reach out to my friends from CIRCL.lu to assist and assign a CVE, so I sent them a pgp encrypted mail to info@circl.lu.

Side-note: By accident I had a local mail rule, filtering out all mails from info@circl.lu to a sub folder and marked them as read, that is a stupid thing to do if you expect an answer from them and caused some confusion afterwards, so for clarification, they were very responsive and their reaction time is in hours, so if you do not know who to disclosure with a 3rd party, CIRCL is a great way to get it started and they have a profound network of contact points.

Then I looked on rapid 7 webpage and found that they have a responsible disclosure statement and procedure in place as well so I gave it a shot with opening an issue there.

The portal is very well done and requesting information that are good for engineers to assess the impact as fast as possible, it is even possible to propose a CVSS rating (more to that later)

## October 26, 2018 First reaction of Rapid7

Rapid7 gave a SYN / ACK to have received the issue and that Engineering and Support is working on scoping and verifying the issue.

## October 26, 2018 Rapid7 verifies it is an issue

On the same day the designated person made a note in the online portal to verify it is an issue and that they are working on fixing it.

## October 30,2018 Rapid7 case update

Note on the online portal, Rapid 7 team is working on a fix and providing a rough timeline that a patch should be available the same week and that assigning an CVE is in progress as well.

## November 1,2018 Rapid 7 case update

Another note that fix is on the horizon

## November 1,2018 Komand Release Notes

On that day a Mail was sent out announcing a new version „Komand Release Notes“. In the Bug fixes area this was mentioned:

> v0.42.0: Certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response. We fixed this issue, and all configurations of connection data are now correctly obscured.

## November 1,2018 Komand slack

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

In this mail I was told the pre assigned CVE for the issue and the CVSS rating their engineering team came up with. They also asked if I plan to write a blog post or other coverage (which you can read at the moment).

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is notably that the online form used by Rapid7 is supporting this process a lot, I assume it makes it easy to scope issues on engineering site as well as easy for the researcher who wants to know what the current status of the reported issue is.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.

### Major New Features

**Introducing Join Paths Step(beta)**

Users can now join multiple paths into a single path!

* Workflow Builder: A new 'Join Paths' step type is now available.
* Workflow Builder: The 'Join Paths' step enables you to define variables which take different values depending on which path was taken to reach the 'Join Paths' step.
* These values include variables defined along the specified path taken.
* All variables from the joined paths must be assigned to 'Join Paths' step variables if one wants to use the values of those variables later on in the workflow.
* Only paths that directly come from the same branching step (Chatbot Response Prompts/Decisions) may be joined together.
* This mean that if a path from a branching step contains a second branching step, no path from the second branching step may be joined with a path from the original branching step.
* Additionally, paths following a 'Join Paths' step may not be joined to paths in parallel decision trees..

**Introducing Individual Step Testing**

* Action steps may now be tested on the Configure Details phase in the Workflow Builder.
* When testing an action step, the user is prompted to provide input for each input variable so that the step may be run.

**Introducing Step Disabling**

* Steps may now be disabled in the workflow builder by clicking on the option next to the step that is an eye with a slash through it.
  + Chatbot Response Prompt, Decision, Loop, Trigger, and End steps may not by disabled.
  + Disabled steps will not run when the workflow is run or tested.
  + Refernces to the variables output by disabled steps are not valid and will throw an error.

**Introducing Rapid7 Styling Changes**

* Rapid7 colors are now applied throughout Komand.
* The login page has been stylistically changed to include Rapid7's logo.
* No functional changes have occured as a result of these style changes.

You are very likely visiting that site because you typed [vlc.zip](https://vlc.zip) somewhere. Similar to [setup.zip](https://setup.zip) I registered the domain to prevent harm to users.

In the ever-evolving landscape of the internet, staying ahead of malicious actors and protecting users from potential threats is of paramount importance. To combat the risks associated with hosting malicious content related to [VLC media player](https://videolan.org), have taken a commendable step by launching [VLC.zip](https://vlc.zip)—a domain specifically designed to safeguard users from potential security vulnerabilities. With the recent introduction of .zip as a new top-level domain (TLD) a potential risk was introduced.

Preventing Malicious Intent and Impersonation

The introduction of VLC.zip not only serves as a protective measure against malicious hosting but also acts as a deterrent for impersonation attempts. Cybercriminals often exploit well-known software names to deceive users into downloading harmful files or falling victim to phishing attacks. VLC.zip also redirecting to this blogpost improves awareness.

What can you do? Talk to your sysadmin and consider to block the toplevel domain .zip. Install a AV software and keep all your software up to date.

The internet has seen a lot of changes in recent years, and one of the most significant changes has been the introduction of new top-level domains (TLDs). These new TLDs have opened up a whole new world of possibilities for website owners, but they have also created new challenges, particularly in terms of protecting users from malicious actors. One of the newest TLDs is .zip, and in this blog post, we’ll discuss how to register a .zip domain and set it up to protect users from malicious actors.

First, it’s important to understand what a TLD is. A top-level domain is the part of a domain name that comes after the final dot, such as „.com“ or „.org“. Traditionally, there have been a limited number of TLDs available, but in recent years, ICANN (the organization responsible for managing the internet’s domain name system) has been introducing new TLDs to increase choice and competition.

The .zip TLD is one of the newest TLDs, and it’s designed specifically for websites that deal with compressed files. The idea is that by using a .zip domain, website owners can signal to users that their site is a trustworthy source of compressed files.

In May 2023, Google wrote a blogpost about the newest toplevel domains:

* `.dad`
* .esq
* .prof
* .phd
* .nexus
* .foo
* .zip
* .mov

Especially the .zip can cause problems. That is why I went ahead and registered „[setup.zip](http://setup.zip)“ assuming it is part of many typos and pages. This blog will be the redirect destination for everyone attempting to access „[setup.zip](http://setup.zip)“ if you have other good research ideas what to do with the domain, reach out via twitter on @alexanderjaeger.

# [CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/#respond)

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

Most look like the following:

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

```
CVSS Base Score:3.4
Impact Subscore:1.4
Exploitability Subscore:1.7
CVSS Temporal Score:3.1
CVSS Environmental Score:3.1
Modified Impact Subscore:1.4
Overall CVSS Score:3.1

```
# Responsible disclosure process

## October 25, 2018 14:42 created issue with Rapid 7 online portal / Mail to Circl.lu

So I found the issue and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and have a CVE assigned, my first reaction was to reach out to my friends from CIRCL.lu to assist and assign a CVE, so I sent them a pgp encrypted mail to info@circl.lu.

Side-note: By accident I had a local mail rule, filtering out all mails from info@circl.lu to a sub folder and marked them as read, that is a stupid thing to do if you expect an answer from them and caused some confusion afterwards, so for clarification, they were very responsive and their reaction time is in hours, so if you do not know who to disclosure with a 3rd party, CIRCL is a great way to get it started and they have a profound network of contact points.

Then I looked on rapid 7 webpage and found that they have a responsible disclosure statement and procedure in place as well so I gave it a shot with opening an issue there.

The portal is very well done and requesting information that are good for engineers to assess the impact as fast as possible, it is even possible to propose a CVSS rating (more to that later)

## October 26, 2018 First reaction of Rapid7

Rapid7 gave a SYN / ACK to have received the issue and that Engineering and Support is working on scoping and verifying the issue.

## October 26, 2018 Rapid7 verifies it is an issue

On the same day the designated person made a note in the online portal to verify it is an issue and that they are working on fixing it.

## October 30,2018 Rapid7 case update

Note on the online portal, Rapid 7 team is working on a fix and providing a rough timeline that a patch should be available the same week and that assigning an CVE is in progress as well.

## November 1,2018 Rapid 7 case update

Another note that fix is on the horizon

## November 1,2018 Komand Release Notes

On that day a Mail was sent out announcing a new version „Komand Release Notes“. In the Bug fixes area this was mentioned:

> v0.42.0: Certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response. We fixed this issue, and all configurations of connection data are now correctly obscured.

## November 1,2018 Komand slack

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

In this mail I was told the pre assigned CVE for the issue and the CVSS rating their engineering team came up with. They also asked if I plan to write a blog post or other coverage (which you can read at the moment).

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is notably that the online form used by Rapid7 is supporting this process a lot, I assume it makes it easy to scope issues on engineering site as well as easy for the researcher who wants to know what the current status of the reported issue is.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.

# [Security API collection](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/)

Veröffentlicht am [13. Januar 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/ "18:12")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/security-api-collection/#respond)

While working on different stuff I was searching for a collection of APIs that are related of useful for security researchers, incident response people or threat intel.

Unable to find a good list of REST APIs decided to start it. The collection is hosted on a [Security API list](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis/), and pull requests or issues mentioning missing APIs are highly welcome.

Why did I produce such a list? More and more people want to automate their workflows, Security Orchestration is the new Buzzword after last years Threat Intelligence, but basically containing the same, they both have in common to facilitate already available data, with Orchestration not storing that much data but enriching dots collected.

However the challenge is, what to integrate, everyone has their „go to“ tools they use on a daily base risking to miss some golden nuggets that are handy.

The list is divided (at the moment) in tools that are mostly on prem., online tools, SIEMs and various. With an increasing number of APIs that ordering might change of course.

So I really hope the list is useful and people can use it and that it can grow.

One day to go till the Backfischfest in Worms is starting and we can say, the [9TageTicket](http://9tageticket.de) this year is again a big success. With more then 650 tickets pre ordered, we are on almost the same level as last year, showing that there is a constant interest in the free tickets that show other visitors the commitment to the Backfischfest.

For the first time we will have flyer for the showman explaining the idea behind 9TageTicket.

Ahoi

The following error message:

```

Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted
More information is available with DEBUG=True

```

Might occur if you are using an apache / nginx running behind another Apache as a proxy.

To read more about CSRF go to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery). It is basically an interception of a session exploiting the trust a browser has to a site.

So it is an security feature, that is interfered by the proxy.

You have most likely something like:

```

ProxyPass / https://$yourhost/
ProxyPassReverse / https://$yourhost/

```

In your apache config. That needs to be extended to:

```

ProxyPass / https://$yourhost/
ProxyPassReverse / https://$yourhost/
ProxyPreserveHost On

```

Quote from [apache doc](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypreservehost):

> When enabled, this option will pass the Host: line from the incoming request to the proxied host, instead of the hostname specified in the ProxyPass line.
>
> This option should normally be turned Off. It is mostly useful in special configurations like proxied mass name-based virtual hosting, where the original Host header needs to be evaluated by the backend server.

# [Amazon Fire TV nun in Deutschland](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/amazon-fire-tv-nun-in-deutschland/)

Da öffnet man Amazon ohne böse Vorahnung und bekommt einen Hinweis:

> Liebe Kunden,

Endlich.

Und noch schöner, bis Montag gibt es das Amazon Fire TV für Amazon Prime Kunden zum Vorzugspreis von 50 Euro statt 99 Euro.

> PS: Das Fire TV bietet neuen und existierenden Prime-Mitgliedern noch mehr. Sie können Tausende beliebte Filme und Serienepisoden mit Prime Instant Video sofort unbegrenzt streamen und erhalten in den nächsten fünf Tagen das Fire TV für nur 49 EUR statt regulär 99 EUR.

Zuschlagen lohnt sich also.

# #FIRSTCTI22 FIRST CTI Event Berlin 2022 Review

Veröffentlicht am [9. November 2022](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/firstcti22-first-cti-event-berlin-2022-review/ "11:34")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")

It is November 9th 2022 and I had a few days to digest and think about the FIRST CTI event taking place in Berlin from 2022-11-01 to 2022-11-03.

You can find more direct feedback and impressions on Twitter with the hashtag #FIRSTCTI22 where I also shared stuff.

The program is published at <https://www.first.org/events/symposium/berlin2022/program>. So let’s dive into my thoughts.

To give some context, I participated in the first FIRST CTI, called [FIRST Technical Colloquium on Threat Intelligence](https://www.first.org/events/colloquia/munich2016/), hosted by Siemens in 2016. Back then the topic was very new (remember STIX/CybOX, Mantis). But some topics were relevant already back then like how to operationalize Threat Intelligence and how to evaluate information. It was great then and I was excited to see what has changed since then.

## Training

As I only arrived on Tuesday, I had to skip the trainings, but I was able to talk to participants with mixed impression, which is no surprise given the different roles / background of the participants (more on that later) so I hope many of them provide feedback to the event team so they can extract the right learnings on which training is best suited for the audience.

## Wednesday

I had the honor to moderate the Wednesday, so while I was able to hear all talks, I had to also focus on logistics, take time and have some questions ready for the speakers. To my surprise the audience did not take that much advantage of the fact that we were all in one room and asked very few questions. Maybe this is something which we need to re-learn after the pandemic?

I really liked the talk from James Chappell „*Ten Years of Cyber Threat Intelligence: Retrospectives*“. It was a perfect entry and set the stage for the two following days and for sure James is a veteran in the field, so there were several observations that stuck with me.

Next up was another highlight for me: „*Crossing the Cyber Sad Gap*“ from Jake Nicastro. Jake went into the risk of our jobs and how it can affect the mental health and offered some points to take home and address in your team, very eye opening and I am sad that this talk will not be made available to the public.

Another thing I want to highlight is the mixture at the event between practitioners and academia, Clemens Sauerwein from the University of Innsbruck, Department of Computer Science, AT presented on stage and there were several delegates who were really interested in conversation with industry and public sector people.

Obviously I was nervous giving my own talk together with tomchop, but I think it went really well.

Overall Wednesday was a really pleasant mixture of topics.

## Audience

Overall the audience was a little over **330 delegates**. From conversations I would assume around 40 % with a DFIR background, 40 % from CTI related roles and 20 % either a mixture or something else, but I guess the organizers have better stats on this.

The size of the audience felt ideal for me as well. There were enough people to run into random people to start a conversation but it was not too large to get lost, I think sub 400 is ideal.

There were delegates from all kinds of regions, with a majority coming from Europe, which is not a surprise given the event location. To build a reputation I would like to see the event happen again in Berlin, if there is demand to have something similar in other regions like AMER or APAC, I would suggest building local forks vs. Rotating over the planet like FIRST does for the annual conference. That should also make it easier for the planning team to figure out logistics, but again is my personal opinion and there are also advantages for changing locations.

## Length

Personally I prefer events under three days. Longer events make me tired and come with too much social toll for me. Two days still enable follow up and enough opportunities to have conversations going a little deeper then „hey my name is John Doe, I work at XYZ, nice to meet you“ and then never see that person again.

## Thursday

Started with another excellent talk about the human aspect of our industry „*Why Your Security Analysts Are Leaving and What You Can Do to Retain Them*“ by Thomas Kinsella, I highly recommend this talk.

I skipped one talk that was pre-recorded and instead spent my time networking with delegates, as I hope to see the talk afterwards on YouTube instead.

It is always nice to see new tools announced at events, same here, when „ORKL: Building an Archive for Threat Intelligence History“ was covered by Robert Haist. Solid talk and I recommend checking out the project web page and reaching out to Robert if you want to help the project.

The rest of the talks were all solid but I do not want to bother you with all my thoughts, I have provided feedback to the events team and I recommend you doing the same (check your mails for the survey).

The program committee did an excellent job setting up a program that catered for technical and strategic folks. Kudos: @thomasschreck\_ , @adulau , @asfakian, James Chappell and Dr. Morton Swimmer.

## Dinner

An important aspect of such events for me is to meet with old friends but also make new connections and introduce new people to the community. This time I tried to execute something I learned from Kate.

I made (or asked someone to make one) reservation in a restaurant nearby for 6-8 people, asked 2-4 people I already know and want to see again and added people I wanted to meet for a long time and or folks who asked to be introduced.

The result: a great combination of nice food, excellent group sizes to have different topics to talk about but not too large that it would go nowhere or someone would feel lost (at least I hope).

The absolute highlight for me was going to [C-Base](https://c-base.org/), if you have never heard about it, make sure to check it out, I will not spoil it here. Thanks Y.W. For your hospitality my friend.

## Wish

If I had one wish for the future of that event, I would hope to have a more **diverse** audience and speakers. We as the community need to push more and improve.

## Disclaimer

I have not been involved in the planning of the event other than setting a draft budget in November / December 2021 as part of the normal FIRST budgeting process. And above is purely my personal opinion on things.

# [CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/#respond)

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

Most look like the following:

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

# Responsible disclosure process

## October 25, 2018 14:42 created issue with Rapid 7 online portal / Mail to Circl.lu

So I found the issue and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and have a CVE assigned, my first reaction was to reach out to my friends from CIRCL.lu to assist and assign a CVE, so I sent them a pgp encrypted mail to info@circl.lu.

Side-note: By accident I had a local mail rule, filtering out all mails from info@circl.lu to a sub folder and marked them as read, that is a stupid thing to do if you expect an answer from them and caused some confusion afterwards, so for clarification, they were very responsive and their reaction time is in hours, so if you do not know who to disclosure with a 3rd party, CIRCL is a great way to get it started and they have a profound network of contact points.

Then I looked on rapid 7 webpage and found that they have a responsible disclosure statement and procedure in place as well so I gave it a shot with opening an issue there.

The portal is very well done and requesting information that are good for engineers to assess the impact as fast as possible, it is even possible to propose a CVSS rating (more to that later)

## October 26, 2018 First reaction of Rapid7

Rapid7 gave a SYN / ACK to have received the issue and that Engineering and Support is working on scoping and verifying the issue.

## October 26, 2018 Rapid7 verifies it is an issue

On the same day the designated person made a note in the online portal to verify it is an issue and that they are working on fixing it.

## October 30,2018 Rapid7 case update

Note on the online portal, Rapid 7 team is working on a fix and providing a rough timeline that a patch should be available the same week and that assigning an CVE is in progress as well.

## November 1,2018 Rapid 7 case update

Another note that fix is on the horizon

## November 1,2018 Komand Release Notes

On that day a Mail was sent out announcing a new version „Komand Release Notes“. In the Bug fixes area this was mentioned:

> v0.42.0: Certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response. We fixed this issue, and all configurations of connection data are now correctly obscured.

## November 1,2018 Komand slack

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

In this mail I was told the pre assigned CVE for the issue and the CVSS rating their engineering team came up with. They also asked if I plan to write a blog post or other coverage (which you can read at the moment).

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is notably that the online form used by Rapid7 is supporting this process a lot, I assume it makes it easy to scope issues on engineering site as well as easy for the researcher who wants to know what the current status of the reported issue is.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.

Veröffentlicht am [26. Oktober 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/komand-tools/ "15:45")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/komand-tools/#respond)

Out of my attempt to reverse engineer the Komand API (a security orchestration tool) I found myself writing some python helper to use the API. Maybe it is useful for some people, so I decided to OpenSource it.

It is hard to understand why a tool, thats main purpose it to connect APIs does not have an API documentation / client itself.

Usage should be pretty simple, clone the repository and good to go:

 `usage: komand-tools.py [-h] [-v] [-wm] [-j JOB]`

optional arguments:

-h, --help show this help message and exit

-v, --verbose increase output verbosity

-wm, --workflow\_map show workflow map

-j JOB, --job JOB show job status

# Schlagwort-Archive: CVE-2018-5559

# [CVE-2018-5559 my first CVE](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/)

Veröffentlicht am [15. November 2018](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/ "14:15")  von  [Alex](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/author/admin/ "Alle Beiträge von Alex anzeigen")
[Antworten](https://www.alexanderjaeger.de/cve-2018-5559_my_first_cve/#respond)

# TLDR

CVE-2018-5559 is a information disclosure security vulnerability in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) that has been disclosed responsibly to Rapid 7 and has been mitigated and patched within days (version >0.42.0). The vulnerability itself is not worth to have a logo.

# Introduction

Being a security professional I happen to hear a lot of people complaining about companies handling responsible disclosure in a way that is not appreciated by customers (by sitting on patches to long) or by the disclosure (by not reacting etc). The following blog post is report about a very positive case that I happen to have by disclosing my very first security vulnerability. I really hope this one is being shared and that companies adopt some of the positive aspects. At the very end of the post I will also try to lead to further points where either researchers or companies can read further about the topic.

# The stage

Being interested in various APIs that are interesting to security people (eventually turning into dedicated list of [APIs on Github](https://github.com/deralexxx/security-apis)) I stumbled across Komand Security Orchestrator. As there was no documentation available (heads up Rapid 7, that fact needs some love!) I spent some time to reverse engineer and discover APIs with Google Chrome developer tools and Python and actively sharing my results on [github](https://github.com/deralexxx/komand-hacks/blob/master/api/README.md).

One of the API endpoints was /connections:

```
https://komandurl/v2/connections

```
# Connections

Komand Security Orchestrator is made to interact with various (security related) tools to interact and create so called workflows. To achieve that goal, Komand needs credentials to those tools. Every set of credentials is stored in a central keychain that is accessible for workflows. Most connections store some kind of URL, Username and password.

Given this nature, credentials stored in this keychain have either higher Privileges to accomplish tasks or are able to see more than the regular user.

Every Plugin can have it’s own set of credentials, so let’s say you have the LDAP plugin to connect to Active directory, there could be a dedicated set of credentials for prod and qual active directory.

# Surprise

After my first GET request to the connection API endpoint something got my attention. While most of the connections have the password field \*\*\*\*\*ed out, some did not – WTH?

Most look like the following:

```
"name":"VT Private API","type":"plugin","parameters":{"api_key":"********","url":"https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/"}

```

But OTRS looks like the following:

```
{"connection_id":36,"plugin_id":75,"name":"OTRS Dev User:komand_test","type":"plugin","parameters":{"server":"https://`EDUCTED","credentials":{"password":"REDUCTED","username":"komand_test"}},"created_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T10:56:54Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```

And LDAP:

```
{"connection_id":39,"plugin_id":72,"name":"ÀD","type":"plugin","parameters":{"host":"ldaps://LDAPURL","port":636,"use_ssl":true,"username_password":{"password":"CLEARTEXTPASSWORD","username":"AD\\USER"}},"created_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T11:53:47Z","deleted_at":null,"deleted_by_id":null}

```
# Scope – pre-requisite

To get the above mentioned list of connections you need to have a to be an **authenticated admin**, so it is not open to everyone.

# Scope – affected plugins

As not every password was visible, several plugins have been tested (not every plugin!) and thus two Plugins seem to be affected:

**LDAP plugin** and **OTRS plugin**

# Impact

To score the vulnerability, the best way to go for is leverage CVSS, and the rating for this vulnerability is a [CVSS Score:3.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C/CR:M/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:L/MI:N/MA:N)

```
CVSS Base Score:3.4
Impact Subscore:1.4
Exploitability Subscore:1.7
CVSS Temporal Score:3.1
CVSS Environmental Score:3.1
Modified Impact Subscore:1.4
Overall CVSS Score:3.1

Via Slack, Komand engineers are asking for my feedback if the patch is indeed fixing the issue I reported, after updating I was able to confirm that.

## November 2,2018 pro assigned CVE

Rapid7 reached out to me and CIRCL (who seems to have reported the issue in parallel but I had no SYN ACK from them but told them that they did not need to further disclose as soon as I discovered the Rapid 7 portal.

In this mail I was told the pre assigned CVE for the issue and the CVSS rating their engineering team came up with. They also asked if I plan to write a blog post or other coverage (which you can read at the moment).

# Affected?

All versions below 0.42.0 is affected. Afaik it is only the OTRS and the LDAP plugin.

# Mitigation

Patch to Komand version 0.42.0 or later. I would recommend to reset the password to all accounts stored for LDAP and OTRS plugins.

# Exploited?

Most people might ask – alright, so how can i find out if someone with bad intention has used this vulnerability. The only way to tell is to check the web logs of Komand and look for GET requests to /v2/connections from unusual source IPs.

# Feedback

The way this issue was handled was straight forward, at any point I had the impression that my issue was treated on the right level, no over hyping and no „we don’t care“ just the right balance.

It is notably that the online form used by Rapid7 is supporting this process a lot, I assume it makes it easy to scope issues on engineering site as well as easy for the researcher who wants to know what the current status of the reported issue is.

It is also good to see that the work from the [FIRST CVSS sig](https://first.org/cvss/) is adding value in such issues as it helps both sides to rate the vulnerability.
