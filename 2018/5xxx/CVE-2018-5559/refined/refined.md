  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-5559",
    "description": "The vulnerability is an information disclosure in Komand Security Orchestrator (v0.40.2) where certain API endpoints could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response.",
    "root_cause": "The API endpoint `/v2/connections` for the Komand Security Orchestrator was not properly sanitizing the output for certain plugins, leading to the disclosure of stored credentials in cleartext.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
       "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"
    ],
    "impact": "The exposure of cleartext credentials stored in Komand, allows an attacker with admin access to potentially gain access to other systems by using the disclosed credentials.",
    "attack_vector": "An authenticated admin user would need to send a GET request to the `/v2/connections` API endpoint.",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated admin access to the Komand Security Orchestrator"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was found during reverse engineering of the API, specifically when looking at the /connections API endpoint. Only the LDAP and OTRS plugins were affected by the information disclosure. The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to Rapid7 and was patched in version 0.42.0."
