Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-5410:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `dokan1.sys` driver of the Dokan Open Source File System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `dokan1.sys` driver does not properly validate user-provided input, leading to the stack-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability exists in versions of Dokan between 1.0.0.5000 and 1.2.0.1000, and was introduced in version 1.0.0.5000.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can corrupt kernel memory.
- This can lead to elevation of privileges and ultimately gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can create a device handle to the vulnerable system driver.
- The attacker can then send arbitrary input to the driver, which triggers the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a device handle to the system driver.
- The attacker must be able to send specially crafted input to the device handle.
- The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `dokan1.sys` driver.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow.
- The issue was fixed in Dokan version 1.2.1.1000 by validating user input.
- The vulnerability was reported by Parvez Anwar.
- Several vendors were affected, including Atmo O, FtpUse, Google, Keybase, MLV Filesystem, MSSQLFS, MooseFS, Ninefs, OpenDedup, RedFS, SrcDemo2, WinUnionFS, encfs4win, and fuse-nfs.
- Keybase addressed the issue by upgrading to Dokan 1.2.1.2000 and adding a check to prevent mounting with older drivers.
- Exploit code is available publicly.
