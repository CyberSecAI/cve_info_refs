{
  "CVE-2018-5873": {
    "Description": "The provided information indicates a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's nsfs filesystem, specifically within the `__ns_get_path()` function. This vulnerability is triggered when the stashed dentry is freed concurrently with its usage.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper RCU (Read-Copy-Update) API usage on the free path of a dentry. While the code uses `rcu_read_lock()` to protect access to the `dentry`, the `__d_free()` function, which could free the `dentry`, isn't called in a way that honors the RCU read lock, leading to a potential use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to various impacts, including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. The exact impact can depend on how the freed memory is utilized after it is freed.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by operations that involve accessing namespace file system entries. The commit message describes a call stack showing `open_related_ns()` and `sock_ioctl()` involved in triggering the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would likely need to trigger specific ioctl operations that cause the namespace file system to access the stashed `dentry` while it is being freed concurrently. The attacker needs to be able to perform operations that involve accessing namespace file system entries."
