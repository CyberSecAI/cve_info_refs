- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding of the `module` parameter in the `index.php` file when accessed via a GET request. Specifically, when an invalid module is requested, the application reflects the unsanitized input in an error message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `module` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the error message which is reflected back to the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
    - Non-persistent phishing attacks: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Non-persistent external redirects to malicious sources.
    - Non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted GET request to the `index.php` file. The attacker must include malicious JavaScript code in the `module` parameter. The attack is considered remote.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a URL to a user of the CentOS Web Panel. The attacker does not need any prior access or user account with the application. The victim user needs to click the malicious link to trigger the vulnerability.
