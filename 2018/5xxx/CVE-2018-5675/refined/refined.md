  "CVE-2018-5675": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of embedded U3D images inside of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of embedded U3D images inside of PDF files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious PDF file"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create and deliver a malicious PDF containing a specially crafted U3D object to a user."
