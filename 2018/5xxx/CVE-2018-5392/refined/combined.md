## mingw-w64 by default produces executables that opt in to ASLR, but are not compatible with ASLR

#### Vulnerability Note VU#307144

Original Release Date: 2018-08-03 | Last Revised: 2018-08-03

---

### Overview

mingw-w64 produces a executable Windows files without a relocations table by default, which breaks compatibility with ASLR.

### Description

| ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the "Dynamic base" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workaround: |
| --- |

| **Force mingw-w64 to retain the relocations table**  mingw-w64 can be coerced into producing an executable with the relocations table intact by adding the following line before the main function in a program's source code:\_\_declspec(dllexport)This line will cause the following function to be exported. When generating an executable that exports a function name, mingw-w64 will not strip the relocations table. |
