The provided content is related to CVE-2018-5392.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The mingw-w64 compiler, by default, strips the relocations table from generated Windows executables, which breaks compatibility with Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of a relocations table in executables generated by mingw-w64 despite having the "Dynamic base" PE header that indicates ASLR compatibility.
- This makes the executables vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks, as ASLR cannot properly randomize memory addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 are more easily exploitable due to the failure of ASLR. Vulnerabilities in such executables become more susceptible to ROP attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Windows executables compiled with mingw-w64 using ROP techniques due to the absence of a relocations table, and thus the ineffectiveness of ASLR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to exploit vulnerabilities in programs compiled with mingw-w64 on Windows platforms.
- The attacker needs knowledge of ROP techniques.
