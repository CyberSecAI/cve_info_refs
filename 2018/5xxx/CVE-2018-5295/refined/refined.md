Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5295

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `PdfXRefStreamParserObject::ParseStream` function within the PoDoFo library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A signed integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of an array. Specifically, a large value is added to an existing value which exceeds the capacity of the signed integer data type, causing the overflow. This occurs at `src/base/PdfXRefStreamParserObject.cpp:125:64`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) via a crafted PDF file. The integer overflow leads to a crash due to the out-of-bounds write or memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted PDF file is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PDF to the vulnerable application (PoDoFo) for processing, for example via the `podofoimgextract` tool.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in PoDoFo version `RELEASE_0.9.5_rc1`.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) file is available to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the PoDoFo developers via mailing list.
- The specific line where the overflow occurs: `src/src/base/PdfXRefStreamParserObject.cpp:125:64`
- The vulnerability was identified using UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer).
