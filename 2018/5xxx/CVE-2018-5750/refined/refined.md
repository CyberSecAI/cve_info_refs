{
  "CVE-2018-5750": {
    "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel pointer addresses).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The acpi_smbus_hc_add() function in drivers/acpi/sbshc.c prints a kernel address in the kernel log during boot due to a missing sanitization of the printk message.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can obtain kernel pointer addresses by reading dmesg, potentially bypassing Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to read the dmesg logs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs local access to the system to view the kernel logs."
