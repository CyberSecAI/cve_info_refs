- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Easy Custom Auto Excerpt" allows users, even those with low privileges like "editor" roles, to inject malicious code into the plugin's settings, specifically within the `custom_css` option. The injected code is not sanitized, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users (including administrators) when they view the page where the vulnerable settings are rendered. This can lead to session hijacking (stealing cookies) or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have at least editor-level access to the WordPress admin panel and use the "Easy Custom Auto Excerpt" plugin's settings page to inject the malicious code into the `custom_css` option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low privilege role (e.g., editor) in the affected WordPress instance and the "Easy Custom Auto Excerpt" plugin must be enabled and its custom CSS feature accessible to the user.
