Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2018-5168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability of websites to bypass security checks related to installing lightweight themes. This occurs because the checks rely on the `baseURI` property of the theme element, which can be manipulated by a malicious site (e.g., by using a `<base href="...">` tag) to impersonate a trusted origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Validation:** The add-on manager incorrectly relies on the `baseURI` property of a theme element for security checks, which is a property easily controlled by malicious websites.
- **Lack of Origin Verification:**  The system does not properly verify the origin of the theme installation request, allowing any website to appear as a trusted source.
- **Bypassable Permissions:**  Lightweight themes can be installed without user interaction by manipulating the `baseURI` property, bypassing normal permission prompts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Theme Installation:** A malicious website can install a theme without user consent.
- **Arbitrary Theme Content:** The installed themes can contain offensive, embarrassing, or otherwise unwanted content, including modified UI elements, potentially confusing users.
- **Tracking Potential:**  Themes could be used for tracking via update URLs as mentioned in [bug 527463](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=527463).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The attack is carried out by enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage which manipulates the `baseURI` property when installing lightweight themes.
- **Social Engineering:** The user is typically unaware of the theme being installed, it happens silently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page accessible to the victim.
- **No Elevated Privileges:** The attacker does not require any elevated privileges or special access to the user's system, only user interaction.
- **User Interaction:** Minimal user action is required, simply visiting the web page is enough to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the way lightweight themes are installed.
*   The fix involves checking the origin of the install request more thoroughly.
*   The fix requires changes to the code in  `browser/base/content/browser-addons.js`
*   The patch is described as small, non-risky.
*   The fix has been applied to Firefox 60 and ESR 52.8.
*   A public Proof of Concept (PoC) is available to demonstrate this issue.
