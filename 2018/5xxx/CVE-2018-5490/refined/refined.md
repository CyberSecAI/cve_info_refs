Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-5490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper enforcement of read-only export policy rules in Clustered Data ONTAP 8.3 Release Candidate versions for SMBv2 and SMBv3 clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly enforce read-only restrictions for SMBv2 and SMBv3 clients.
- This results in authenticated clients gaining write access to data intended to be read-only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain write access to CIFS data that should have been restricted to read-only.
- This could lead to the deletion or manipulation of data that is supposed to be protected as read-only.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the SMBv2 and SMBv3 protocols.
- It affects authenticated users that are supposed to have only read access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SMB service.
- They also need to be connected using SMBv2 or SMBv3 protocols.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in the release candidate (RC) versions of Clustered Data ONTAP 8.3 and was resolved in the GA release.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.5 (MEDIUM), with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:H/RL:U/RC:C.
