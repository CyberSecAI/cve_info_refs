The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Add-Link-to-Facebook" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin does not properly sanitize user input in the `al2fb_facebook_id` parameter when updating a user's profile. This lack of input sanitization allows the user to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users who view the affected profile page (e.g., an administrator).
- This could lead to session hijacking (cookie theft), arbitrary actions being performed on behalf of the administrator, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `al2fb_facebook_id` parameter when updating their user profile on the `/wordpress/wp-admin/profile.php` page.
- The malicious script is stored in the database.
- When another user (e.g., administrator) views the user's profile at `/wordpress/wp-admin/user-edit.php`, the stored JavaScript code executes within their browser session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a user account with the ability to edit their profile on the WordPress site, specifically an account that can use the plugin. The example specifies a "low privilege role" like an editor.
- The attacker needs access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- No special administrator privileges are required by the attacker initially, but successful exploitation could give the attacker administrator privileges.
