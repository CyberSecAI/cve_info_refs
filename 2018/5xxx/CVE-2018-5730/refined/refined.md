{
  "CVE-2018-5730": {
    "description": "MIT krb5 1.6 or later allows an authenticated kadmin with permission to add principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to circumvent a DN containership check by supplying both a \"linkdn\" and \"containerdn\" database argument, or by supplying a DN string which is a left extension of a container DN string but is not hierarchically within the container DN.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of Distinguished Names (DNs) when adding principals to an LDAP Kerberos database. Specifically, the kadmin interface doesn't properly check if a provided DN, a 'linkdn', and/or a 'containerdn' argument are within the allowed subtree in the LDAP database.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient input validation",
           "Improper access control"
        ],
        "impact": "An authenticated kadmin user with the ability to add principals can circumvent the intended DN containership checks. This could allow for the creation of Kerberos principals outside of their designated locations in the LDAP hierarchy, potentially violating security policies and creating a vector for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "kadmin command line interface",
             "LDAP database"

        "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to authenticate to a kadmin instance and have privileges to add Kerberos principals to an LDAP database."
