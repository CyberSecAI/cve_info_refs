Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-5738:

**1. Vulnerability Identification:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5738
*   **Description:** The vulnerability exists in ISC BIND, a widely used DNS server software. Specifically, versions 9.9.12, 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3, 9.11.3-S1, 9.11.3-S2 9.12.0 through 9.12.1-P2, and 9.13.0 are vulnerable.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how BIND handles the "allow-recursion" setting. When this setting isn't explicitly specified, BIND may incorrectly enable recursion for all clients. This deviates from the expected behavior, which would restrict recursion to authorized clients only.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Recursion Handling:** BIND fails to properly restrict recursive queries when the "allow-recursion" setting is not explicitly configured, allowing unauthorized clients to perform recursive queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information via the DNS server.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, possibly because of excessive or unauthorized recursive queries.
* **DNS Reflection Attacks**: The vulnerability could be used in DNS reflection attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors and Required Capabilities:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based.
*   **Attacker Position:** Remote attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special attacker capabilities are needed. An attacker could be any unauthorized client that is able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable BIND server.
*   **Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to be low complexity.

**6. Affected Products (NetApp Context):**

*   **Affected:** Data ONTAP Edge is listed as an affected product.

*   **Not Affected:** Many NetApp products, such as Clustered Data ONTAP, ONTAP 7-mode, E-series, StorageGRID, and OnCommand products, are explicitly listed as *not affected*.

**7. Remediation:**

*   **NetApp:**  NetApp's advisory states that Data ONTAP Edge has no plan to address this vulnerability and recommends reviewing the End of Availability announcement. No workarounds are provided in the advisory.
*   **Ubuntu:** Upgrade the `bind9` package to version `1:9.11.3+dfsg-1ubuntu1.1` or later on Ubuntu 18.04.
*   **Gentoo:** Upgrade `net-dns/bind` to version `9.12.1_p2-r1` or later.

**8. Severity:**

*   **NetApp:** CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).
*   **Gentoo:** "normal" severity.

**Additional Observations:**

*   The provided NetApp advisory (NTAP-20190830-0002) is specific to CVE-2018-5738 and includes the CVSS score and affected/unaffected NetApp products. It also indicates public awareness of the vulnerability.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3683-1) references the CVE and provides remediation guidance for Ubuntu systems.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201903-13) lists CVE-2018-5738 and two other related CVEs (CVE-2018-5740, CVE-2018-5741). It also recommends upgrading the affected package version.
*   The vulnerability is related to an incorrect configuration or handling of the recursion feature in BIND rather than a flaw in the core code itself.

In summary, CVE-2018-5738 describes a vulnerability in ISC BIND that can lead to information disclosure and potentially DoS/DNS reflection attacks due to improper handling of the `allow-recursion` configuration. Patches are available through package upgrades for affected Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Gentoo. NetApp has indicated that Data ONTAP Edge is affected but not patching and provided a EOA announcement.
