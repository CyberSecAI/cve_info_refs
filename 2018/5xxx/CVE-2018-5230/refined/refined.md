Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the issue collector component of Atlassian Jira. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way Jira handles error messages for custom fields when an invalid value is submitted through the issue collector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS (RXSS). This means that the malicious script is injected into the error message and then reflected back to the user.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The Jira application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before embedding it into error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary HTML and JavaScript Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into a Jira page via the error messages.
- **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to the attacker executing malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser session, potentially allowing them to perform actions on the user's behalf, such as stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
- **Malicious Redirects/Content Injection:** The attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious websites or inject malicious content onto Jira pages, impacting user experience and trust.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Issue Collector:** The vulnerability is triggered via the issue collector, which is a feature used to create new issues in Jira.
- **Invalid Custom Field Values:** The attack is initiated by submitting a malformed input value for a custom field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
- **Basic knowledge of Jira:** The attacker needs to be aware of the presence of an issue collector and be able to interact with the issue creation interface.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious input containing HTML or JavaScript code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as a medium severity issue.
- Fixed versions are provided for different Jira versions (7.10.0, 7.9.2, 7.7.4, 7.8.4, 7.6.7).
- The vulnerability affects Jira versions from 7.08 to 7.9.1 and versions prior to 7.6.7.
- The issue was introduced in version 7.08.
