Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2018-5733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a reference count overflow in `dhcpd`, the DHCP server daemon, when processing client requests. Specifically, the server does not handle reference counting correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reference Count Overflow:** A 32-bit reference counter can overflow when processing a large number of DHCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the `dhcpd` process, making the server unavailable to provide DHCP services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious DHCP Client:** A malicious DHCP client sends a large volume of packets to a vulnerable DHCP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the network and able to send a large amount of DHCP traffic to the target server.  The attacker is not required to be authenticated but does need to have network access to send packets to the server.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
*   A malicious client is described as being able to send "billions of packets" to a DHCP server to trigger the overflow.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple DHCP versions: 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, and 4.4.0
*   The vulnerability is triggered on the server side by the crafted client traffic.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a reference count overflow which leads to the crash.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Felix Wilhelm of Google.
*   Upstream fix: <https://source.isc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=dhcp.git;a=commitdiff;h=197b26f25309f947b97a83b8fdfc414b767798f8>
*   Upstream bug (not public): <https://bugs.isc.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=47140>
*   Red Hat has issued errata to address this vulnerability: RHSA-2018:0469, and RHSA-2018:0483
*   Ubuntu has also issued a security notice USN-3586-1 and USN-3586-2 to fix this issue.
*   Debian issued a security advisory DSA-4133-1 and DLA 1313-1 to address this.
*   The fix involves backporting the relevant changes to existing versions, rather than upgrading to a new upstream version.
