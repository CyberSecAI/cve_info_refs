  "CVE-2018-5175": {
    "description": "A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a `script-src` policy of `'strict-dynamic'`. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the `require.js` library that is part of Firefoxâ€™s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to load `require.js` from Firefox's Developer Tools using a `resource://` URI, which bypasses the Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. By loading `require.js` an attacker could then use known techniques in this library to bypass CSP restrictions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "CSP bypass",
       "HTML injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass CSP restrictions on a website, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the target domain via an HTML injection vulnerability on the website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTML injection",
      "Loading of `resource://` URIs"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to inject HTML into a target website. They do not need access to the underlying server or infrastructure, but they need a vector to execute injected HTML/script.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability leverages the `require.js` library within Firefox's Developer Tools, using its capability to load and execute scripts from a `data:` URI via its `data-main` attribute. This can bypass the `strict-dynamic` CSP, which is meant to prevent the execution of inline scripts and eval()"
