```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input validation in the SonicOS web interface, allowing injection of malicious script code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Filter bypass: The application fails to properly filter or encode user-supplied input when adding or editing custom categories or cloud AV exclusions.",
    "Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS): Malicious script code injected through the vulnerable input fields is stored and executed when the affected pages are accessed.",
     "Insufficient input validation: The application doesn't properly sanitize user input in the 'Name', 'Content', and 'Cloud AV Signature ID' fields."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers with privileged or low-privileged web application user accounts can exploit the vulnerability via the web interface. The attack involves sending POST requests to specific pages of the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a valid user account with either low-privileged or privileged access to the SonicOS web interface. No other specific positioning is mentioned."
