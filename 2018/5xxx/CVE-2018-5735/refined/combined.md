## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bind9](/tracker/source-package/bind9) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bind9)) | bullseye | 1:9.16.50-1~deb11u2 | fixed |
|  | bullseye (security) | 1:9.16.50-1~deb11u1 | fixed |
|  | bookworm, bookworm (security) | 1:9.18.28-1~deb12u2 | fixed |
|  | trixie | 1:9.20.4-3 | fixed |
|  | sid | 1:9.20.4-4 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bind9](/tracker/source-package/bind9) | source | wheezy | 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u20 |  | [DLA-1285-1](/tracker/DLA-1285-1) |  |
| [bind9](/tracker/source-package/bind9) | source | (unstable) | 1:9.9.3.dfsg.P2-1 |  |  | [889285](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=889285) |

## Notes

```
Issue similar/closely related to the CVE-2017-3139 issue in Red Hat.
Mark as fixed version the 1:9.9.3.dfsg.P2-1 as the related code was
added upstream in 9.9.3b1. The issue though does not affect bind9 upstream
and is only triggered as described in #889285.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
