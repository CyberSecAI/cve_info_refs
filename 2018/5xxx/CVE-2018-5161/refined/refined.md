  "cveId": "CVE-2018-5161",
  "description": "Crafted message headers can cause a Thunderbird process to hang on receiving the message.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A crafted email message with malformed headers can trigger a hang state in Thunderbird due to an inefficient header processing algorithm.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the way Thunderbird processes certain malformed email headers, specifically those with an excessive number of '@' characters, causing a denial-of-service condition."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS), where Thunderbird process hangs, consuming 100% of the CPU resources and increasing memory usage, potentially making the application unusable until the problematic email is removed via a web interface or by directly editing mailbox files. The hang can persist across restarts of the application in some cases.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector is through email messages. An attacker sends a crafted email to a victim's Thunderbird client.",
      "The attacker can cause a DoS on the victim's Thunderbird client."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim's Thunderbird email client.",
     "The attacker needs to construct an email with malformed headers containing specific combinations of characters."
    ]
  }
