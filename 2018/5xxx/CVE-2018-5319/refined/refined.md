{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-5319",
    "description": "The RAVPower device with firmware version 2.000.056 is vulnerable to a memory disclosure. By sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the device, an attacker can cause the device to disclose portions of its memory in the HTTP response.",
    "root_cause": "The device fails to properly handle long input strings in the 'opt' parameter of the 'protocol.csp' endpoint, resulting in a stack-based memory disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Memory disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the device's memory, which could include configuration settings, passwords, or other confidential data. The disclosed memory can help the attacker to understand more the internal behavior of the device and possibly launch further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the device over the network, typically via port 80. The request targets the 'protocol.csp' endpoint with a long string in the 'opt' parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to it. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. "
