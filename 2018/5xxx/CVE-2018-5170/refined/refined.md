  "CVE-2018-5170": {
    "description": "It was discovered that the filename of an attachment could be spoofed. An attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking the user in to opening an attachment of a different type to the one expected.",
    "root_cause": "The GUI displays the filename outlined in the “Content-Type” header, which is not related to the real resource specified via the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Filename spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious attachment by displaying a misleading filename",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted email with an external attachment."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send a specially crafted email."
    ],
      "details": "The vulnerability arises from how Thunderbird handles external attachments specified with the X-Mozilla-External-Attachment-URL header. The GUI displays the filename from the Content-Type header instead of the actual resource. This allows an attacker to present a benign filename (e.g., image.jpg), while the actual attachment is a different, potentially harmful file (e.g., malicious.exe)."
