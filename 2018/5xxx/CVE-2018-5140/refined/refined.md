Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that `moz-icon:` URLs could be crafted to include a nested URL (e.g., `moz-icon:<http://localhost/poc.html?size=64&contentType=application/xml>`). This allowed web content to access and read images associated with these `moz-icon` URLs, which should not be accessible from the web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information leakage. By accessing `moz-icon` images, a malicious website could determine which applications are associated with specific MIME types on the user's system.
*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The nested URL within the `moz-icon:` URL was treated as same-origin, allowing the execution of JavaScript within the context of the `moz-icon` URL. This could lead to further attacks if not for the fix.
*   **Missing Restriction on moz-icon URIs:** The code did not properly restrict `moz-icon` URIs to only use nested `file:` URIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could potentially profile users by determining which applications are associated with certain file types. This could aid in targeted attacks or fingerprinting users across browsing sessions.
*   **Possible Same-Origin Bypass:** This allows an attacker to load and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the nested URL within the `moz-icon:` URL.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The issue was found to have unexpected behavior and could potentially crash when trying to create blob URLs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** A specially crafted website could use script to access and read images from crafted `moz-icon:` URLs.
*   **Social Engineering:** Users could be tricked into visiting malicious websites that exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into an existing site.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious page in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the Bugzilla Entry:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Abdulrahman Alqabandi (qab) and was assigned to Gijs.
* The issue was initially reported on Firefox Nightly 59.0a1.
* The vulnerability was fixed by restricting the inner URIs of `moz-icon` to be `file:` URIs.
*  The fix was included in Firefox 59.
*  The security impact was classified as "sec-low".
* Patches were reviewed and approved by Boris Zbarsky and Valentin Gosu.
