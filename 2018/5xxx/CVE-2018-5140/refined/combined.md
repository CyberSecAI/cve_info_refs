## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Tested on Nightly 59.0a1 (2017-12-07) (64-bit).
View attached PoC.
Actual results:
It seems that we can still link moz-icon urls if we include the current pages URL within it like so: moz-icon:<http://localhost/poc.html?size=64&contentType=application/xml>
I then noticed that we can read the image through canvas.toDataURL. So we are now able to determine which application is used to open certain file types, as well as potential fingerprinting of user within private browsing (?).
Expected results:
moz-icon should be blocked from linking on the web. Also I think its worth checking why canvas.toDataURL is working here.

Doesn't work on macOS with e10s because of sandboxing (see [bug 1419811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [macOS][e10s] File listings no longer show icons for non-folders")).
Prior to [bug 1222924](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222924 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop exposing the moz-icon URL scheme to the web"), you could just do this the easy way by using moz-icon://.xml?size=16 , so it seems this being broken on 58 beta is kind of expected - but I think being able to read it doesn't work on 57/58 with just moz-icon://.xml?size=16 .
Either way, it's unexpected that it's still possible to do this on nightly. On the other hand, I'm a bit confused/worried that it seems in/after [bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files."), we didn't restrict moz-icon to only be have nested file: URIs.

I haven't managed to reproduce on Linux so far... Also sandboxing?

It seems like the URL is treated completely same origin, we can even frame it and execute js in it.
<iframe src="moz-icon:<http://localhost/evil.ani>" onload="window[0].eval('alert(location)')"></iframe>
Perhaps there is something checking to see if a given url contains {uri-scheme}:<http://{same-origin-domain>}.. and automatically gives it same-origin status?

There are at least 4 ways of fixing this:
- <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/281d99b3d342b71d0653b872345761372d38f5c1/caps/nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp#843-845>
should be checking aTargetURI instead of aTargetBaseURI .
- <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a461fe03fdb07218b7f50e92c59dde64b8f8a5b0/image/decoders/icon/nsIconURI.cpp#208>
and any other entrypoints into moz-icon URI constructors should only allow 'file' inner URIs.
- the contentType query parameter shouldn't do anything when there's a nested URI (not 100% sure if this is a red herring - I'd expect "foo.com/bar.<extension>" might also get you an icon for that extension, without the contentType param)
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1171853#c6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853#c6 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript")
I'll see what I can do about getting patches for these. At least the moz-icon inner http URI one should be easy to fix. I don't know how much fallout there would be from fixing the first issue. From what I can tell quickly, moz-icon is the only UI\_RESOURCE URI type that is ever nested, so it should be fine, but perhaps I'm missing something. Like, perhaps that'll break file: directory listing icons again (sigh...).
[bug 1171853](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript") is going to be more work to address, and isn't generally an issue because if you've got a nested URI that points to foo.com, it's mostly sensible that it's same-origin with "actual" foo.com . But for that to be the case, the data that a channel to that URI provides would actually want to come from foo.com, which clearly isn't the case here.
It would help if there was a sec rating on this bug so I had an idea about how cautious I need to be about pushing to try. While I'm annoyed that I missed this, I don't know how severe "know what applications the user has installed" is, in the general case. Sec-moderate, from a quick look at the severity ratings page?Assignee: nobody â†’ gijskruitbosch+bugsStatus: UNCONFIRMED â†’ ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: true

Attached file
[dump-icon.txt](attachment.cgi?id=8936419)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8936419&action=edit)

I tried to create a blob URL within the moz-icon URL and apparently I got a possible stack corruption tab crash:
Possible Stack Corruption starting at xul!mozilla\_dump\_image+0x0000000000928669 (Hash=0xa1943e15.0xf278a43e)
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/b8b3001b-e0b2-42ec-957d-463540171212>
Also I attached the dump log where possible stack corruption was seen (using 'exploitable' module)
To repro:
<iframe src="moz-icon:<http://localhost/evil.ani>" onload="window[0].eval(`URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([''],{type:'text/html'}))`)"></iframe>
Doesn't work within view-source: page so it seems unique to moz-icon. This may be a sign that this context will result in unexpected behavior. Will test more.

New crash report using similar poc as above (except I loaded a moz-icon uri with a lot of junk in it)
Notice some of the frames are hex with no name, isn't that bad?:
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/87bf5f3a-51f0-41fc-a831-4364b0171212>
Should I open a new bug for that? or deal with it all here?

File a new bug. Looks like issues with blob serialization/deserialization.

We should probably add a test to test\_moz\_icon\_uri.js in a follow up patch.

[bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files.") was sec-low, and this doesn't even confirm the existence of actual local files, just whether specific mime types are set to be handled by specific programs, which seems less serious (given that up until pretty recently, you could just ask the 'plugins' object whether the adobe acrobat npapi plugin was installed, for instance). So going to mark as sec-low and land the patches. Ni'ing Dan so he can change severity if necessary.
I'll try to address point 4 from [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - moz-icon images can be linked and read from the web") in [bug 1171853](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript") either before or after the Christmas / New Year's break, depending on the rest of my queue. I don't currently have any reason to believe it's urgent given the other restrictions that are in place.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-disclosure](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-disclosure&resolution=---),

It's true that they didn't provide a working PoC, but even detecting arbitrary local files is only sec-moderate, and as I already said, this bug seems less severe (it doesn't detect arbitrary local files - it detects application handlers that are (or were!) installed, and not even their paths).
Either way, whether it's sec-low or sec-moderate, this can land without sec-approval, which is the salient point for me landing it right now... Seems pretty clear this isn't sec-high/crit.

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
FranÃ§ois Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.
