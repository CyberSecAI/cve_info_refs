Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-5905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Diag driver of Qualcomm components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to an elevation of privilege, potentially allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access or control within the system.

**Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, however, the vulnerability is located within the Diag driver which typically interacts directly with the hardware and low-level system functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the Diag driver in a way that triggers the vulnerability. The specific capabilities are not detailed, but given that it's an EoP vulnerability within a driver, it likely would require some existing level of access or the ability to influence system operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is marked as "moderate" in severity.
- The fix for this vulnerability is referenced by QC-CR#2169715 and the associated commit [6eb2f4f6fde1b210712d6ac66b40b9e7684d77db](https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/kernel/msm-4.4/commit/?id=6eb2f4f6fde1b210712d6ac66b40b9e7684d77db)
