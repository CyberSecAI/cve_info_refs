Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The "Media from FTP" WordPress plugin is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to insufficient input sanitization of the `searchdir` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The plugin allows user-supplied input to control the directory being searched.
    *   It does not properly validate or sanitize the `searchdir` parameter.
    *   It allows directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the search path.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can view arbitrary files and directories on the server.
    *   The attacker can potentially access sensitive information, including configuration files, database credentials, and other confidential data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP POST request to the `admin.php?page=mediafromftp-search-register` page, which is part of the plugin's functionality.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `searchdir` parameter in the POST request to include directory traversal sequences.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs a low-privileged WordPress user account, such as an editor role, as this plugin function is not restricted to administrator roles.
    *   The plugin "Media from FTP" needs to be enabled by an administrator.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable page.
    *   The target needs to be running a vulnerable version of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content contains images that show the vulnerable search form and the result of a successful directory traversal attack.
*   The WordPress plugin page indicates that the plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download. This suggests that the vulnerability is no longer exploitable in the current version of the plugin or that the plugin itself was removed from the repository.
*   The github report states the plugin allows viewing files outside of the web root
