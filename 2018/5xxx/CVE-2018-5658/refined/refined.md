The provided content describes stored XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in the "responsive-coming-soon-page" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation in the plugin's settings page. Specifically, multiple parameters are vulnerable to XSS due to lack of proper filtering.
- Absence of CSRF protection on the settings update form, allowing malicious actions via forged requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Stored XSS:** Several parameters in the plugin's settings page are vulnerable to stored XSS. The injected JavaScript payload is stored in the database and executed when the admin revisits the settings page or when the coming-soon page is displayed. The vulnerable parameters include:
    - `coming-soon_title`
    - `coming-soon_sub_title`
    - `logo_width`
    - `logo_height`
    - `bg_color`
    - `button_text_link`
    - `social_icon_1`
    - `counter_title_icon`
    - `counter_title`

2.  **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The settings update form lacks CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, will submit a forged request to update the plugin settings and inject XSS payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Account takeover
    - Data theft
    - Malicious redirection
    - Defacement of the website
    - Further attacks against other users.
- **CSRF:** An attacker can trick an authenticated admin user into performing unwanted actions, such as:
    - Injecting XSS payloads via plugin settings.
    - Modifying other plugin settings.
    - Potentially escalating privileges if other vulnerable options are available.
    - Perform any actions the admin could perform.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:** Exploited through the plugin's settings page, accessible to administrators.
- **CSRF:** Exploited by tricking a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page containing a crafted form that submits a request to the vulnerable plugin settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Stored XSS:**
    - The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters by examining the plugin's settings page.
    - The attacker needs the ability to modify the plugin settings (typically requires administrator or equivalent access).
- **CSRF:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to host malicious HTML content.
    - The attacker needs to trick an administrator into visiting the malicious HTML page.

**Additional notes**
- The attacker can combine CSRF and Stored XSS to gain persistent access and potentially achieve full site compromise.
- The described vulnerabilities were tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the responsive-coming-soon-page plugin.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject a stored XSS payload using CSRF.
