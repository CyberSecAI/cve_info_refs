- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the login functionality of Zechat 1.5.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization or validation when handling user-supplied data in the login process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `login.php` page, specifically through the user input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the `login.php` page. The attacker does not need any special privileges other than the ability to access the vulnerable web application. The provided Proof of Concept shows how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability with a specially crafted username.
