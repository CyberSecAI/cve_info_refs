{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-5332",
  "description": "Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The RDS protocol does not properly validate RDMA requests when allocating pages for DMA operations, specifically when args->nr_local is 0 in rds_rdma_extra_size(), which is used in rds_message_alloc_sgs().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient validation of RDMA requests.",
      "Improper calculation of the number of pages, leading to heap corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially achieve privilege escalation by triggering an out-of-bounds write.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to a system with the RDS module loaded.",
       "Specifically crafted RDMA requests with a value that bypasses validation."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system with the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) module loaded and the ability to send a crafted RDMA request. Root or CAP_NET_ADMIN is not strictly needed, but may help in module loading and other preparations for the exploit."
