Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple application-side POST inject web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official CentOS Web Panel v0.9.8.12.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the vulnerable modules.
The vulnerabilities are located in the `id` and `email\_address` values of the `index.php` file POST method request. Remote attackers
are able to inject script code to the POST method request to manipulate the item listing output context. The request method to inject
is POST and the attack vector is persistent on the application-side. The injection point are the add POST method requests and the
execution point occurs in the output side with the added context.
The security risk of the persistent vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] phpini\_editor
[+] mail\_add-new
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] index.php
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] id
[+] email\_address
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The application-side post inject web vulnerabilities can be exploited by local low privileged user account with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

| Reference(s): http://localhost:2030/index.php?module=mail\_add-new Solution - Fix & Patch: ======================= The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable `id` and `email address` parameters of the index.php file POST method request. Disallow usage of special chars and restrict the parameter input to prevent application-side script code injection attacks. Filter in the output error or the item listing the vulnerable location were the code executes. Security Risk: ============== The security risk of the application-side input validation vulnerabilities in the web-application are estimated as medium.
