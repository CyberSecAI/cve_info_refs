- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation of `id` and `email_address` parameters in POST requests to `index.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Attackers can inject malicious script code into vulnerable parameters via POST requests. The injected code is then stored and executed when the data is displayed in the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can inject malicious scripts through POST requests to the `index.php` file in the `phpini_editor` and `mail_add-new` modules. The injected code is stored and executed when the associated content is rendered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a low-privileged web application user account and low user interaction.
