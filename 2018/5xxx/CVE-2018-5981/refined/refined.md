Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by SQL injection in the `com_gallery_wd` component of Joomla!

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform various malicious actions, including:
    - Database information disclosure (extracting usernames, passwords, database schemas, etc.)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Potential for further compromise of the webserver or underlying system depending on database user permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors are the `tag_id` and `gallery_id` parameters of the `index.php` endpoint of the vulnerable component:
    - `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_gallery_wd&tag_id=[SQL]&view=GalleryBox&gallery_id=7`
    - `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_gallery_wd&tag_id=&view=GalleryBox&gallery_id=[SQL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance, meaning they can be external or internal attackers with network access.
- No prior authentication is required as these parameters are accessed directly in the URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit code demonstrates how to inject SQL statements using `UPDTAEXML` or `EXTRACTVALUE` functions to obtain database information.
- The vulnerable component is identified as "Gallery WD" version 1.3.6.
- The affected software is a Joomla! extension and is available for download through provided link.

The provided information aligns with and expands upon the basic CVE description by giving precise attack vectors and a code example on how to exploit the vulnerability.
