Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way Firefox handles floating `first-letter` style elements during layout operations, specifically within the `nsFirstLetterFrame::CreateContinuationForFloatingParent` function. When a `first-letter` element is styled with `float: inherit` and manipulated in a specific way, the code uses the wrong parent's style, leading to inconsistent state of the first-letter element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is a **heap-buffer-overflow** in the `nsFirstLetterFrame::CreateContinuationForFloatingParent` function. This occurs because, during layout, when a floating first-letter element is being processed and its parent style information is required, the code incorrectly looks up style properties from the incorrect parent element. This can occur when the style context has changed due to re-parenting operations. Specifically the code was not using the correct parent style for `inherit`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to memory corruption.
*   **Application Crash:** The memory corruption can result in a potentially exploitable crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the provided information doesn't definitively state arbitrary code execution is possible, it is mentioned that the crash is "potentially exploitable", implying that a skilled attacker might be able to leverage the memory corruption to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted HTML/CSS:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted HTML page using CSS properties such as `float: inherit` on `first-letter` elements inside a shadow DOM element, combined with an style that sets column properties.
*  **JavaScript Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered through DOM manipulation and style changes using JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** An attacker would need to be able to serve the specially crafted HTML/CSS to a Firefox user (e.g., via a malicious website).
*   **Understanding of Firefox Layout Engine:** Exploiting the vulnerability likely requires a good understanding of how Firefox's layout engine and style system work.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Nils.
*   The fix involves ensuring the `first-letter` frame inherits the correct parent style when floating, particularly when the frame's style context has changed because of re-parenting operations.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox versions after 55. It is marked as wontfix in Firefox 57, but fixed for firefox 58 and 59.
* The patch was initially checked into the central repository on November 28 and then uplifted to beta shortly after.
