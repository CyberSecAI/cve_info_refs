{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `panel` parameter in multiple PHP files within the WordPress gd-rating-system plugin is vulnerable to both XSS and LFI due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "XSS: Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. LFI: Enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, source code, or other configuration data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `panel` parameter in HTTP GET requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable WordPress installation."
