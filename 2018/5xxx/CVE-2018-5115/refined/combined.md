+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1408138](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408138 "NEW") +++
In [bug 1408183 comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408183#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Backfill sync bookmark validation from sync_summary_v2") through [bug 1408183 comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408183#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - Backfill sync bookmark validation from sync_summary_v2") Jerry describes a related but different problem. Nothing to do with 'Mixed Content', but the fact that background connections (in that example something to do with the OpenH264 plugin handling media server requests) can pop HTTP Auth. They have to go somewhere so we stick them in the currently active page. They don't get the "WARNING this isn't the top-level site" text we give for sub-resource auth because it's disconnected from the page.
Problem compounded in that case because they were http: requests and could be hijacked locally to trigger auth. The real solution would be to ignore HTTP Auth on background requests not associated with a page.

I think toplevelouterwindowid would be 0 in that case (chrome initiated). Note that a toplevel load in a new tab will not have this window id as well - there is no content window for it yet.

no, xhr invoked from a content script will have the correct window (coming from the load context).Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

TriggeringPrincipal == SystemPrincipal is your best bet to figure out if the load is initiated by chrome. Different question, this is only about background loads, doesn't the flag LOAD\_BACKGROUND help to figure out if a channel loads in the background?Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

I am not sure if LOAD\_BACKGROUND is set for that case at all. It is usually set on resources on a page that should not count for onload events, e.g. xhr.
How many false positive we get if we use TriggeringPrincipal == SystemPrincipal? I am ok if we do not block all of them, but I do not want to block something we should not block.Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Are there any legitimate cases for an HTTP Auth ask (401 & 407) by a background connection? I can't recall ever running into this sort of design in any add-ons I've ever used.

From [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections"), this work (setting TriggeringPrincipal to SystemPrincipal for background request) is a work in progress. I just want to know what are the errors if I only check for TriggeringPrincipal == SystemPrincipal.

We fall back to systemPrincipal for triggeringPrincipal when we don't know what really initiated the load. There is a project to fix that that is in progress. Kate - do you have the list of open bugs for this? Dragana - we could show you where in the code we do this, but I don't think we know what situations cause this.Flags: needinfo?(kmckinley)

At the level we're working we probably don't know which loads are initiated by add-ons or not. Background requests with auth are problematic and we'd like to block them. We /tried/ blocking them all, but XHR requests were one that in practice are currently expected to work. If we can distinguish between "background" XHR requests that we can't--for now--break and the true background requests (not associated with any page content) such as the media server connections you found we certainly would want to block the latter.
In the screenshot we are not showing the "WARNING blah blah" text, so we \_know\_ it's not a 3rd party in-page request. In that case can we do a simple check that "if not '3rd party' then it damn well better match the 1st party" when we're about to attach it to a window?

> How many false positive we get if we use TriggeringPrincipal ==

Let me summarize:
(a) for all loads that are \*not\* of TYPE\_DOCUMENT, the triggeringPrincipal is always accurate and reflects the web content that triggered the load, or alternatively, if triggered by the system, then SystemPrincipal.
(b) for loads of TYPE\_DOCUMENT there is some uncertainty about the triggeringPrincipal (we are about to fix that within [Bug 1333030](/show_bug.cgi?id=1333030 "ASSIGNED - [meta] Assert nsDocShell::loadURIWithOptions receives a non null triggeringPrincipal") and dependents):
\* if it's a codebasePrincipal, then we definitely know the load was triggered by web content
\* if it's a systemPrincipal, then we are (my guess) 95% sure the load was triggered by the system
The reason for that uncertainty is that we have a fallback mechanism in place that helps us to generate a triggeringPrincipal if not passed explicitly, see:

>(and of course a completely separate question is why is OpenH264 replying to broadcast messages?)
It's part of the SSDP discovery process: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol> and I assume was implemented as part of the plugin support for H.264 streaming media. As an example, maybe a developer would want to integrate with the Silicon Dust HDHomeRun solution within the browser. In fact I think this might be an actual thing that PLEX supports.

I think this is not accurately diagnose now because we do not have windowId that early in some cases, e.g. opening in a new tab.

Thanks.
I really did not expect that I am going to break our own tests :)
I need to take a look if we do the authentication that we want to forbid or is triggeringPrincipal wrong and set to systemPrincipal.

Yes, there is a stupid test failure that I still do not understand. I will try to fix it in next days. '--verify' mochitest is failing if I only add a empty line, really an empty line, to browser/components/originattributes/test/browser/browser\_httpauth.js - very strange. I need to change the test to make it work with this patch, i.e. i need to change the pref introduce here at the beginning of that test.
I will need to take a close look at IsolationTestTools and probably rewrite it. Sorry for the delay.

The test failure that I have described in [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c32 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections") has just disappeared. It most have been triggered by something completely different. I have spend so much time trying to figure it out.
Anyway, now everything works fine.

This test was added recently. It was not there before. Anyway, since [bug 1423522](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423522 "RESOLVED FIXED - We should not block http-authentication prompts for proxies.") landed we do not need to change this test, so everything is green.

Re: 1425307, 1425386. Luckily there's a solution: either use HTTP for the main site, or switch to using HTTPS for sub-sites and all sub-site resources. Bad practices on the part of a few solutions should never endanger the wider Internet. I've been drafting a short statement on this bug but was waiting for Apple to finish some of their patching before publishing. Maybe it's time to publicly address the flaw which includes suggested guidance? I'm happy to put something together / coordinate with your communications team. I understand this change is likely to cause issues for some, but given the severity to everyone else, I think the steps taken were appropriate.

bug\_1409449\_beta.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: It is not a regression the code exists for a very long time.
[User impact if declined]:This bug disallow a http authentication dialog to be triggered by the non-web content. It can be used for phishing.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: no
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: yes
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: no
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: [bug 1425156](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425156 "VERIFIED FIXED - regression: HTTP Basic Auth dialog won't appear") and also patch bug\_1409449\_tests\_beta.patch from this bug.
[Is the change risky?]: low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: the code change is not risky. triggeringPrincipal is not set always set properly, in most of the cases it is, but I am not the right person to make statement on this. According to [comment 48](/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449#c48 "RESOLVED FIXED - Phishing vector via http auth of background connections") it is a safe to uplift.

We don't "need" to, but since it's blocking an abuse technique that's actively being used against our users in bad ads it would be very nice to take. The guts of the patch are actually quite simple, and it's got tons of telemetry and adds a pref so we can easily flip off the change if we have to.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
A HTTP Request is sent to the server (192.168.1.1), which responds with with a Set-Cookie (without HttpOnly flag) statement to set a cookie:
Example Response:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 287
Location: <http://192.168.1.1/webpage.php?id=1>
Connection: close
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45; path=/
<...>
The cookie PHPSESSID is set in Firefox, and the Browser follows the Location redirect to the webpage (same server 192.168.1.1) issuing the following request:
GET /webpage.php?id=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Referer: <http://192.168.1.1/login.php>
Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
This request results in the following response from the server setting a HttpOnly protected cookie (overwriting the existing one with additional HttpOnly flag):
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 303
Connection: close
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45; path=/; httponly
Vary: Accept-Encoding
<...>
Summary:
=========
"Upgrading/Overwriting" a normal cookie to a httponly flagged cookie.
Actual results:
The cookie is, although now flagged with httponly, still accessible via JavaScript:
PoC 1:
Web Console:
document.cookie
"PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45"
PoC 2:
also works via Cross-Site Scripting vector, aka:
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
-> resulting in an alert box disclosing the cookie value
Expected results:
After setting the httpOnly flag, the cookie should be protected from accessing it via JavaScript. This is a Cross-Site Scripting prevention meassure which seems to not work as intended anymore (worked as intended in earlier versions of Firefox, and works as intended in other Browsers (Chrome)).

Easy way to reproduce the issue:
Step 1:
-------
PHP script on a webserver:
<?php
setcookie("PHPSESSID", "123456", 0, "/", "", false);
//setcookie("PHPSESSID", "123456", 0, "/", "", false, true);
echo "<html><head><title></title></head>";
echo "<body><script>alert(document.cookie)</script></body></html>";
?>
Visit the PHP Script with the Firefox Browser.
Actual result:
Popup with cookie value.
Expected Result:
Popup with cookie value.
Step 2:
-------
Now comment the first setcookie line, and uncomment the second line and visit the webpage again. This line (last parameter setting HttpOnly to true) now overwrites the existing cookie with a HttpOnly protected cookie with the same name and value.
The HttpOnly flag is in fact set (can be checked by a HTTP proxy like Burp, or via a Firefox Addon like Cookie Manager).
Actual result:
Popup with cookie value.
Expected Result:
Empty Popup cause the cookie is protected by HttpOnly.

We seem to be creating \_two\_ cookies. The first, unprotected, cookie stays available to website script. The second httponly one is what we send in HTTP requests. Are we using httponly (and maybe other attributes) as a key to the cookie store?
The original non-httponly cookie is not visible in the devtools storage panel. Dev Tools seems to get the same (correct) view as network requests. Where is the bogus original cookie hiding?
This can be tested by changing the cookie value in the commented-out line of your testcase.Group: firefox-core-security → network-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → Networking: CookiesProduct: Firefox → Core

This also works fine if you disable multi-process.
Amy: could this be fall-out from [bug 1331680](/show_bug.cgi?id=1331680 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider not doing sync IPC for document.cookie getter/setter")? Just guessing that network code in the parent process updates the "real" cookies store, but because the new value is httpOnly we bail out before we sync the child process ("web content doesn't need to know about httponly cookies") and never tell it to drop the old value.Flags: needinfo?(amchung)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Hi Daniel,
Yes, this problem is the regression bug of [bug 1331680](/show_bug.cgi?id=1331680 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider not doing sync IPC for document.cookie getter/setter").
I will fix this bug.

Attached patch

[implementation -- Modified rejection timing when processing httponly cookie on CookieServiceChild.](attachment.cgi?id=8933187&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8933187&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1421324&attachment=8933187)

Hi Josh,
I found we didn't consider the situation as below:
1. Server side sets a non-httponly cookie whose name is test1, and test1 will store in hashtable on CookieServiceChild.
2. Server side modifies test1 to httponly, but CookieServiceChild will reject httponly cookie on CookieServiceChild::SetCookieInternal().
3. Still can access test1 through document.cookie.
I have modified above situation as below:
1. Removed if (aCookieAttributes.isHttpOnly) {return;} from CookieServiceChild::SetCookieInternal().
2. Moved the rejection the httponly cookie setting on CookieServiceChild::RecordDocumentCookie().
Would you help me to review my patch?
Thanks!

I would feel more comfortable about merging this change with a test demonstrating that it works as expected and does not expose HttpOnly cookies to document.cookie.Flags: needinfo?(josh)

Hi Josh,
I have finished the test case and found I have to do more modification as below:
1. CookieServiceParent has to send all of cookie-change to CookieServiceChild.
2. CookieStatus has to add isHttpOnly.
Would you help me to review this patch?

Hi Josh,
I have finished the test case, and security team suggested that us try not to create test case on security bug.
Base on this reason, I used feedback? on this test case, after f+, I will create new bug and r? this patch.
The steps of this test case:
1. Used XHR to set a cookie whose name is xhr1 and set it to non-httponly.
2. Modified xhr1 to httponly cookie.
3. This mochitest receive the notification from observer is earlier than CookieServiceParent sends the ipc msg of notifying CookieServiceChild to add/modify cookie.
base on above reason, the mochitest will confirm document.cookie can't access xhr1 after using document.cookie to set xhr2.
4. Confirmed document.cookie only accesses xhr2.
Would you help me to review this patch?

I was not able to reproduce the initial issue on old build Fx 57.0 using an Apache server and running the script following steps from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overwrite of existing cookie with HttpOnly flagged cookie results in HttpOnly being ignored by Firefox").
On both builds Fx 57.0 (that does not have this fix) and Fx 58.0 (that does have this fix) I'm getting the same result after running the script for the first time (Popup with cookie value) and for the second time after changing the comment (Popup without cookie value, empty due to HttpOnly).
Reporter, would you be comfortable verifying that the fix works for you on Firefox 58.0?

I reproduced the issue with the old (unfixed) Fx 57 (<https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/candidates/57.0-candidates/build4/win64/en-US/firefox-57.0.zip>) in multiple VMs. Maybe same issue as described in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overwrite of existing cookie with HttpOnly flagged cookie results in HttpOnly being ignored by Firefox") ?
Fix in 58.0 worked on my test system (Win10, x64, Fx 58.0), Popup empty.Flags: needinfo?(inko)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
