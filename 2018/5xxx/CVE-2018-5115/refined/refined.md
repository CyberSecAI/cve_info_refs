        "root_cause": "Background network requests, not associated with a page, could trigger HTTP authentication dialogs that would appear in the currently active page. The dialogs lacked the usual warning text, and could be triggered by HTTP requests that could be hijacked locally. This was due to the dialog being disconnected from the page content and not properly checking if the request was associated with a page.",
