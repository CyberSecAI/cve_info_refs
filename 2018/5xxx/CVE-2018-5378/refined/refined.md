Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-5378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) does not properly perform bounds checking on data sent with a NOTIFY message to a peer when an attribute length is invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)
- Lack of proper input validation when processing BGP NOTIFY messages, specifically related to attribute lengths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Arbitrary data from the `bgpd` process's memory can be sent over the network to a peer. This could expose sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `bgpd` process may crash as a result of the improper memory handling.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP NOTIFY message to a vulnerable `bgpd` instance. The message must have an invalid attribute length to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a vulnerable `bgpd` instance, typically as a configured BGP peer.
- The attacker needs the capability to craft and send malicious BGP NOTIFY messages.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is specifically within the `bgpd` daemon, which handles BGP routing.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when processing NOTIFY messages with invalid attribute lengths.
- The issue was addressed in Quagga version 1.2.3

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-5378 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the Quagga BGP daemon that allows a remote, unauthenticated peer to potentially disclose sensitive information from the bgpd process's memory or cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted NOTIFY message with an invalid attribute length.
