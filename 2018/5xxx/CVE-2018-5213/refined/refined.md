Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Simple Download Monitor" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize user-provided URLs for the "File Thumbnail" and "Downloadable File" fields within the "Edit Download" function. This allows users to inject malicious code within these fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable fields is stored in the database and executed when a user views the download details.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code to steal the cookies of other users, including administrators.
- **Account Hijacking:** With stolen cookies, attackers can impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and perform actions within the WordPress site.
- **Further Malicious Actions:**  The attacker can perform a wide range of actions, including redirecting users, defacing the site, and installing backdoors.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the "Simple Download Monitor" plugin.
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through the "File Thumbnail" and "Downloadable File" input fields within the plugin's "Edit Download" section.
- **WordPress Backend:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin panel (even with a low-privilege role like a contributor) and the ability to edit download items.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **WordPress User Access:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress site, even with low-level permissions like "contributor".
- **Plugin Usage:** The attacker must have the ability to use the "Simple Download Monitor" plugin.
- **Ability to Edit Downloads:** The attacker must be able to access the "Edit Download" functionality of the plugin.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the Simple Download Monitor plugin at the time of the report.
- The attacker could inject malicious code such as  `http://www.test.com/1.php'"><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)><'"` into the vulnerable fields.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.5.4 of the plugin by sanitizing the input using `esc_url()` and `sanitize_text_field()`.
