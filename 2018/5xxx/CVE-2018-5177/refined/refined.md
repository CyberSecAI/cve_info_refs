Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5177:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `txFormatNumberFunctionCall::evaluate` function in Mozilla's XSLT implementation.
- The function calculates a buffer size for formatting a number, using `log10` on a multiplied value.
- The value is checked to be not INF/-INF/NaN, before multiplication, but if the multiplier is large, the resulting value can turn into INF.
- Casting `log10(INF)` to an integer results in undefined behavior and a large negative number, which is then used as buffer size for allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Undefined behavior:** Casting an infinite value to an integer leads to undefined behavior in C++, resulting in unpredictable results.
- **Negative allocation size:** The undefined behavior leads to a large negative number that when cast to size_t becomes a very large positive number.
- **Heap overflow:** This is used as the allocation size of a buffer, leading to a heap overflow when `PRdtoa` writes data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The large allocation size and subsequent buffer overflow cause a crash due to memory corruption.
- **Potential code execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the bug report mentions a potential for exploitation, suggesting that a more controlled overflow might lead to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- **XSLT Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing XSLT stylesheets that use the `format-number` function with specific formatting patterns.
- **Malicious XSLT:** An attacker can craft a malicious XSLT stylesheet with specific numbers and multipliers to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web content:** This vulnerability can be triggered by loading a webpage that uses XSLT and has been modified with the malicious stylesheet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to control or manipulate the input XSLT data being processed. This could be done by:
    - Providing a malicious XSLT stylesheet.
    - Manipulating the XSLT stylesheet used by a website or application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges, and the vulnerability can be exploited through a standard web browser.
