  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "LibRaw incorrectly handled photo files, specifically within the samsung_load_raw, rollei_load_raw, and nikon_coolscan_load_raw functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Integer overflow",
       "Possible infinite loop",
       "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause applications linked against LibRaw to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted photo file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a specially crafted image file and trick a user or automated system into processing it using LibRaw.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability details are not fully disclosed, but the commit log and the USN indicate that the fixes were related to out-of-bounds reads, integer overflows, possible infinite loops, and stack overruns within the samsung_load_raw, rollei_load_raw, and nikon_coolscan_load_raw functions, as well as other parsing functions.  There were also fixes for handling of EXIF data and parsing of makernotes for various camera models, and general code cleanup."
