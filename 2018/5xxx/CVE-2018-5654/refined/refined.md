{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The WordPress plugin 'weblizar-pinterest-feeds' does not properly filter user-supplied data in several parameters, and lacks CSRF protection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious activities. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick an administrator into performing unwanted actions.",
     "attack_vectors": "The XSS vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript into specific plugin parameters. The CSRF vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTML form on a separate site that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, sends a request to the vulnerable plugin.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft an HTML page with a form that targets the vulnerable plugin's endpoint with malicious parameters. The attacker then needs to trick an authenticated administrator to visit this malicious page."
