  "CVE-2018-5143": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar",
    "details": "URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The browser's address bar input sanitization logic fails to remove the javascript: protocol when tab characters are included within the URL, specifically before the colon.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Self-XSS Vulnerability"
      ],
       "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious `javascript:` URL containing tab characters which can then be pasted into the address bar. The browser will then execute this arbitrary JavaScript code, which can have significant impact on the user's session or browser." ,
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a user pasting a crafted javascript: URL (containing tab characters) into the browser's address bar.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into copying the malicious crafted javascript: URL into the address bar. Social engineering is the primary technique required for a successful exploitation."

   "CVE-2018-5142": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs",
     "details": "If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states \"Unknown protocol\" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The Media Capture and Streams API permission prompts do not correctly inherit or display the origin of the requester when the request originates from `data:` or `blob:` URLs. Instead of showing the actual origin, the prompt displays “Unknown protocol”.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect origin display in permission prompts",
        "Lack of proper principal inheritance"
      ],
       "impact": "The incorrect display of the origin can mislead users into granting permissions to untrusted sources when they believe they are granting access to a trusted site, because the prompt does not properly indicate the origin of the requesting script or document. This is particularly serious when the top document is trusted but an embedded frame is not.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could embed a malicious script in a `data:` or `blob:` URL within a trusted page. When the script requests camera/microphone access, the user is presented with a misleading prompt, obscuring the untrusted nature of the request. This is primarily a social engineering type of attack, leveraging the misleading prompt.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to embed a malicious script into the page or load a page using data/blob urls which will then request media access. The attacker also needs to be able to persuade the user that this request is legitimate. "
