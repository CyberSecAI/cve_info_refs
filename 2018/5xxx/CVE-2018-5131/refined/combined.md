| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1433005#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

We discovered by accident that if from our remote WebRTC endpoint we send RTP packets with a correct SSRC and body but an incorrect PayloadType we can crash Firefox and cause invalid read/write or divide by zero exceptions.
The details of what we are sending are RTP packets with contents originally generated by a client using Chrome with opus/48000/2 contents, but the payload type from Chrome is 111 and we were inadvertently putting that into the payload type for the packet forwarded to Firefox rather than 109 as Firefox desired via the negotiated SDP for it. The Firefox client receiving the packet seemed to consider it valid, about:webrtc showed packets being received and no errors, various WebRTC logging in Firefox also looked happy, but fairly quickly we’d crash with one of the below presumably because the audio decoding was invalid due to incorrect payload type.
Once we fixed our server code forwarding these packets to set correct payload types all the crashes stopped, but this appears to be a remotely exploitable crash bug at the least with possible remote code execution potential if packets were carefully crafted and targeted? So just in case, I've marked this as a security bug.

This is all stuff in the media stack. We could maybe add some filtering logic in MediaPipeline that will strip out bad packets, but the fact that the media stack screws up the memory management when the payload type is wrong suggests that there are probably similar memory management bugs that will be triggered by bad payloads, which is something we can't check in MediaPipeline...Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)

We've fuzzed some video stuff, but this is audio data... probably we should fuzz audio inputs (feed in "Opus" data (and other codecs!) with fuzzed data (wrong/wrong-length/right-header-wrong-rest, etc). Most of these appear to be in NetEq, which is after the codecs; it would be interesting to see what the codecs are decoding to or if failure/sanity (output length) checks are missing somewhere.
Also check upstream for neteq fixes.Flags: needinfo?(cdiehl)

Yeah I was also thinking about checking for the PT type. But I don't get why the PT actually matters after the transport layer. So I would like to replicate to find out the root cause, rather then plastering over it.Flags: needinfo?(drno)

Actually, we're on [Bug 1341285](/show_bug.cgi?id=1341285 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update WebRTC code to webrtc.org stable branch 57"): Webrtc updated to branch 57 rev 52b6562a10b495; initial pull made Feb 2 2017 14:38 EST
They switched off SVN some time ago, so that file is no longer relevant.

Those may still be relevant, however. We can cherrypick if needed/useful.

See line 36:
sdp.replace(/a=rtpmap:\d+ opus\/48000\/2\r\n/g, 'a=rtpmap:111 opus/4800/2\r\n')

Attached patch

[Don't insert DTMF codec twice](attachment.cgi?id=8945831&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8945831&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1433005&attachment=8945831)

The problem was that we only had the DTMF codec present in the codecs array, so we would attempt to insert a second copy of it past the end of the array, and then resize the array to accommodate it. This moves the resize so that we are guaranteed to have enough space for any extra codecs we're adding. It also adds a check that prevents us from adding a second copy of the DTMF codec, as that leads to a use-after-free soon after.

This is getting hard to read. My suggestion is to:
1. Find each entry we want to use (the actual codec, the dtmf, the red, and anything else), and remove it from the codec array.
2. Empty out the codec array, deleting anything that is left.
3. Build a new codec array.

Might this be dtmf or ulpfec? We probably need to find by iterating, probably in the same loop that handles deletions below.

Does this mean that we should iterate through the array and take the first codec that is not dtmf or ulpfec as our preferred codec? Shouldn't the sort done at [1] make sure that the preferred codec is sorted ahead of dtmf or ulpfec? If not, should we fix the sort?

We are now keeping ulpfec as well as dtmf?
It might be safer to just fix the crash here and make any behavioural changes in a non-sec bug where things are easier to test.

That sort only causes "strongly preferred" codecs to override the preference indicated by the remote end. Unless prefs are set, there are no "strongly preferred" codecs. (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/062e1cf551f5bf3f0af33671b818f75a55ac497b/media/webrtc/signaling/src/jsep/JsepTrack.cpp#388>) So, you'll need to iterate.

It is easier to reason about this code's memory safety if we cover all the bases.

I wonder if webrtc.org is gonna barf if this isn't first? Should check this, or put it at the front using insert.

Simplify codec pruning in NegotiateCodecs
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Since the patch looks like a refactor, I don't think the underlying problem it fixes is that obvious.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All, the code was introduced in [Bug 1291714](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add signaling support for DTMF in WebRTC").
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I believe the same patch will apply to all branches. If not, the changes required should be minimal.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely, I would expect our standard unit tests to catch any problems.

Attached patch

[Fix up JsepSessionTest::ValidateAnsweredCodecParams gtest](attachment.cgi?id=8946708&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1433005&attachment=8946708)

I forgot to run the gtests before landing this. We're now keeping the ulpfec codec which breaks some of the tests in JsepSessionTest::ValidateAnsweredCodecParams. This looks like expected changes to me, but I wanted to double check just to be safe. Assuming this is fine, I'll roll this up into the main patch when I reland.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1555131#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-03-14 02:04:17 UTC  ``` Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2018-07

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 52.7

Announced
March 13, 2018
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 52.7

#### [#CVE-2018-5127: Buffer overflow manipulating SVG animatedPathSegList](#CVE-2018-5127)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow can occur when manipulating the SVG `animatedPathSegList` through script. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1430557](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430557)

#### [#CVE-2018-5129: Out-of-bounds write with malformed IPC messages](#CVE-2018-5129)

Reporter
James Grant
Impact
high
##### Description

A lack of parameter validation on IPC messages results in a potential out-of-bounds write through malformed IPC messages. This can potentially allow for sandbox escape through memory corruption in the parent process.

##### References

* [Bug 1428947](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947)

#### [#CVE-2018-5130: Mismatched RTP payload type can trigger memory corruption](#CVE-2018-5130)

Reporter
Tony Paloma
Impact
high
##### Description

When packets with a mismatched RTP payload type are sent in WebRTC connections, in some circumstances a potentially exploitable crash is triggered.

##### References

* [Bug 1433005](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433005)

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

##### References

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5144: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion](#CVE-2018-5144)

Reporter
Root Object
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An integer overflow can occur during conversion of text to some Unicode character sets due to an unchecked length parameter.

* [Bug 1440926](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440926)

#### [#CVE-2018-5125: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59 and Firefox ESR 52.7](#CVE-2018-5125)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Ralph Giles, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

STR:
1. Open nightly
2. Visit <https://http-cache-wanderview.glitch.me/>
3. Open network monitor and refresh to get it monitoring
4. Execute in console:
fetch('dontcache.txt', { mode: 'same-origin', cache: 'default' });
fetch('dontcache.txt', { mode: 'same-origin', cache: 'default' })
fetch('dontcache.txt', { mode: 'same-origin', cache: 'force-cache' })
fetch('dontcache.txt', { mode: 'same-origin', cache: 'only-if-cached' })
5. Go back to network monitor and check whether each request went to network or pulled from cache.
In nightly we go to network for the first two requests, but pull from cache for the second two.
Both edge and chrome go to network for the first three requests and fail the only-if-cached request.
This is a security issue because it could allow someone on a public lab computer to extract logged in page data from a previous user of the machine.
It seems we should not be able to see no-store/no-cache responses using fetch() force-cache/only-if-cached values.

You can see how we map the fetch API values to our load flags here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bd05e3853c6e982e2a35c1cc404b987b2bc914d6/netwerk/protocol/http/HttpBaseChannel.cpp#2885-2928>
We are using LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE for both force-cache and only-if-cached. Is there something else we can use to prefer the cache, but not access no-store/no-cache values? Any ideas Honza?Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

Note that this is the fetch() equivalent of [bug 1171853](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript") but without view-source involved.

Yes, it is, but that bug is more general.
For sake of this bug we could use VALIDATE\_NEVER instead of LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE for the force-cache case. It will use a cached content only when no-store is NOT present in cache-control. Otherwise will revalidate with the server.Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

Ok, but what about for only-if-cached case? Would that be `VALIDATE\_NEVER | LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE`?Flags: needinfo?(honzab.moz)

I believe so, yes. All other browsers implement it that way.Flags: needinfo?(bkelly)

Then the `VALIDATE\_NEVER | LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE` will likely work. If you are about to write a test (which I assume would be appropriate) you can then quickly verify.

I tested this with [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - fetch() force-cache mode allows reading responses with cache-control:no-store and pragma:no-cache") steps and it works! I will write a test.
I'm going to mark this sec-moderate. It can reveal information about a previous user sharing the same profile, but is not an issue for a single user browsing the web. The severity rating table suggests this should be sec-low, but since it includes access to potentially sensitive credential data (logged in bank page, etc), I'm moving it up to moderate.Assignee: nobody → bkellyStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Here are my test changes, but I think I will land them separately via an upstream pull request. I want to ask Youenn for review since he originally wrote the tests.

Honza, this patch switches us to use VALIDATE\_NEVER instead of LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE as you suggested. I verified locally that this works as expected.
I have WPT tests written as well, but I intend to land them separately after getting upstream review of them.

I'd like to leave the no-store comments out of the patch for now in the interest of not making the security flaw obvious on landing.

Make fetch API force-cache and only-if-cached use VALIDATE\_NEVER instead of LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE. r=mayhemer
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [Bug 1120715](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120715 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Fetch RequestCache")
[User impact if declined]: Public machines shared by separate users could expose information from logged out websites. So if user A checks their bank account and logs out, then user B later using the same machine may be able to use this bug to see some of their bank account information.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes, we have many WPT and mochitests for this feature. I have a new test case to catch this problem, but I will be landing it separately.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not yet. Its only been pushed to inbound so far, but I wanted to flag a bit early since we are getting close to the next merge date.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: Minimal risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The patch simply changes the code from using one necko load flag to another one that already exists in the tree. Its also a contained, easily testable feature. Our test coverage gives us confidence it does not regress the feature.
[String changes made/needed]: None

Make fetch API force-cache and only-if-cached use VALIDATE\_NEVER instead of LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE. r=mayhemer
A bit last minute for uplift but let's bring this to 59 RC since it looks like a simple fix, has test coverage, and protects user privacy on a shared computer.

Make fetch API force-cache and only-if-cached use VALIDATE\_NEVER instead of LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE. r=mayhemer
[Approval Request Comment]
If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
User impact if declined: Public computers (like in a lab or library) can leak logged in information from a previous user to a later user. For example, a user could try to see details from a previous user's banking session even if the previous user logged out. I'm asking for uplift to ESR because I feel public computers are more likely to be running ESR in the first place. I am holding off on landing WPT tests upstream until we can protect as many release channels as possible.
Fix Landed on Version: FF60
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Minimal. Its flipping a necko flag from one value to another. We have tests covering the feature to check for regression.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None
See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/ESR_Landing_Process> for more info.

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

#### [#CVE-2018-5142: Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2018-5142)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown protocol" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1366357](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366357)

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.
