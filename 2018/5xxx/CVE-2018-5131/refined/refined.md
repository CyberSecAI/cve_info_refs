Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2018-5131 vulnerability:

- **Title:** Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources.
- **Description:** The `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources sent with `no-store` or `no-cache` headers, instead of downloading from the network. This allows locally cached website data to be accessible to users sharing a common profile.
- **Root Cause:** The Fetch API was using `LOAD_FROM_CACHE` which did not respect the `no-store` and `no-cache` directives.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information of a previous user to a later user on shared machines. Websites' locally cached data may be accessible to other users even if the previous user had logged out.
- **Affected Component:** Firefox's Fetch API implementation.
- **Affected versions:** Before Firefox 59 and Firefox ESR 52.7
- **Fix:** Changed the implementation to use `VALIDATE_NEVER` instead of `LOAD_FROM_CACHE`. For `only-if-cached` mode, `VALIDATE_NEVER | LOAD_ONLY_FROM_CACHE` should be used. This ensures that resources with `no-store` are not retrieved from the cache.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Firefox 59 or ESR 52.7, or later versions.
- **Attack Vector:** A malicious website leverages the `fetch()` API with `force-cache` or `only-if-cached` to access cached data from other websites with `no-store` or `no-cache` directives.
- **Attacker requirement:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website and trick a user into visiting it. The attacker and victim also need to be sharing a user profile (e.g. on a shared computer).
- **Severity:** Moderate.
