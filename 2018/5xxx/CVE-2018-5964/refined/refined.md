Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5964:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The CMS Made Simple version 2.2.5 does not properly validate user-supplied input in the `/admin/moduleinterface.php` file, specifically within the `m1___messages` parameter. This lack of validation allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code within the `m1___messages` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameter is located in the `/admin/moduleinterface.php` file, which suggests an attacker would need to target an authenticated administrator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the vulnerable parameter.
-  Since this is a reflected XSS, the attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking the malicious link. This could be achieved through social engineering or by embedding the link in another part of the site that the admin might access.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server, but would need to target an authenticated user (admin).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `m1___messages` parameter is used after installing or uninstalling modules in CMS Made Simple.
- A proof-of-concept payload was provided as part of the exploit: `'>"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`.
- The vendor was notified, but they said they will not provide features for using admin permission.
- CVE-2018-5965 is also mentioned as a related issue.
