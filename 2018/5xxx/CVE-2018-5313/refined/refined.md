Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure file system permissions set during the installation of Rapid Scada 5.5.0. Specifically, the installation folder `C:\SCADA` grants excessive permissions to regular users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The installation folder `C:\SCADA` has weak access control.
- **Excessive Write Permissions:**  Authenticated users have write access ('M' - modify) and read/execute (RX) access to the `C:\SCADA` directory. This is further amplified for authenticated users to the subdirectories using the inheritance flags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit these weak permissions to overwrite or modify original files within the Rapid Scada installation directory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By replacing legitimate files with malicious ones, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, which can include Administrator, IUSR account, or SYSTEM.
- **Persistence:** Attackers can achieve persistence by replacing application components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where Rapid Scada 5.5.0 is installed.
- **File Overwriting:** The attack involves overwriting existing files within the `C:\SCADA` directory with malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user who can log into the system with at least authenticated user access. They do not necessarily need administrative privileges to initially exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files into the `C:\SCADA` folder
