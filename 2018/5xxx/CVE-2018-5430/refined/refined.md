Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the `page` parameter within the JasperReports application. This allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use "../" sequences in the `page` parameter to navigate outside of the intended directory structure.
- **Authenticated File Read:** Due to the directory traversal vulnerability, attackers can read arbitrary files within the filesystem hosting the JasperReports application.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Attackers can include and potentially execute arbitrary JSP files from the server's file system by exploiting the lack of input validation.
- **Bypassed Access Controls:** The vulnerability allows low-privileged users to access and execute administrative functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive configuration files, such as database credentials, which can be used for further attacks.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In a post-intrusion scenario, attackers can upload a malicious JSP file and then include it via LFI to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Bypass of access controls**: Low-privileged users can access administrative functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the `/jasperserver/flow.html` or `/jasperserver-pro/flow.html` endpoints, manipulating the `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the JasperReports application.
- Network access to the JasperReports server is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles the `page` parameter. It directly uses the provided value to build a file path without proper sanitization.
- The application appends `.jsp` to the `page` parameter. This can be bypassed by adding a semicolon (`;`) to the requested file, which prevents the addition of the extension and allows reading arbitrary files. For example, `../../../js.jdbc.properties;`.
-  The `getResource()` method within the application, specifically in `DirResourceSet.java`, is used to resolve file paths based on the provided `page` parameter.
- The vulnerability is located in the `HttpServletRequestParameterMap.java` at the `getAttribute()` function.
- The vulnerable code is located in `DirResourceSet.java`, specifically the `getResource()` function.
- The vulnerable code is located in `HttpServletRequestParameterMap.java`, specifically the `getAttribute()` function.
