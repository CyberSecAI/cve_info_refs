# Authenticated File Read Vulnerability in JasperReports(CVE-2018-5430)

Hector Monsegur

## Vulnerability Summary: CVE-2018-5430

TIBCO’s JasperReports (<=6.2.4, 6.3.0, 6.3.2-3, 6.4.0, 6.4.2, CE/ActiveMatrix BPM and Jaspersoft AWS with Multi-Tenancy/Reporting and Analytics for AWS <=6.4.2) is vulnerable to an authenticated file read and inclusion vulnerability by means of directory traversal. It is possible for an attacker, regardless of user permissions, to access or include files from within the filesystem hosting the application.

*CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)*

## Introduction: JasperResports Background and Security

In dealing with the day to day engagements, Rhino Security Labs’ consultants are introduced a variety of applications deployed in complex enterprise environments.  Our team is often tasked with auditing these production installations for various vulnerabilities. In a recent penetration test we encountered a client’s JasperReports Server – a data aggregation and reporting tool.

Here’s the description of JasperReports from the TIBCO website:

```
“Reporting and Analytics Server: JasperReports Server is a stand-alone and embeddable reporting server. It provides reporting and analytics that can be embedded into a web or mobile application as well as operate as a central information hub for the enterprise by delivering mission critical information on a real-time or scheduled basis to the browser, mobile device, or email inbox in a variety of file formats. JasperReports Server is optimized to share, secure, and centrally manage your Jaspersoft reports and analytic views.”

```

The process in auditing publicly accessible application is to review the  reported CVE and security disclosure history, looking for any areas of interest or current vulnerabilities that an adversary could leverage.

One such issue that came up was an information disclosure by means of directory traversal, file read access and the potential for JSP file inclusions. Three separate attack paths using one vector in this case.  Technical details are disclosed in this article.

While investigating JasperReports’ handling of paths in query parameters, out team  discovered it would be possible for an attacker to read files from the filesystem hosting the application. Albeit limited to within the WEB-INF directory structure, we determined that we could read sensitive configuration files, which can be abused for additional exploitation.

Exploring the core vulnerability itself, we did a deep dive into where the issue was located and potential abuse scenarios:

### Bypassing JasperReports Access Controls

The following example allowed us to include an administrator JSP from a low privileged user (joeuser):

```
/jasperserver/flow.html?_flowId=sampleFlow&page=../../../jsp/modules/administer/adminImport
```

Which took us from:

```
getAttribute() @ HttpServletRequestParameterMap.java:57
> string[] = wrapper.getParameterValues("page")
```

To:

```
getResource() @ DirResourceSet.java:101
> file = new File(/home/rhino/jasperreports...mcat/webapps/jasperserver,"/WEB-INF/jsp/modules/administer/adminImport.jsp")
```

Due to a lack of input validation we found ourselves with the capability to traverse paths to a destination of our choice. Below you will find more Proof of Concepts (PoCs) of the the attack in question:

### Accessing Administrator Export Functions

```
/jasperserver-pro/___________?{param}=..

```
### Accessing AWS Configuration Functions

```
/jasperserver-pro/flow.html?_flowId=sampleFlow&page=../../../jsp/modules/administer/awsConfiguration
```

The above issue allowed us to load privileged portions of the application geared towards the Administrator, thus bypassing access controls.

### Local File Read

The following command allowed us to read configuration files on the server, taking advantage of an unsanitized ‘page’ perimeter and reading configuration files. An attacker would use these credentials to further pivot across application and services. Although the above screenshot provides a randomly generated password for the occasion, we decided to blur it out of habit.

```
/jasperserver-pro/flow.html?_flowId=sampleFlow&page=../../../js.jdbc.properties;
```

![JasperReports Image]( "JasperReports Image")

### Local File Inclusion (JSP)

And in the event of a post-intrusion scenario, an attacker would need to upload an arbitrary JSP file, masqueraded as a regular file (sans .jsp) to the victims filesystem and execute something like the following via a local file inclusion:

```
/jasperserver-pro/flow.html?_flowId=sampleFlow&page=../../../jsp/modules/administer/file;
```

NOTE: Since the application appends ‘.jsp’ to the ‘page’ paramater value, normally you would end up with ../../../jsp/modules/administer/file.jsp. However, if we want to read configuration files we need to trick Java to read our desired file, and ignore the ‘.jsp’ addition. NULL bytes (%00) do not work, however we were able to bypass the problem by adding a semicolon to our desired file.

## Conclusion

With the issue at hand being patched, we felt it would be great to discuss the discovery process as well as the technical details and disclosure process for the aforementioned issue.

We were delighted to see TIBCO’s proactive response to the vulnerability disclosure and process. It is important for organizations with large applications like JasperReports to investigate, coordinate and disclose security issues as they come in.

At Rhino Security Labs, we put an emphasis on security research as part of our day to day process.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
