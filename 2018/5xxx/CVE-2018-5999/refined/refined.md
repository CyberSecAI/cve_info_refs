Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **HTTP Server Authentication Bypass:** The AsusWRT HTTP server has a flaw in its `handle_request()` function. It allows unauthenticated users to perform POST requests for certain actions, even if authentication fails. Specifically, the `handler->input` function is called even if `auth_result` is not 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated users can bypass the intended authentication checks for specific POST requests.
*   **NVRAM Configuration Manipulation:** By exploiting the authentication bypass, an attacker can send a POST request to `vpnupload.cgi`. The `do_vpnupload_post()` function is then called, which allows setting NVRAM configuration variables directly from the request.
*   **Command Execution:** A special command mode in the `infosvr` UDP daemon (port 9999) can be triggered by setting `ateCommand_flag` to 1 using the NVRAM manipulation vulnerability. This mode executes commands sent in a specifically crafted UDP packet as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router as the root user.
*   **Full Control:** Complete control over the affected router by the attacker, including the potential to modify any settings.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not specifically mentioned, the capability to run arbitrary commands could be used for denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive information that might be stored in the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access (LAN):** The attack is performed over the local network where the vulnerable router is connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable Asus router.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication, which means no valid credentials are needed.

**Technical Details and Exploit Flow:**

1.  **Bypass Authentication:** An attacker sends a POST request to `/vpnupload.cgi`, taking advantage of the authentication bypass vulnerability.
2.  **Set `ateCommand_flag`:** Within the POST request data, the attacker sets the `ateCommand_flag` NVRAM variable to 1. This enables the special command mode in the `infosvr` daemon.
3.  **Send Malicious UDP Packet:** The attacker crafts and sends a UDP packet to the `infosvr` daemon on port 9999. This packet includes a header and the malicious command to execute, specifically using the `PKT_SYSCMD` structure.
4.  **Command Execution:**  The `infosvr` daemon executes the included command as root. The exploit uses this to start `telnetd` on a random port, allowing remote shell access for the attacker.
5.  **Establish Shell:** The attacker connects to the newly opened telnet port and gains a shell on the router.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects AsusWRT versions prior to 3.0.0.4.384.10007.
*   The exploit can also be used to change the web interface password and enable SSH for RCE, though the provided exploit utilizes the `infosvr` daemon for cleaner execution without password changes.
*   The provided Metasploit module automates this attack by first setting the `ateCommand_flag` variable and then sending the `PKT_SYSCMD` to `infosvr`.

The provided information gives a clear picture of the vulnerability, exploitation process, and the impact on affected Asus routers.
