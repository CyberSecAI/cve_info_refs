Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-5124 is the injection of unsanitized HTML into the browser UI, specifically within Lightweight Theme (LWT) prompts and other areas that use `innerHTML`. The browser was not properly sanitizing input from sources like extension metadata (theme names, search engine names) before injecting them into the DOM, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary weakness is a chrome-level XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious HTML, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser's privileged context.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The code was using `innerHTML` to directly insert user-controlled strings without proper sanitization.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application failed to encode or sanitize special characters such as `<`, `>`, and `&` before using them to generate HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with chrome-level privileges, effectively gaining full control over the browser. This can lead to:
    *   Data theft.
    *   Installation of malicious extensions.
    *   Manipulation of user settings.
    *   Potentially, system-level compromise.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allowed for escaping the browser's sandbox, giving the attacker access to more privileged browser APIs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Lightweight Themes:** Attackers could craft malicious lightweight themes with specially crafted names that contain malicious code. When a user installs or interacts with this theme, the malicious script would execute via the vulnerable prompts.
*   **Malicious Search Engines:** Similarly, malicious extensions or websites could set up malicious search engines that would then inject their payload into the browser UI via the vulnerable prompts.
*   **WebRTC Screen Sharing Prompts:** The WebRTC screen sharing permission panel was also vulnerable, allowing for exploitation via its "Learn more" link.
*   **Other Vulnerable Areas:** Other areas such as EME notification bars, Fennec's about:config and GMP license information were also found to be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious Lightweight theme or control data injected into vulnerable prompts:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Lightweight theme, which can be distributed via websites or malicious extension repositories, or by controlling other data that is rendered by vulnerable functions.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to install or interact with the malicious theme, search engine, or trigger a vulnerable prompt for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Details (from Bugzilla):**

*   The vulnerability was found internally by Johann Hofmann while investigating another bug.
*   The vulnerability was considered a "chemspill" due to the severity of its impact.
*   The fix involved multiple patches, including sanitizing HTML fragments and replacing `innerHTML` with safer alternatives.
*   The issue affected Firefox desktop versions but not Firefox for Android or Firefox 52 ESR.
*   Multiple areas using `innerHTML` were identified as vulnerable and patched.
*   The fix was released in Firefox 58.0.1.
*   The bug report includes a test case (`testcase.html`) and several patches related to the fix.
