- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `command` parameter in the `index.php` file, allowing for arbitrary command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists in the `command` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to web-application, database management system, or web-server compromise. Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject system commands via a GET request to the `index.php` file, specifically targeting the `command` parameter within the callforward module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a low-privileged web-application user account. No user interaction is required beyond sending the crafted request. The attack can be performed by any user with access to the user control panel, including restricted accounts.
