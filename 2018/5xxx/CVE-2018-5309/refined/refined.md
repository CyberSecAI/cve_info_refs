Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a signed integer overflow in the `PdfObjectStreamParserObject::ReadObjectsFromStream` function within the PoDoFo library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The code does not properly handle large values when performing arithmetic operations, leading to a signed integer overflow. Specifically, adding a large number to an existing value results in a value that cannot be represented by the target data type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The integer overflow can lead to a crash, potentially rendering the application or system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDF File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted PDF file.
*   The `podofoimgextract` tool is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file.
*   The attacker needs to entice the victim to process the malicious PDF file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `src/base/PdfObjectStreamParserObject.cpp` file, specifically at line 99.
*   The overflow is triggered when the code attempts to add 94 to 9223372036854775807, which results in a value that cannot be represented as a signed `long int`.
*   The provided bugzilla entry includes a proof-of-concept (POC) PDF file that can be used to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by "probefuzzer."
