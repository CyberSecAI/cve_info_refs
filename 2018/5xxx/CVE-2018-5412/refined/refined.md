```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the SecureSphere CLI, where a command injection vulnerability allows for escaping the sealed mode and executing arbitrary code as root.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Insufficient access control",
    "Shell Escape"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user, potentially gaining complete control over the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker leverages the command injection vulnerability via the `impctl platform import` command within the SecureSphere CLI, accessible via SSH.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs valid credentials to login to the SSH service, or can be a less privileged user who has access to execute SecureSphere CLI commands."
