Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Octopus Deploy handles team and role permissions. Specifically, the `TeamEdit` and `RoleEdit` permissions, which are intended to be restricted to the `System Administrator` role, can be granted to lower-level roles or teams.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Management**: The core issue is that users with `TeamEdit` or `RoleEdit` permissions can modify their own team or role to escalate their privileges within the system.
- **Misconfiguration Risk:** The vulnerability is exacerbated when built-in roles are misconfigured or when custom roles are improperly created with these powerful permissions granted to less privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A user with lower-level permissions can elevate their own effective permissions to `System Administrator`, potentially gaining full control of the Octopus Deploy installation.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Once escalated, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the entire system, potentially compromising sensitive data and/or configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network**: The attack is network-based, requiring a user with network access to the Octopus Deploy installation.
- **Exploitation through UI or API:** The user would likely leverage the Octopus UI or API to edit their team or role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account**: The attacker needs a valid user account within Octopus Deploy.
- **Initial Permissions**: The attacker must have either the `TeamEdit` or `RoleEdit` permissions.
- **Low Privileges**: The attacker would likely start with low-level permissions.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue is present in Octopus Deploy versions prior to 4.1.9.
- The fix in version 4.1.9 actively prevents users from escalating their effective permissions.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management.
- The CVSS v3 score is 8.8/10, indicating high severity.
- The exploitability of the vulnerability is rated as low complexity and low privileges required
