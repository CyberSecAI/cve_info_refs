# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@distantcam](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1298847?u=70560f002354e91d02515e9da24261e3d43dc2c7&v=4&size=48)](/distantcam)[distantcam](https://github.com/distantcam)opened [on Jan 16, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4167#issue-288759124)

[CVE-2018-5706](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h574-pqf7-gvpf "CVE-2018-5706")

Octopus comes with a set of built in teams and roles and permissions. `TeamEdit` and `RoleEdit` are two very powerful permissions that are only granted to the built-in `System Administrator` role.

Some customers create their own teams and roles, or customize the built-in roles. If a customer grants the `TeamEdit` or `RoleEdit` permissions to a "lower level" role/team - members of that team can edit their role/team to escalate their effective permissions.

# Vulnerability

When the built-in roles have been misconfigured, or custom roles have been constructed and misconfigured, users in the misconfigured teams/roles can edit their team/role to escalate their effective permissions.

# Mitigation

**Prior to Octopus 4.1.9** Ensure the teams which are granted the `TeamEdit` and/or `RoleEdit` permissions are trusted to modify the effective permissions of any user in your Octopus installation, including their own. **The built-in roles and teams that come with Octopus follow this practice already.**

**After Octopus 4.1.9** Octopus will now actively prevent any user from escalating their effective permissions.

# Affected versions

Octopus Server up to `4.1.9`. Fixed in Octopus Server `4.1.9` and later.

## Description

[![@distantcam](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1298847?u=70560f002354e91d02515e9da24261e3d43dc2c7&v=4&size=48)](/distantcam)[distantcam](https://github.com/distantcam)opened [on Jan 16, 2018](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/4167#issue-288759124)

[CVE-2018-5706](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h574-pqf7-gvpf "CVE-2018-5706")

Octopus comes with a set of built in teams and roles and permissions. `TeamEdit` and `RoleEdit` are two very powerful permissions that are only granted to the built-in `System Administrator` role.

Some customers create their own teams and roles, or customize the built-in roles. If a customer grants the `TeamEdit` or `RoleEdit` permissions to a "lower level" role/team - members of that team can edit their role/team to escalate their effective permissions.

# Vulnerability

When the built-in roles have been misconfigured, or custom roles have been constructed and misconfigured, users in the misconfigured teams/roles can edit their team/role to escalate their effective permissions.

# Mitigation

**Prior to Octopus 4.1.9** Ensure the teams which are granted the `TeamEdit` and/or `RoleEdit` permissions are trusted to modify the effective permissions of any user in your Octopus installation, including their own. **The built-in roles and teams that come with Octopus follow this practice already.**

**After Octopus 4.1.9** Octopus will now actively prevent any user from escalating their effective permissions.

# Affected versions

Octopus Server up to `4.1.9`. Fixed in Octopus Server `4.1.9` and later.
