* [Bug 1433005](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433005)

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

##### References

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as `about:debugging`, if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open.

##### References

* [Bug 1408194](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408194)

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions may use `view-source:` URLs to view local `file:` URL content, as well as content stored in `about:cache`, bypassing restrictions that only allow WebExtensions to view specific content.

##### References

* [Bug 1429379](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429379)

#### [#CVE-2018-5135: WebExtension browserAction can inject scripts into unintended contexts](#CVE-2018-5135)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use `browser.tabs.executeScript` to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged `about:` pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1431371](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1431371)

moderate
##### Description

A shared worker created from a `data:` URL in one tab can be shared by another tab with a different origin, bypassing the same-origin policy.

##### References

* [Bug 1419166](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419166)

#### [#CVE-2018-5137: Script content can access legacy extension non-contentaccessible resources](#CVE-2018-5137)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A legacy extension's non-contentaccessible, defined resources can be loaded by an arbitrary web page through script. This script does this by using a maliciously crafted path string to reference the resources.
*Note: this vulnerability does not affect WebExtensions.*

##### References

#### [#CVE-2018-5138: Android Custom Tab address spoofing through long domain names](#CVE-2018-5138)

Reporter
rugk
Impact
low
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1432624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432624)

#### [#CVE-2018-5140: Moz-icon images accessible to web content through moz-icon: protocol](#CVE-2018-5140)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Image for moz-icons can be accessed through the `moz-icon:` protocol through script in web content even when otherwise prohibited. This could allow for information leakage of which applications are associated with specific MIME types by a malicious page.

##### References

* [Bug 1424261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261)

#### [#CVE-2018-5141: DOS attack through notifications Push API](#CVE-2018-5141)

Reporter
Zohar
Impact
low
##### Description

A vulnerability in the notifications Push API where notifications can be sent through service workers by web content without direct user interaction. This could be used to open new tabs in a denial of service (DOS) attack or to display unwanted content from arbitrary URLs to users.

##### References

* [Bug 1429093](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093)

#### [#CVE-2018-5142: Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2018-5142)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown protocol" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1366357](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366357)

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.

* [Bug 1422643](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422643)

#### [#CVE-2018-5126: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59](#CVE-2018-5126)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Sebastian Hengst, Jason Kratzer, Tyson Smith, Ryan VanderMeulen, Noemi Erli, Karl Tomlinson, Philipp, Gary Kwong, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[poc\_self-xss\_tab.html](attachment.cgi?id=8934026)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8934026&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
Build ID: 20171203100121
Steps to reproduce:
Usually, to mitigate the self-XSS via the address bar, Firefox removes "javascript:" string when "javascript:[XSS\_HERE]" URL is pasted to the address bar.
However, if there is a tab character between "javascript:" string, like "java[0x09]script:alert(1)", Firefox does not remove it although JavaScript is executed from that string by tapping the enter key.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached PoC.
2. Copy the string in the textarea.
3. Paste it to the address bar.
4. When the enter key is pressed, JavaScript is executed.
Actual results:
The self-XSS protection does not work.
Expected results:
The self-XSS protection should work.

[Patch v0.1](attachment.cgi?id=8934151&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1422643&attachment=8934151)

Given that we don't replace the URL unless we actually find it started with "javascript:", I think we can just aggressively strip all whitespace in that version of the string without causing undue alterations to "safe" strings. Yes, this will be annoying for "legitimate" uses that haven't been escaped. I'm... not sure I care about that? There are plenty of other, more sane ways to execute arbitrary JS. Marco, does that sound reasonable?
Per [bug 1402896](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402896 "VERIFIED FIXED - Specially-crafted JavaScript may be pasted into the address bar"), I expect this is sec-low and can be opened up. Dan?Assignee: nobody → gijskruitbosch+bugsStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)

java[0x09]script: is an invalid scheme. Why is that executing as a javascript URL? Seems to me like that's the fundamental problem.
For developers who really want to execute a javascript: URL stripping all the spaces will break their workflow completely, whereas before they simply had to restore the scheme. Maybe that's a smallish number of people and we could simply tell them "tough luck--use devtools instead", but I worry there might be other situations where magic scheme creation/concatenation will turn what was intended to be a search (because there's a space in it) into running something else.Group: firefox-core-securityFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Once again, validation errors do not cause parsing failure.
So no, I think this is valid URL input (unfortunately).
I would have preferred if the spec was less... accepting... of this type of input, but it isn't right now.

Can't they just URI-escape things?

We only do something if the post-space-concatenation starts with "javascript:" (possibly preceded by non-word characters). Seems unlikely that would happen for any legitimate non-search URL requests.

I would say that the fundamental problem is attempting to reimplement the URL parser in the address bar, but I think I've said that before and Gijs mentioned where were some problems with parsing first and then operating on the resulting structure.
Maybe we should start thinking about a different architecture here?

Is there a reason to not just strip spaces up to the first colon? That would solve both this problem and Daniel's concerns.

Well, it wouldn't match what the URL parser does. To match the URL parser you should not strip spaces. If you only care about the scheme you would need to remove leading CO control and space (U+0000 to U+0020, inclusive). Then split on the first ":" I suppose. Then remove any tab or newline (U+0009, U+000A, or U+000D) from the first segment returned. Then ASCII lowercase (i.e., not .toLowerCase(), unless you audit and are sure that no Unicode code point has a lowercase ASCII that's inside "javascript") the first segment. Then see if that first segment equals "javascript".
This is rather involved, which is why I think you should consider a better architecture.

well, we could probably try to make a URL from the string, and pick the scheme from there if that succeeds? Just throwing out thoughts, TBV.

Patch v0.1

> Yeah, I think that works, but I also recall Gijs having concerns.
I do have some concerns, but after more reflection, it's probably the best option right now.
Essentially, the ideal solution (IMO) is to check:
a) the pasted string
b) the result of the existing input value + pasted string once pasted (using selectionStart/End and manual concatenation)
and feed it through whatever process the URL bar would normally use to navigate to that URL.
Unfortunately right now, some of that process happens inside docshell.
For many reasons, it would be a Good Idea (tm) to switch to a situation where docshell never does any fixup for loads, and the only fixup that happens, must happen in JS land prior to handing stuff to docshell.
However, that's a project that would probably take months, require several very very old interface definitions to change plus the associated fallout, and has nasty corner cases because sometimes fixup currently originates from within docshell errors, and is done synchronously. Because the content process (where most web docshells live these days) doesn't have some of the information required for fixup (like search engine URLs), farming it out to the parent process requires sync IPC, which is terrible. Making it async would likely cause regressions all over the place because of assumptions we have about what happens when this type of situation occurs, when error pages load, etc. (also because error page loads are... weird). X-ref some of my comments in [bug 1375244](/show_bug.cgi?id=1375244 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove sync PContent::Msg_KeywordToURI IPC message").
Similarly, fixup is currently in a docshell C++ component and desperately needs to be migrated to a JS (or maybe rust) equivalent because C++ is a terrible language to do that kind of string mashup in. If we use a jsm and then migrate fixup out of docshell, that'll also reduce the amount of xpcom goop we end up doing for this, but see above - this is hard.
That's all without going into what autocomplete code does, which also manually invokes some fixup in some circumstances, I think (to determine whether something is a search or not).
I'll put up a patch to just use the URL constructor here, which is a small change. This is kind of sad because it does a full parse which is clearly a superset of what we need here, but I don't think there's currently an easy way around that without running into some of the downsides that have already been mentioned here.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Ugh. So it turns out, the other thing I forgot about when commenting here is that getting the scheme is all very well, but now we need the string without the scheme. Without processing all the other junk. Which constructing the URL doesn't help with, because it changes the rest of the input (e.g. by URI-escaping it).

This looks reasonable, but I'm not familiar enough with Services.io.extractScheme. Given the tests it seems like it should do the right thing though. You might want to test \r in the middle too and the full range of U+0000 through U+0020 as leading.

Last time I suggested someone should get backed out over TV failures I was told it's tier-2 and we don't do that... bit ironic. :-\
This is only failing on Linux and Windows, I guess there's a clipboard handling difference for those unicode bytes somewhere on OSX (which is where I tested locally...) vs the other OSes. I'll look later today.

(In reply to :Gijs from [comment #23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1422643#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - Self-XSS protection bypass with tab characters"))

Oh, my mistake - looks like this also failed on the "cl" tests on the 1 linux and 1 windows configuration it ran on, but not on the others because we don't run them on every push, and I missed this because everything was starred, the cl test abbreviations on Treeherder don't start with "bc", the failing log was from a TV job, and the tests view on treeherder has been disabled so I couldn't look for the test in any other straightforward manner...

Seems like both Windows and Linux don't like null bytes in their clipboard, and Windows also either doesn't like or transforms '\r' such that the clipboard test util code in the mochitest suite doesn't detect the copy as having succeeded, which then breaks the test. I'll modify those cases so we run it where we can but not, apparently, on Windows.

# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))
