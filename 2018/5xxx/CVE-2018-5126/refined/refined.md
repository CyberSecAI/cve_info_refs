Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5126:

**CVE-2018-5126: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: This CVE is a catch-all for multiple memory safety bugs discovered in Firefox 58, which were fixed in Firefox 59. The specific root causes vary by bug, but they generally involve issues like use-after-free, buffer overflows, and other memory corruption issues.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The content refers to "memory safety bugs", and some specific issues such as "memory corruption" and "heap-use-after-free" are mentioned in the list of bugs. These are low-level programming errors where memory is not handled correctly, leading to potential for exploitation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: The description states that "some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code." This indicates that successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the affected system.

*   **Attack Vectors**: The attack vectors are not specified in the CVE description itself, but the advisory states that these issues could be triggered by opening a malicious website. Therefore, a likely attack vector is through a crafted website or malicious content that exploits these memory safety bugs in the Firefox browser.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need the ability to craft malicious web content or a malicious website, and then trick a user into opening that content with a vulnerable version of Firefox. This implies a remote attack vector where the attacker does not need any prior access to the user's system.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided bug list from bugzilla.mozilla.org shows the variety of memory safety issues that are covered by this CVE.
* The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) associated with this CVE indicates that successful exploitation could lead to denial of service, sandbox escape, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution.

In summary, CVE-2018-5126 is a collection of memory safety bugs in Firefox that, if exploited, could lead to severe consequences including arbitrary code execution. The primary attack vector is a malicious website.
