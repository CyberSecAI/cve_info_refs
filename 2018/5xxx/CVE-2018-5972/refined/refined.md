Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5972

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via multiple GET parameters: `keywords`, `placeid`, `subcat`, and `cat`.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- This could lead to:
    - Database information disclosure (e.g., version, database name).
    - Data exfiltration (sensitive user data, etc.).
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    - Potential for further exploitation, such as privilege escalation, depending on the database user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/listing` endpoint.
- Vulnerable parameters in the GET request:
  - `keywords`
  - `placeid`
  - `subcat`
  - `cat`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities as the attack is on the `/listing` page.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit-db entry provides the following proof of concept payloads:

- **`keywords` Parameter:**
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    - Error-based SQL injection using `FLOOR`.
- **`placeid` Parameter:**
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    - Error-based SQL injection using `FLOOR`.
    - UNION query based injection.
- **`subcat` Parameter:**
     - Boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    - Error-based SQL injection using `FLOOR`.
    - UNION query based injection.
- **`cat` Parameter:**
    - UNION query based injection.

The payloads demonstrate how an attacker can manipulate these parameters to inject SQL code for various exploitation methods, like retrieving database information or exfiltrating data.
