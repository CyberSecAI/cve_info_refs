- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when processing crafted packets on Port 20547.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the PLC to enter halt mode, disrupting Ethernet functionality and requiring a cold start to restore the system. It can also disrupt communications with other connected devices, potentially leading to loss of system availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted packets to Port 20547.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and requires a low skill level to exploit. Network access to the vulnerable device is needed.
