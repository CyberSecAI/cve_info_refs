Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Navarino Infinity web interface has a script, `jq.php`, that is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**
    *   The `jq.php` script does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `rows` parameter, allowing for the injection of SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract data from the underlying PostgreSQL databases. This could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive information such as user credentials or other data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of Navarino Infinity via a crafted request to `jq.php` script using the `rows` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of Navarino Infinity.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, where the attacker does not directly see the result of the query, but can infer the result by observing the response times (e.g., using `pg_sleep()`).
*  The vulnerable version is Navarino Infinity web interface up to version 2.2.
* A Proof of Concept is provided demonstrating how the `pg_sleep()` command can be used to verify the SQL injection vulnerability.
