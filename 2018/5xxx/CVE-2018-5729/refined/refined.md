  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization within the MIT Kerberos kadmin utility when adding or modifying principals in an LDAP Kerberos database.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "An authenticated kadmin user with permission to add principals can cause a null pointer dereference in kadmind.",
      "An authenticated kadmin user with permission to add principals can circumvent DN containership check by supplying both a \"linkdn\" and \"containerdn\" database argument, or by supplying a DN string which is a left extension of a container DN string but is not hierarchically within the container DN.",
       "The system allows injection of tagged data intended to be internal to the database module."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could result in a denial of service (null pointer dereference) or the bypass of DN container checks.",
