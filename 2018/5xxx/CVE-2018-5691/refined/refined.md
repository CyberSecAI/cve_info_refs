{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure input validation of the firewall list name, allowing special characters. Insecure handling of Java frames, allowing cross-frame scripting. Insufficient output encoding of values after saving.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Application-side input validation vulnerability, filter bypass, cross-frame scripting, output encoding issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to malicious interaction with the firewall and potentially allow code injection.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the input of the firewall list name, attackers can inject malicious code or special characters. This can be done through requests in Java frames. The code can also be injected with a non-administrator account without write permissions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and manipulate input fields related to the firewall list name. The vulnerability can be exploited with non-administrator accounts."
