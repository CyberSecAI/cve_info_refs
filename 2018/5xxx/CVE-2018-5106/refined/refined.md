Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5106:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox's Developer Tools handles network requests for resources needed by the style editor, when a service worker is registered on the main page. Instead of bypassing the service worker, these requests were being routed through it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** The main vulnerability is that a service worker on a malicious website can intercept and access network requests initiated by the Developer Tools for resources from a cross-origin iframe. This results in the service worker potentially accessing sensitive information meant for the dev tools.
- **Improper Context for Requests:** The DevTools were making network requests using the top-level document's context instead of the context of the iframe document where the resource is being used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially leak style editor information of a cross-origin iframe being debugged, through a malicious service worker.
- The vulnerability requires the developer tools to be opened.

**Attack vectors:**
1. A user opens a malicious website that registers a service worker.
2. The user opens the developer tools, and specifically the style editor, for a cross-origin iframe within the malicious page.
3. The style editor makes network requests for resources (like CSS files) which are then intercepted by the service worker from the malicious site, thus potentially leaking style information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control a website where they can register a service worker.
- The attacker relies on the user opening the DevTools on a malicious page and opening the style editor on the cross-origin iframe.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that network requests made by DevTools for style editor resources use the correct document context (i.e., the iframe's document instead of the top-level window's document). This ensures that the requests are not routed through the top-level page's service worker.
- The bug report also highlights the need for DevTools to consistently bypass service workers in all situations.
- There is a regression test included with the fix, which involves a service worker and cross-origin iframes.
- It was determined to be a moderate severity issue as it requires the user to have devtools open.
- The fix was uplifted to Firefox 58 beta.

The provided information aligns with the CVE description which states: "Style editor traffic in the Developer Tools can be routed through a service worker hosted on a third party website if a user selects error links when these tools are open. This can allow style editor information used within Developer Tools to leak cross-origin."
