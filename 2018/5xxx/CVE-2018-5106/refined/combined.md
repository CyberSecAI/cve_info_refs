Attached file
[downloads-download-open.zip](attachment.cgi?id=8897851)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8897851&action=edit)

Tested on Windows 7, Firefox 55.0.1 (20170809080026) and Firefox 57.0a1 (20170815100349)
Extensions written using the WebExtensions API are usually shielded from the user's OS and filesystem.
An extension can save arbitrary data to the user's filesystem using downloads.download.
And with downloads.open, the extension can open the file. If the file is dangerous (e.g. .exe opposed to .txt), then normally there is a warning dialog to make users aware that a program is being downloaded and run.
However, this check is trivial to bypass.
1. Load the attached extension (e.g. download, unzip it and load it via about:debugging).
2. On Windows, the extension will open a cmd shell (and start mspaint) without warning.
(When I tested on Linux, a text editor was opened without warning)
What happens is that:
1. The extension calls downloads.download with a file name that ends with a NULL byte (e.g. "foo.bat\x00").
2. downloads.open ultimately ends up calling DownloadIntegration.launchDownload, where the download prompt is only guarded behind whether a file is "executable" [1].
3. isExecutable is implemented in nsLocalFileWin.cpp, as nsLocalFile::IsExecutable. When faced with a trailing NUL byte, the blacklist-based check fails (because "cmd\x00" is not equal to "cmd").
4. Then mimeInfo.preferredAction is set to system, and mimeInfo.launchWithFile is called. [2]
5. The system will ignore the NUL byte and treat the file as "foo.bat" and spawn a shell.
In Firefox beta (56), a user gesture requirement was added to downloads.open ([bug 1369782](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369782 "RESOLVED FIXED - Require user interaction for downloads.open()")), which makes this bug only a tiny little bit less severe (extensions can open tabs at will and it is not unlikely for the user to click or type within that page).
What should have happened is that the file extension was recognized as dangerous, either at the WebExtension layer in ext-downloads.js, or in nsLocalFile::IsExecutable in nsLocalFileWin.cpp

No, we should validate the file name instead, to avoid a number of other security issues like writing to Alternate Data Streams.
We had a long discussion about file name validation starting with the first part of [bug 1254327 comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=1254327#c14 "NEW - browser.downloads.download() doesn't handle redirects"), where I also asked to file a release blocker bug, but that was not filed and hence forgotten, and the conversation ended with [bug 1254327 comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1254327#c21 "NEW - browser.downloads.download() doesn't handle redirects").
The validation functions are not unified as I mentioned in that last comment, and moving them to a central place might make it easier to solve bugs like this, but you can also make a local copy first if you think it can help to solve the immediate issues in WebExtensions.

I'm not working on this and I have my hands full with other things for 57. In any case, I don't think I have the necessary background, I asked for more detail in the other bug Paolo mentioned but as he says, the discussion there petered out a long time ago.Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

This and a significant number of other potential issues with the file names should have now been handled by 1402279, though according to the guidelines we shouldn't link the bugs together as dependencies or comment in the other bug just yet. Panos still recommended commenting here to keep everyone in the loop.
I just verified that the attached proof of concept doesn't work in Nightly as expected. After considering this bug and weighing the risks, Sylvestre recommended not to uplift the other bug to Beta, to which I agreed, so this should be fixed in Firefox 58.

It sounds like we should close this bug per [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1390882#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebExtension can bypass warnings and run arbitrary programs with download.download & downloads.open"), but I'll leave that up to the sec triage folks.

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

##### References

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_13\_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/swnav.html>
2. Now go to <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/iframer.php?url=//www.bing.com/images/search?q=Edge>
3. Open developer tools and click on any error.
Actual results:
Resources required to show error details are fetched through service worker registered on <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/swnav.html>. Leaking cross-origin information.
Attaching PoC video since it might be difficult to repro.
Expected results:
Developer tool's traffic should not go thought service worker.

Okay, this issue is caused by Style Editor in Developer tool. You only need to open Style Editor to trigger the bug.

I can confirm that due to this bug the ServiceWorker sees the URLs for resources in cross-origin iframes.
These resources are fetched by the DevTools and should bypass the ServiceWorker.

I believe this is a devtools bug. They should be setting nsIChannel::LOAD\_BYPASS\_SERVICE\_WORKER on their network requests.

Or alternatively, the network requests need to be made from the iframes document context and not the top window's context. That will ensure the iframe's service worker (if any) sees the request but not the top level service worker.

This seems to fix it, but to be honest I don't quite follow the issue.
Aren't we going to be confused in some other cases, do we \*always\* expect to bypass service workers in all type of ressources displayed by DevTools?
And I imagine we should review everything to ensure we don't do another request like this.
Many codes now use fetch(), but we may still have custom request code somewhere else...

After thinking about this, [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408708#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Developer tool's traffic routes through service worker") might be better. Ideally we would use the same service worker used to load the resources for content.
Can you tell if the top level window is being passed instead of the iframe window for any of these fetches?

Ok, that makes more sense to me.
Here we ensure using StyleSheet document (here an iframe) intead of top level document we debug.
Still, we would have to review all our code to ensure we don't have this issue somewhere else.

Shouldn't this be this.ownerDocument.defaultView instead?

Good catch!
\* So. It looks like some other code would suffer from the same issue:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1c4da216e00ac95b38a3f236e010b31cdfaae03b/devtools/server/actors/source.js#382-391>
let win = this.threadActor.\_parent.window;
...
let webNav = win.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIInterfaceRequestor)
.getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation);
let channel = webNav.currentDocumentChannel;
principal = channel.loadInfo.loadingPrincipal;
...
let sourceFetched = fetch(this.url, {
principal,
...
});
Also, is principal enough?
When we pass this `principal` attribute we end up setting it like this:
channelOptions.loadingPrincipal = principal;
When we pass a `window`, we also do this:
channel.loadGroup = window.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIInterfaceRequestor)
.getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation)
.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIDocumentLoader)
.loadGroup;
\* We may also have issue on source map, but is sourcemap suffering from the same issue??
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1c4da216e00ac95b38a3f236e010b31cdfaae03b/devtools/server/actors/utils/TabSources.js#466>
let fetching = fetch(absSourceMapURL, { loadFromCache: false })
\* And may be also the request replay feature:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1c4da216e00ac95b38a3f236e010b31cdfaae03b/devtools/server/actors/webconsole.js#1668-1679>
let doc = this.window.document; // this.window is the top level document...
let channel = NetUtil.newChannel({
uri: NetUtil.newURI(url),
loadingNode: doc,
securityFlags: Ci.nsILoadInfo.SEC\_ALLOW\_CROSS\_ORIGIN\_DATA\_IS\_NULL,
contentPolicyType: Ci.nsIContentPolicy.TYPE\_OTHER
});
channel.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIHttpChannel);
channel.loadGroup = doc.documentLoadGroup;

Can you include a regression test for this? Seems you could register a SW for a nested cross-origin iframe that populates the body with something and then verify both content and devtools see the same value?

And also contributed a non-trivial test to cover this.

patch v6
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It involves having devtools opened, so I would not say it is easy.
Here, you have to have the style editor opened.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I'm not sure I get this question. bulls-eye?
The test very specificaly test this particular issue.
But the check-in and comments only say what we are doing and are not really highlighting a particular security issue.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
mozilla-release branch is affected, so all supported branches are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I haven't checked, but the files I'm modifying aren't actively modified, so it should be easy to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It may affect inspector and style editor, so it would be great to have these panel tested. But devtools don't have QA smoketest.

What about ESR-52 branch? That's really the point of the question since the whole point of ESR is supporting people with security fixes.
Since this requires a victim to open dev tools and click on error links I'm lowering the severity to moderate.Flags: needinfo?(poirot.alex)Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

sec-moderate, I don't feel the need to track this. Please request beta approval when you believe this has baked enough in nightly.

Attached patch

[patch v7](attachment.cgi?id=8935031&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8935031&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1408708&attachment=8935031)

Sorry, this bug dropped off my radar.
Looks like DevToolsUtils had an issue with requests coming from SW when running in non-e10s.
Patrick, please have a look at the new change in DevToolsUtils.
Accessing `nsIChannel.contentCharset` throws when accessing it for a request served
by a Service worker. That, only when running on non-e10s.
I didn't saw that first as we run non-e10s tests only on windows debug builds and I'm pushing to try only on linux.

patch v8
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Probably has always been around.
[User impact if declined]:
Leak cross origin information when a Service worker is involved \*and\* the style editor is opened.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes, most of the complexity of this patch comes from its test. The fix itself is quite simple.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Not yet by QA.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Would be great, [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408708#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Developer tool's traffic routes through service worker") describes a good STR.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
None
[Is the change risky?]:
No
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
Limited to DevTools, this code is only used by style editor and inspector.
The patch looks quite simple.
[String changes made/needed]:
NoneFlags: needinfo?(poirot.alex)

For security issues we normally don't land the tests until after the bug is un-hidden.
But, since they are already on trunk, may as well bring this to beta (should be in beta 11 or 12)
