Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Bugzilla's `report.cgi` handles image generation and queries. Specifically, it allows complex database queries to be performed via URL parameters. The vulnerability arises because of the way the system responds to those queries: If a query yields a result, an image is returned, if no result is returned no image is returned. This behavior, combined with the fact that `report.cgi` doesn't properly check referrers or content types, allows a third-party website to extract confidential bug information by initiating cross-site image requests and using the presence or absence of an image response to deduce information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the ability of a malicious third-party site to use a logged-in user's browser to extract sensitive data from Bugzilla by using the `report.cgi` script.
*   **Inadequate Referrer Checking:** The initial versions of the fix did not properly check the referrer, allowing for cross-site requests.
*   **Insufficient Content-Type Checking:** The vulnerability is also present due to not properly filtering content types which may be used to disclose information.
*   **Regex Search Leakage:** The regex search functionality within `report.cgi`, which allows for complex queries based on bug fields, is the root cause for the ability to leak the contents of bug fields. The issue is that the response, or lack thereof, can reveal information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive bug information, including summaries of security-sensitive bug reports. A third-party site can probe for specific text within bug summaries by crafting different queries.
*   **Compromise of Sensitive Data:**  The vulnerability can potentially expose other fields as well, as the extraction is not limited to just summaries of bug reports.
*   **Unintended Data Access:** A user with access to a private bug can have that bug's information leaked to a third-party.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Image Requests:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that crafts URLs to the vulnerable `report.cgi` page on the target Bugzilla instance. These URLs are constructed to query bug data using regex searches.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in Bugzilla user to visit the attacker's website. This user's browser then makes the malicious requests to the Bugzilla server using their active session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs to host a website or control content that a logged-in user will visit.
*   **Understanding of Bugzilla's `report.cgi`:** The attacker must know how to construct specific queries to `report.cgi` that target the information they want to extract.
*   **No Prior Access to Bugzilla Required:** The attacker doesn't need to have credentials or access to Bugzilla itself, they are leveraging a logged-in user's session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploitable without a user that is logged-in into bugzilla.
*   The fix involves enforcing restrictions on referrer and content types, and preventing information leakage via regex searching.
*   The issue affects multiple versions of Bugzilla, and required patches across different versions (4.4, 5.0, and master) to fix.
*   The vulnerability was discovered via a bug bounty program.
*   The final fix involves checking if the referrer of the request starts with the Bugzilla installation URL and checking the content type.
