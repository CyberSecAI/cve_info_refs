      "content": "The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3838-1) indicates that CVE-2018-5812 is a vulnerability in LibRaw. It states that \"LibRaw could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a specially crafted file.\"\n\nAdditionally, the GitHub commit log mentions \"fixed several bugs reported by Secunia team (adv 81800, Credit: Laurent Delosieres, Secunia Research at Flexera)\", which is related to this CVE and provides additional context for the fix.\n\nFurther detail on the specific vulnerability is found in the github diff for commit fd63302:\n\n1.  **Rollei Raw Loading Vulnerability:**\n   - **Root Cause:** A missing bounds check in the `rollei_load_raw()` function.\n   - **Vulnerability:** The `todo` array is accessed without ensuring that the `isix` variable is within the bounds of the allocated `raw_image`. If the calculated index exceeds maximum pixel count then a heap out-of-bounds write occurs, this is also mentioned in SA81800#4.\n   - **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service.\n   - **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted Rollei raw image file.\n  - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious raw image file to be opened/parsed by an application linked against the vulnerable libraw library.\n\n2.  **Samsung Raw Loading Vulnerability:**\n   - **Root Cause:** A missing bounds check in the `samsung_load_raw()` function.\n   - **Vulnerability:** The code calculates an index `idest` and `isrc` used to write pixel data to `raw_image`, but does not ensure they are within the allocated `maxpixels`. If these calculated values exceeds the maximum pixel count then a heap out-of-bounds write occurs. This is also mentioned in SA81800#1.\n   - **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service.\n   - **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted Samsung raw image file.\n   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious raw image file to be opened/parsed by an application linked against the vulnerable libraw library.\n\n3. **Raspberry Pi metadata parsing vulnerability**:\n    - **Root Cause:** The code does not properly check if the pointer returned by `strstr()` is valid, before dereferencing it.\n    - **Vulnerability:** If the string being searched for (e.g. \"ccm=\") is not found in `mn_text`, then `strstr()` returns a null pointer. If the code continues using this null pointer it will cause a crash.\n    - **Impact:** Denial of service, potentially code execution\n    - **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted image file with specific EXIF data.\n    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be opened/parsed by an application linked against the vulnerable libraw library.\n\n4. **`find_green` Vulnerability:**\n    - **Root Cause:** The function checks if `width > 2064`, but doesn't properly handle the case where `width` is 0 (zero) when accessing `img[c][col]`\n    - **Vulnerability:** If `width` is zero, accessing `img[c][col]` could cause a division by zero if `vbits` becomes 0 during the while loop, leading to a crash.\n    - **Impact:** Denial of service\n    - **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted image file with a specific width.\n    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be opened/parsed by an application linked against the vulnerable libraw library.\n\n5. **remove_trailing_spaces vulnerability**:\n   - **Root Cause**: Signed char is used in the isspace() call, which can cause undefined behavior with non-latin characters.\n   - **Vulnerability**: The `isspace()` function when called with a signed char may cause an issue with negative values not being correctly identified. This is especially prominent when parsing non-Latin characters, it may cause it to terminate prematurely or skip over characters that should be removed.\n   - **Impact:** May cause the application to misbehave when parsing non-latin camera make/model strings or potentially denial of service.\n   - **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted image file with specific EXIF data.\n   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to be opened/parsed by an application linked against the vulnerable libraw library.\n\nThe patch addresses these vulnerabilities by adding additional bounds checks and also fixing the `isspace()` usage."
