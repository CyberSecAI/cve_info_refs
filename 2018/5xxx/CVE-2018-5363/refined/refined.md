Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the WPGLOBUS WordPress plugin:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of Stored XSS vulnerabilities were found in the plugin's settings page. Specifically, several parameters related to language settings, selector options, and post types were vulnerable to XSS injection.
    *   `wpglobus_option[enabled_languages][en]` (and similar language codes like fr)
    *   `wpglobus_option[more_languages]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[selector_wp_list_pages][show_selector]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[post_type][post]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[post_type][page]`
    *    `wpglobus_option[browser_redirect][redirect_by_language]`

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin's options update functionality lacks CSRF protection. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions, such as saving malicious data.

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the settings page before storing it in the database. This lack of input validation enables attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin does not implement any CSRF protection mechanisms, like nonce validation, for its option update form. This lack of protection enables cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into various parameters within the plugin's settings page. This malicious script is then stored in the database and executed when an admin views the settings page or where the data is used in the front end.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers a form submission to the vulnerable plugin's settings update endpoint. This allows the attacker to make changes to the plugin's options without the administrator's direct knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Administrative control
*   **CSRF:** Combined with stored XSS, this could allow an attacker to gain full control of the WordPress site. An attacker can use CSRF to inject a payload, and XSS to execute that payload in an admin's context.
    *   Manipulate the website's content.
    *   Change admin user settings
    *   Add/remove admin accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious HTML page under their control to exploit the CSRF vulnerability. For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to submit crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication to submit malicious POST requests, thanks to the lack of CSRF protection.
*  The attacker needs to discover the vulnerable parameters in the POST request, but these were provided in the content

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) HTML demonstrates how to exploit both the CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities together.
*   The vulnerabilities were tested on WordPress version 4.9.1 and the latest version of the WPGLOBUS plugin at the time the report was written.
