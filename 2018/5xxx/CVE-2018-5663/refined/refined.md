{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress plugin 'responsive-coming-soon-page' does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the settings page, and lacks CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the admin user's session. The attacker can also manipulate the plugin settings via CSRF attacks, potentially gaining full control over the site if the admin is tricked into visiting a malicious webpage.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript is injected into plugin settings, which is then executed in the admin panel when an admin views or interacts with these settings.",
    "CSRF: A malicious webpage uses a form to submit crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin's settings page, exploiting the admin's existing session."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For Stored XSS: The attacker needs to be able to access and save the plugin's settings page. For CSRF: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link."
