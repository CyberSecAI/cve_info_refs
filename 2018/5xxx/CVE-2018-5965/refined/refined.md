Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-5965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization of the `m1___errors` parameter in the `/admin/moduleinterface.php` script of CMS Made Simple version 2.2.5. This allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application reflects user-supplied input directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session who clicks on a crafted malicious link or the attacker can redirect the user to the crafted url via other means.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to phishing sites or other malicious activities.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker might deface the website by injecting malicious HTML or javascript code.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to distribute malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes a payload within the `m1___errors` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely need to socially engineer the victim into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`m1___errors`) and the path (`/admin/moduleinterface.php`).
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to create a URL that injects malicious JavaScript code.
- **Ability to Entice Victim:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to click the malicious link or open the crafted url.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a specific example of a malicious URL:
  ```
  GET /cmsms-2.2.5-install/admin/moduleinterface.php?mact=DesignManager,m1_,defaultadmin,0&_sk_=ba5e56a6aa91ad93f43&m1___activetab=templates&m1___errors=a%27%3E%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(1)%3E
  ```
  This URL demonstrates how an attacker can insert the payload `a'><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` into the `m1___errors` parameter to trigger the XSS.
- The vulnerability affects CMS Made Simple version 2.2.5 and possibly earlier versions.
- The content also mentions that the vendor stated they would not address the issue due to it requiring admin permissions, which prompted the researcher to report it to MITRE and be assigned CVEs.
