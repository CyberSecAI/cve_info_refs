Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of TLS certificate verification by Rubrik CDM when accessing vCenter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing SSL Certificate Validation:** Rubrik CDM versions 3.x and 4.x prior to 4.0.4-p2 do not validate TLS certificates presented by vCenter servers. This lack of validation allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of User Credentials:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of Rubrik user credentials configured to access vCenter. This could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to vCenter and potentially other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the Rubrik CDM system and a vCenter server can intercept and modify traffic due to the lack of certificate verification.
 
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Rubrik CDM and the vCenter server. This typically implies an attacker on the same network or in a position to perform a MitM attack.
- **No specific authentication is mentioned for the attack itself, but access to vCenter using Rubrik credentials is the ultimate goal.**

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Rubrik CDM versions 3.x and 4.0.x before 4.0.4-p2.
*   Rubrik recommends upgrading to version 4.0.4-p2 or later to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and coordinated with Rubrik by Thorsten Tuellmann.
