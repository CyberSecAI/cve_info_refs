{
  "CVE-2018-5180": {
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur during WebGL operations. While this results in a potentially exploitable crash, the vulnerability is limited because the memory is freed and reused in a brief window of time during the freeing of the same callstack.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how `TlsScope` manages its pointer in `mozilla::WebGLContext::DrawElementsInstanced`. A raw pointer was being used instead of a weak pointer leading to a use-after-free condition when the object was freed on the same callstack before the `TlsScope` destructor was called.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A potentially exploitable crash could occur, though the window for exploitation is limited due to the UAF occurring on the same callstack, restricting the ability to gain code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage using WebGL operations can trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to get the user to load a malicious web page in Firefox."
