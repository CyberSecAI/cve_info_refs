Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the in-browser editing feature of Bitbucket Server, which allows an authenticated user to manipulate symbolic links within a repository.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of symbolic links within the in-browser editor.
- Lack of sufficient validation when editing files, enabling the creation or modification of symbolic links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the symbolic link manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the in-browser editing feature of Bitbucket Server.
- An attacker needs to have a valid user account with the ability to access and edit files within a repository.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Bitbucket Server.
- The attacker needs to have permission to access and edit files within a repository.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify symbolic links within the repository through the in-browser editor.

**Affected Versions:**
*   4.13.0 <= version < 5.4.8
*   5.5.0 <= version < 5.5.8
*   5.6.0 <= version < 5.6.5
*   5.7.0 <= version < 5.7.3
*  5.8.0 <= version < 5.8.2

**Fixed Versions:**
*   5.4.8
*   5.5.8
*   5.6.5
*   5.7.3
*   5.8.2
*   5.9.0

**Mitigation:**
If an upgrade is not immediately possible, the following can be done:
1. Set `feature.file.editor=false` in the `bitbucket.properties` file.
2. Restart Bitbucket Server.

It's important to note that disabling the in-browser editor doesn't prevent exploitation of the same vulnerability via third-party plugins that use the file editing API.
