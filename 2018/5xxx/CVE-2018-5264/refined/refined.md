- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way the UniFi hotspot handles guest authentication and time allocation. A malicious user can manipulate the system by using another user's MAC address to claim free time.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper validation or association of the time allocation with the actual user. The system uses the MAC address provided in the request to start the free time. This MAC address is vulnerable to spoofing
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by stealing the free time allocated to other users. This can also cause a denial of service in the hotspot manager.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the hotspot login page, using a victim's MAC address. Then, the attacker uses the cookie from that request to send a crafted HTTP POST request for starting free time.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable UniFi hotspot, and they need to know the MAC address of the targeted user. The attacker does not need any credentials to perform the attack.
