This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8964028&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1450345&attachment=8964028)

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") +++
As reported in [bug 1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"), form submission can still happen in Thunderbird. I thought that was disabled, but it turns out we missed the one case, that you can submit a form with <button type="submit"> too.
Normally, as soon as the user clicks any form element we just open the for action in the browser (as a GET). This is how it's been for ages. The idea is to prevent users from bing tricked into submitting info to wrong places.
As a test case, try the eml in <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8930485>. Once entering the form area, the browser should open and by that prevent further interaction with the form inside thunderbird.

Not a totally hard review ;-) I tested with the given test case and click invokes the browser.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, install lightweight themes without user

interaction, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5178](/security/CVE-2018-5178))

An issue was discovered when processing message headers in Thunderbird. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application hang. ([CVE-2018-5161](/security/CVE-2018-5161))

It was discovered encrypted messages could leak plaintext via the src

attribute of remote images or links. An attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5162](/security/CVE-2018-5162))

It was discovered that the filename of an attachment could be spoofed. An

attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking the user in to opening

an attachment of a different type to the one expected. ([CVE-2018-5170](/security/CVE-2018-5170))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5183](/security/CVE-2018-5183))

It was discovered that S/MIME encrypted messages with remote content could

leak plaintext via a chosen-ciphertext attack. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5184](/security/CVE-2018-5184))

It was discovered that plaintext of decrypted emails could leak by

submitting an embedded form. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5185](/security/CVE-2018-5185))

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.

When a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.11; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20180206200532
Steps to reproduce:
I. The bug
In nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertFromByteArray (ff-esr52/intl/uconv/nsScriptableUConv.cpp), the malloc() size argument on line 148 is computed from an unbounded integer value, which can overflow:
134:nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertFromByteArray(const uint8\_t\* aData,
135: uint32\_t aCount,
136: nsAString& \_retval)
137:{
138: if (!mDecoder)
139: return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
140:
141: nsresult rv = NS\_OK;
142: int32\_t inLength = aCount;
143: int32\_t outLength;
144: rv = mDecoder->GetMaxLength(reinterpret\_cast<const char\*>(aData),
145: inLength, &outLength);
146: if (NS\_SUCCEEDED(rv))
147: {
148: char16\_t\* buf = (char16\_t\*)malloc((outLength+1) \* sizeof(char16\_t));
149: if (!buf)
150: return NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
151:
152: rv = mDecoder->Convert(reinterpret\_cast<const char\*>(aData),
153: &inLength, buf, &outLength);
154: if (NS\_SUCCEEDED(rv))
155: {
156: buf[outLength] = 0;
157: if (!\_retval.Assign(buf, outLength, mozilla::fallible)) {
158: rv = NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY;
159: }
160: }
161: free(buf);
162: return rv;
163: }
164: return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
165:
166:}
The outLength value is provided by GetMaxLength() (line 144), which is a member of nsIUnicodeDecoder class, and represented by nsUTF8ToUnicode::GetMaxLength in this case (see [bug#1440926](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440926 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overflow in nsUnicodeToBIG5::GetMaxLength can create memory-safety bugs in callers") for some background analysis of this family of classes). It is computed as the length of aData passed from the caller, plus 1.
Consider for instance, that the length of aData is INT32\_MAX-1. Then outLength will be INT32\_MAX and will overflow on the addition operation (line 148), and become -2147483648. Then the multiplication operation by 2 (sizeof(char16\_t)) will overflow it again, and the result will be truncated to zero and passed as an argument to malloc().
Here is an output of a simple test program written in C and compiled with Clang (Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)), which demostrates the effect of the unchecked integer arithmetic in this code:
$ ./a.out
INT32\_MAX + 1 = -2147483648 (0x80000000)
(INT32\_MAX + 1) \* 2 = 0 (0x0)
Next, nsUTF8ToUnicode::Convert() on line 152 will populate the zero-sized buffer with unicode data derived from aData, using the original value of outLength (which is still INT32\_MAX) as the bound. That will lead to overwrite of unowned memory which immediately follows the buffer, with caller-controlled data.
II. Reachability analysis
The only place where nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertFromByteArray is used in core code is nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertToUnicode. Both functions are directly exposed to privileged Javascript in Firefox. Therefore, I have identified 3 possible attack vectors:
1. Via a malicious extension
Privileged Javascript can obtain an instance of nsScriptableUnicodeConverter via Components.classes class factory, as such:
var converter = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/intl/scriptableunicodeconverter"]
.createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter);
And then call the ConvertToUnicode/ConvertFromByteArray functions directly with an arbitrary String or a TypedArray.
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter>
2. (1) implies that all Firefox installations which have installed an legitimate extension which uses nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter are affected.
The specific attack vector in this case depends on how the extension uses the class, however it's likely to operate on user-controlled data. (See [bug#289947](/show_bug.cgi?id=289947 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertToUnicode is not able to handle error in conversion") for example of such an extension and the user-controlled data which it processed)
3. There is a number of places in the components of Firefox written in Javascript, which instantiate and use nsScriptableUnicodeConverter for their own purposes.
Notably devtools, password manager, settings, and import of bookmarks:
nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertToUnicode:
./browser/base/content/test/urlbar/browser\_urlbarCopying.js:12: return converter.ConvertToUnicode(input);
./devtools/client/debugger/content/views/sources-view.js:307: unicodeUrl = NetworkHelper.convertToUnicode(unescape(fullUrl));

./devtools/shared/DevToolsUtils.js:472: // the guess is wrong, the conversion fails and convertToUnicode returns
./devtools/shared/DevToolsUtils.js:477: let unicodeSource = NetworkHelper.convertToUnicode(source, charset);
./devtools/shared/transport/packets.js:165: json = unicodeConverter.ConvertToUnicode(json);
./devtools/shared/webconsole/network-helper.js:87: convertToUnicode: function (text, charset) {

./toolkit/identity/tests/unit/test\_crypto\_service.js:107: let result = utf8Converter.ConvertToUnicode(base64UrlDecode(target));
nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertFromByteArray:
./toolkit/components/places/BookmarkJSONUtils.jsm:203: let jsonString = converter.convertFromByteArray(aResult,
./toolkit/components/places/BookmarkJSONUtils.jsm:240: let jsonString = converter.convertFromByteArray(aResult, aResult.length);
./toolkit/components/places/tests/bookmarks/test\_1016953-renaming-uncompressed.js:38: let jsonString = converter.convertFromByteArray(result, result.length);
./toolkit/components/places/tests/bookmarks/test\_1016953-renaming-uncompressed.js:68: let jsonString = converter.convertFromByteArray(result, result.length);
For example, BookmarkJSONUtils.jsm calls convertFromByteArray while importing bookmarks, with the data obtained from either a compressed file or an URL, which can be provided by an attacker.
III. Exploitability
With an arbitrary heap overflow and some prior heap grooming, it's possible to overwrite metadata of some object (a storage slot of an Array, for example) and thereby obtain an arbitrary read-write exploitation primitive, which can be leveraged into both an info-leak and arbitrary code execution.
The bug was confirmed with the latest release source code of Firefox ESR.

Given the comment there and what computation GetMaxLength can do in the bytes to UTF-16 direction, this is not exploitable using JS string input. There is so much abstraction in SpiderMonkey that Searchfox loses track. Hence, I timed out trying to figure out the possible max length of a Uint8Array. I'll try to find someone who knows where I should look.

It seems that it's possible to have an Uint8Array whose length is INT32\_MAX. To materialize one in practice, you need a 64-bit build, of course.
It looks like we no longer keep a searchable view of the add-ons on AMO--at least not at the previous location, so I can't search through the source of legacy add-ons for existence proof of a legacy add-on that used this API with an Uint8Array.
But if one existed and took 2 GB of attacker-supplied input into the Uint8Array somehow (in a 64-bit build), I don't see why the attack described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1443891#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in nsScriptableUnicodeConverter::ConvertFromByteArray can cause a heap buffer overflow") wouldn't be possible.Flags: needinfo?(hsivonen)

I think Henri's point is that well-intentioned legacy add-ons that wouldn't otherwise do anything untoward might be (and make us) vulnerable to exploitation because of this bug.

Check for overflow
[Approval Request Comment]
> If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration:
This has been rated moderate and it's doubtful whether the conditions for exploiting the bug ever exist in the wild. Most notably, it's unclear if a legacy extension that calls nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter.convertFromByteArray() with Uint8Array argument exists. However, if the conditions existed in the wild, this would lead to sec-critical-like consequences.
> User impact if declined:
If
\* The user is using a 64-bit ESR build
AND
\* A legacy extension that converts a JavaScript Uint8Array to a JS string using nsIScriptableUnicodeConverter.convertFromByteArray() exists.
AND
\* The user has the extension installed.
AND
\* The extension reads an unbounded amount of attacker-provided input into the Uint8Array.
AND
\* The attacker has previously caused the Firefox process to get a contiguous range of 1.3 GB or more of writable pages mapped to the addresses starting from the address that jemalloc returns for a zero-sized or tiny allocation. (AFAICT, otherwise the step of trying to convert 2 GB of bytes into UTF-16 gets the process terminated on accessing a write-only page or an unmapped page before anything worse can happen. I don't know how many write-only guard pages we sprinkle around.)
THEN
Memory-safety ensues, the attacker gets to overwrite a massive part of the heap with almost any data of the attackers choice (any byte pattern except unpaired surrogates) and the usual badness that comes with such overwriting is possible.
> Fix Landed on Version:
This was fixed in 56 in a different way. This ESR-only patch hasn't landed (and won't land) on any non-ESR branch.
> Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky):
Extremely low risk.
> String or UUID changes made by this patch:
None.

Considering that this is not going to land on trunk regardless of ESR approval, are the request flags here such that this shows up on the right queries?

Going to minus for the bug bounty because there's no risk to most Firefox. Users would have to have installed an unintentionally malicious legacy add-on (it it's intentionally malicious it already has all the power) that uses this feature in a way content can influence.Flags: sec-bounty? â†’ sec-bounty-

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows wonâ€™t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Alex Gaynor, Ronald Crane, Julian Hector, Kannan Vijayan, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
