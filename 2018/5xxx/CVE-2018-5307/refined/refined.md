## Analysis of CVE-2018-5307

Based on the provided information, CVE-2018-5307 refers to multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager version 2.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The `repoId` and `format` parameters of the `healthCheckFileDetail` function are vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could lure a user into clicking a crafted link containing a malicious JavaScript payload.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. If the user has sufficient permissions, the attacker could create arbitrary (administrative) users or perform stored XSS attacks.
*   **Stored XSS:** Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities exist:
    *   **File Upload:** Uploading a file with JavaScript code in its name via the "Staging Upload" functionality allows storing malicious code that gets triggered every time the filename is displayed.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Upload a file with a malicious filename.
        *   **Impact:** JavaScript payload gets executed every time the filename is displayed.
    *   **Stored DOM Injection (Username):**  JavaScript/HTML code can be injected into the username when creating a new user. This code gets rendered/executed every time the username is displayed.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious JavaScript in the username field during user creation.
        *   **Impact:** Payload is executed every time the username is displayed.
    *   **Stored DOM Injection (IQ Server URL):** JavaScript/HTML code can be injected into the "IQ Server URL" field in the "IQ Server Connection". This injects code into the menu bulletpoint "IQ Server Dashboard".
        *   **Attack Vector:** Inject JavaScript code into the "IQ Server URL" field.
        *   **Impact:** The payload is executed every time someone logs into the application.

**Affected Versions:**

*   <=2.14.5

**Fixed Version:**
