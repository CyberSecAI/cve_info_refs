Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5976:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the "RSVP Invitation Online 1.0" web application when updating admin passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests made to the password update functionality. This allows an attacker to craft malicious HTML that, when loaded by a victim logged into the application, will execute a password update without their consent or knowledge.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Modification:** An attacker can change the administrator password, effectively locking the legitimate admin out of the system and gaining control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts malicious HTML code (as shown in the exploit code provided) that contains a form submission targeting the vulnerable password update endpoint.
- The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into opening the malicious HTML page (e.g., via a phishing email or malicious website).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file or inject HTML into a website that a logged-in administrator might visit.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication with the vulnerable web application, only to trick an authenticated admin into visiting the page.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can use a simple HTML form to change the admin password by leveraging the lack of CSRF protection.
- The vulnerable application is "RSVP Invitation Online 1.0."
- The vendor's homepage was listed as `http://putrazendrato.link/` at the time of the report, and the software was available on CodeGrape at the given URL.
