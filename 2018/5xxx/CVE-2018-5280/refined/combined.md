Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Achieve a deeper level of security with the SonicWALL Network Security Appliance (NSA) Series of next-generation firewalls. NSA Series appliances
integrate automated and dynamic security capabilities into a single platform, combining the patented1, SonicWALL Reassembly Free Deep Packet
Inspection (RFDPI) firewall engine with a powerful, massively scalable, multi-core architecture. Now you can block even the most sophisticated
threats with an intrusion prevention system (IPS) featuring advanced anti-evasion capabilities, SSL decryption and inspection, and network-based
malware protection that leverages the power of the cloud.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent input validation web vulnerabilities and a filter bypass issue has been discovered in the official SonicWall SoniOS NSA UTM Web-Firewall Series.
The issue allows remote attackers and privileged user accounts to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to the affected modules to
compromise the web-application or user session data.
The peristent exploitable validation vulnerabilities are located in the `Host Name / IP Address`, `Client Name/IP Address` and `Proxy Forward To` input fields of
the `Users - Settings - Configure SSO` web appliance module. Remote attackers and low privileged application user accounts are able to inject own malicious script
codes to the vulnerable input fields to compromise the `Users - Settings - Configure SSO` settings module item listing. At the end an attacker is able to save the
information as executable content within the backend. After that the malicious context is saved to the SSO configuration module which executes the context.
The input fields are not parsed, the context does not encode the input with a secure mechanism. The injection points are the marked input fields with the request
method of the vulnerable modules. The execution points are located in the item listing of the separate sections.
A filter restriction is implemented and is trying to secure the validation. The filter mechanism parses iframes with src source and other script code tags. In case
of a mouseover onload link to a source or an img src onload with cookie alert the tags can bypass the filter validation procedure somehow and an execution of the
context occurs.
The security risk of the peristent web vulnerabilities and filter bypass issue are estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.5.
Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities and filter bypass issue requires a low privileged web application user account and low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects, persistent load of malicious script
codes or persistent web module context manipulation.

=======================
The web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged or restricted appliance application user account with low or
medium user interaction. For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the appliance web-application firewall of sonicwall and login as restricted user or lower privileged user account
2. Surf to the Users module
3. Click to Settings and open the "SSO Configure" button
4. Open one of the vulnerable modules
Note: Users > Settings > Configure SSO > SSO Agents; > Terminal Services Agent Settings or > RADIUS Accounting Single-Sign-On
5. Inject a script code payload to the Host Name/IP Address(es), Client Name/IP Address & Proxy Forward To input fields
Note: Regular frames are filtered but img or iframes with alert onload or onmouseover tag do bypass the filter validation
6. Save the entry and the payload directly executes in the utm firewall web user interface
7. Successful reproduce of the application-side input validation vulnerability and filter bypass issue!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a parse and encode of the vulnerable `Host Name / IP Address`, `Client Name/IP Address` and
`Proxy Forward To` input fields. Encode the following values `ldapServerBindName - usrTreesSel - ldapUsrsTree\_1` and `svcObjId`
to prevent an inject via POST method. Restrict the input fields and disallow the usage of special chars. Encode in the last step
the output listing locations in the `SSO Agents `,`Terminal Services Agent Settings` and `RADIUS Accounting Single-Sign-On`
modules to prevent the execution points of the vulnerabilities. Adjust the filter procedure and setup a more seure
exception-handling to interact during an invalid execution or unhandled exception.
Note: All the security issues are marked as resolved by dell sonicwall with several updates until 2017 Q4.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side input validation web vulnerability and the filter bypass issue are estimated as medium. (CVSS 4.5)
