Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5061:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of `EmfPlusDrawBeziers` records within EMF files.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing `EmfPlusDrawBeziers` records. This inadequate validation allows for a read operation to occur beyond the bounds of an allocated memory structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the application attempts to read data from a memory location that it should not be accessing, specifically past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is information disclosure. An attacker can read sensitive data from memory that would otherwise be inaccessible.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory states that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:**  User interaction is required, as the target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file that contains a crafted EMF file with a malformed `EmfPlusDrawBeziers` record.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious EMF file with a specially crafted `EmfPlusDrawBeziers` record to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
*   The attacker also needs to entice the victim to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page hosting the malicious EMF.
