Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper access control that allowed unauthorized users to execute queries. This means that the application did not sufficiently restrict which users were able to perform database operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insufficient Access Control:** The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly restrict access to database query execution. This allowed unauthorized users to interact directly with the database.
- **Query Execution Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is specifically related to the ability of unauthorized users to execute queries, implying a lack of validation or authorization checks before queries were processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Modification:** Unauthorized users could execute queries to alter entries in the database. This could lead to data corruption, unauthorized data modification, or other malicious actions impacting the integrity and confidentiality of the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthorized Query Execution:** Attackers could exploit the lack of authorization to send and execute malicious database queries. This indicates a vulnerability related to how the application handles or processes user-provided queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the application's interface or API to submit the crafted queries, but no specific authentication was required to perform the attack, which makes it critical
