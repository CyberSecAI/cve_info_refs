Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5357:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from ImageMagick's incorrect handling of certain malformed image files, specifically related to the DCM (DICOM) image format.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Memory leak: The provided Github issue report shows a memory leak occurring in the `ReadDCMImage` function within the `dcm.c` file. This indicates a failure to properly release allocated memory when processing a specific DICOM image.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): By tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker can trigger the memory leak, potentially causing the program to crash due to memory exhaustion.
- Possible Code Execution: While the primary impact described is a DoS, the Ubuntu Security Notice also mentions the possibility of code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

**Attack vectors:**

- Malicious image file: The attack vector involves providing a crafted image file, in this case a DICOM image, that exploits a flaw in how ImageMagick handles the format.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted image file to a system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick. This could be done via various means such as:
    - Tricking a user into opening the file.
    - Exploiting a vulnerable application that utilizes ImageMagick to process user-supplied images.

**Additional details:**

- The Github issue provides a specific example of the memory leak and a `poc.zip` file containing a sample malicious image file.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3681-1) confirms the vulnerability, stating that ImageMagick incorrectly handles certain malformed images, and provides updated package versions for several Ubuntu releases. It also lists CVE-2018-5357 among other related CVEs fixed in the update.
