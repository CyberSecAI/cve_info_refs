Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Linux kernel was logging the virtual addresses assigned to per-CPU data via a `printk` call. Specifically, the `pcpu_embed_first_chunk` function in `mm/percpu.c` was responsible for this logging.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The kernel logging of virtual addresses constituted an information leak. These addresses could be used to bypass ASLR, which could aid in exploiting other vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Facilitates Further Exploitation:** By revealing kernel addresses, this vulnerability made it easier for attackers to exploit other existing vulnerabilities. The address information could be used to predict memory locations, circumventing security measures like ASLR.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local attacker with the ability to read kernel logs (`dmesg`) could retrieve the virtual addresses.
*   **Kernel Log Analysis:** The attacker would grep the `dmesg` output for lines containing "pages/cpu" to extract the leaked addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to read the output of the `dmesg` command.

**Summary of Technical Details**

* The vulnerability resides within the `pcpu_embed_first_chunk` function in the `mm/percpu.c` file.
* The vulnerable code uses `pr_info` to output per-CPU memory allocations: `pr_info("PERCPU: Embedded %zu pages/cpu @%p s%zu r%zu d%zu u%zu\n", PFN_DOWN(size_sum), base, ai->static_size, ai->reserved_size, ai->dyn_size, ai->unit_size);`.
*  The  `%p` format specifier prints the `base` virtual address which is the vulnerability.
* Attackers can use `dmesg | grep "pages/cpu"` to retrieve these addresses.
*  The issue affects Linux kernel versions >= v2.6.32-rc1 up to and including 4.14.14.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by ADLab of VenusTech.
*   This vulnerability is often listed alongside other kernel vulnerabilities as part of larger security updates (e.g. DLA 1799-1, DSA-4497-1)
