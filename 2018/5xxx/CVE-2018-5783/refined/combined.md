Error message: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'   what():  vector::reserve Aborted  The problem happens since in line 499 of src/base/PdfVecObjects.h, the "size" variable could by manipulated by POC, which results in huge amount of memory allocation.   (gdb) l 494	// ----------------------------------------------------- 495	//  496	// ----------------------------------------------------- 497	inline void PdfVecObjects::Reserve( size_t size ) 498	{ 499	    m_vector.reserve( size ); 500	} 501	 502	// ----------------------------------------------------- 503	//  (gdb) p size $1 = 18446744073709551608   To reproduce the issue, run: podofoimgextract $POC OUTPUT The POC is attached.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1536179#c1)  Troy Dawson    2024-07-09 02:16:22 UTC  ``` EPEL 7 entered end-of-life (EOL) status on 2024-06-30.\n\nEPEL 7 is no longer maintained, which means that it\nwill not receive any further security or bug fix updates.\n As a result we are closing this bug.   ``` |  |
