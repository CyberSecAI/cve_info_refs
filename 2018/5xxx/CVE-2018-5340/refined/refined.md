Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to execute database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Query type restriction bypass:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass query type restrictions, enabling them to execute arbitrary database queries.
- **Insufficient access control:** The system fails to properly restrict access to database query execution, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Modification:** Attackers can alter database entries. This could include changing critical configurations, modifying user data, or potentially disrupting the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered by unauthorized users executing crafted database queries. The exact mechanism for achieving this execution isn't fully specified, but it involves bypassing intended query restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthorised access:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system that allows them to submit database queries, even if they are not supposed to have such privileges. This suggests the vulnerability might be present in a user-facing interface or API endpoint, not accessible to the general public.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed on April 24, 2018.
- The document explicitly mentions the vulnerability allows “unauthorized users to execute queries to alter database entries.” This indicates that the exploit does not require administrative privileges.
- The vulnerability is linked to CVE-2018-5340 and CVE-2018-5339.
