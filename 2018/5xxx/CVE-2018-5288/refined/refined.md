The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the "gd-rating-system" WordPress plugin. It describes both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Root Cause:**  Inadequate sanitization of the `panel` parameter in several admin pages of the plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `panel` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `panel` parameter is used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a crafted URL.

**LFI Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized input in the `panel` parameter is used within an include statement.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin directly uses the `panel` parameter in an `include` statement without sanitization or validation, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A crafted URL containing directory traversal sequences within the `panel` parameter, followed by the path to a file, is used to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the web server to exploit the vulnerability. This could be an authenticated administrator or unauthenticated attacker if the vulnerability is accessible without authentication.

The specific vulnerable files are located in the `/forms/` directory and are included dynamically using the `$_panel` variable from the request. The following are the vulnerable files with examples:
*   `information.php`
*   `about.php`
*   `transfer.php`
*   `tools.php`

The code snippet `include(GDRTS_PATH.'forms/panels/'.$_panel.'.php');` is the core of the LFI vulnerability, where `$_panel` is taken directly from the request without any sanitization and used in a file inclusion.

The content also notes that these vulnerabilities were tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the gd-rating-system plugin at the time of reporting.
