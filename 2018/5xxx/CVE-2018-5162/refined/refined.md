  "CVE-2018-5162": {
    "description": "Plaintext of decrypted emails can leak through the src attribute of remote images or links.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Thunderbird handles HTML emails, specifically when decrypting S/MIME or PGP encrypted content within a multipart email. The decrypted content can be exposed through the `src` attribute of an HTML tag such as `<img>` or `<iframe>` if the attribute is not properly closed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Plaintext leakage via HTML `src` attribute",
      "Improper handling of MIME parts leading to potential information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exfiltrate the plaintext of encrypted emails by crafting a malicious email that, upon decryption, includes an HTML element with a `src` attribute that includes the decrypted email content. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted multipart/mixed emails with a specific structure are sent to the victim.",
      "The email contains an HTML body part with an unclosed `src` attribute, followed by the encrypted email content, and then another HTML part to close the `src` attribute."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft an email with specific multipart structure. Furthermore, the attacker needs to have access to the encrypted email content, or can eavesdrop on the network traffic, compromisse email accounts, email servers, backup systems, or client computers.",
    "notes": "The vulnerability exists in how Thunderbird renders HTML, specifically with regards to how it processes MIME multipart messages. This allows an attacker to create an email that, upon decryption, will send the plaintext to a server of their choosing via the `src` attribute of an image tag. The fix involves ensuring that the src attribute is properly terminated before the end of a given HTML part."
