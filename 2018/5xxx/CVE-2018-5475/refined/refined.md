- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the D60 Line Distance Relay.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist, allowing for potential remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access, no authentication required.
