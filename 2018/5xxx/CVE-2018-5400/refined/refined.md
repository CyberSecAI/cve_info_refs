Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-5400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Auto-Maskin products utilize an undocumented custom protocol to set up Modbus communications with other devices, but they do not validate the authenticity or origin of these devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Origin Validation Error (CWE-346):** The software fails to properly verify the source of data or communication, making it susceptible to accepting malicious Modbus communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send arbitrary Modbus (control) information to the engine control units, potentially leading to unauthorized control and manipulation of the connected engines.
- An attacker can also observe information about configurations, settings, what sensors are present and in use, and other information by sending requests using the custom protocol.
- Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to gain read/write access and have an impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- An attacker can send malicious Modbus communications through the custom protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the affected devices via the network. No special privileges or authentication are explicitly required to exploit this vulnerability, due to the lack of origin validation.
- The required skill level is considered low.
