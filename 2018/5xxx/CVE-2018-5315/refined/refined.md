{
  "CVE-2018-5315": {
    "Description": "The Wachipi WP Events Calendar plugin 1.0 for WordPress has SQL Injection via the event_id parameter to event.php.",
    "Root cause": "The plugin does not sanitize the `event_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or even code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `event_id` parameter in the `event.php` file, making it accessible to remote attackers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious SQL injection payload in the `event_id` parameter. No authentication or special privileges are required."
