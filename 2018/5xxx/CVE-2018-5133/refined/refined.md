Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `app.support.baseURL` preference value is not properly sanitized before being used. This preference is intended to store a base URL for support information. However, if a malicious actor modifies this preference to include HTML and script content, this malicious content can be executed by the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Because the unsanitized `app.support.baseURL` is used in the context of generating a notification message, any HTML or JavaScript code within this preference gets interpreted and executed by the browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of input sanitization for the `app.support.baseURL` preference. The browser doesn't validate or remove potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript code before using this preference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The most significant impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Firefox browser. Because the code executes with the browser's permissions, it can lead to a variety of malicious activities.
- **Malware Persistence:** A local attacker could modify the `prefs.js` file (where `app.support.baseURL` is stored), injecting malicious content that will be executed every time the user encounters a trigger point. This could allow for persistent malware installation.
- **Ransomware:** The provided information specifically mentions the possibility of implementing ransomware as one type of malicious activity leveraging this vulnerability because the Javascript context can access Standard Javascript code modules such as OS.File module.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly mentioned, XSS vulnerabilities can also be used to steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Application:** A malicious local application or script can modify the `app.support.baseURL` preference in `prefs.js`.
- **User Profile Modification:** Direct modification of the `prefs.js` file by an attacker with local file system access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the user's Firefox profile directory or modify the user's preferences via a local application, script, or direct file access.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not necessarily need elevated privileges, as modifying preference files can be achieved with low privileges.
- **User Interaction (indirect):** The user needs to trigger the execution of the malicious payload, either by:
    - Accessing the preferences page via chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul and performing a search that yields no results.
    - Triggering the display of a CDM disabled message, which is triggered whenever the user tries to play DRM content and the CDM plugin is disabled. This can be achieved by visiting a site offering DRM content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the value of `app.support.baseURL` before using it in the generation of HTML content.
- The provided Bugzilla entry ([Bug 1430974](/show_bug.cgi?id=1430974)) includes a patch that replaces the use of `innerHTML` with DOM manipulation to prevent the XSS attack. It also validates that the URL scheme is `https`.
- The same Bugzilla entry shows that the fix was targeted for Firefox 59.
- The bug was classified as "sec-moderate", which aligns with the impact being limited to local attackers.
- The bug report mentions that similar vulnerability exists ([Bug 1430511](/show_bug.cgi?id=1430511)) in `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/findInPage.js` which was fixed in the same release.
