The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the "booking-calendar" WordPress plugin, version 1.8.4.  It details Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Insufficient input sanitization when saving settings related to "Extras," "Themes," and "Forms". User-supplied data is not properly filtered, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection on the plugin's settings update endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   In the "Extras" section, the `extra_field1[items][field_item1][price_percent]` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   In the "Themes" section, the `sale_conditions[count][]` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   In the "Forms" section, the `form_field5[label]` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **CSRF:**  The plugin doesn't implement CSRF tokens, making it possible to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin's settings.
    *   When other users, including administrators, access pages related to these settings, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.
    *   This allows an attacker to steal user cookies, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the victim user.
*   **CSRF:**
    *   An attacker can craft malicious HTML pages that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, can trigger unauthorized changes to the plugin's settings, including injecting malicious javascript payloads via the XSS vulnerabilities

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   An attacker with low-level access (e.g., an "editor" user role) to the WordPress admin panel can manipulate the vulnerable settings.
    *   The XSS payload is stored in the database.
    *   When another user views pages using the settings, the XSS payload is executed.
*   **CSRF:**
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint of the plugin.
    *   The attacker then tricks a logged-in user, typically an administrator, into visiting this malicious page.
    *   The victim's browser automatically sends the request to the server, triggering the malicious action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to have a low-privilege account with access to the WordPress admin panel with the ability to edit the plugin settings or to manipulate user supplied data stored by the vulnerable plugin,
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user, especially an administrator, to visit a webpage under the attackers control.
