Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Auto-Maskin devices transmit process control information via unencrypted Modbus communications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** The vulnerability lies in the use of unencrypted Modbus protocol for transmitting process control data, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can observe information about configurations, settings, and the sensors in use.
*   An attacker can send arbitrary Modbus (control) information to the engine control units, potentially leading to unauthorized control of the connected engines.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attacks. An attacker can intercept the unencrypted Modbus traffic if they are on the same network or can intercept traffic routed over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the devices or be able to intercept network traffic. This could be on the same local network as the device, or potentially through network traffic routing/interception if the device is exposed to the internet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected devices are Auto-Maskin RP210E Remote Panels and DCU210E Control Units.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions 3.7 and prior.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated for this specific vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low skill level to exploit.

This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities affecting these devices, including hardcoded credentials, origin validation errors, and other cleartext transmission issues.
