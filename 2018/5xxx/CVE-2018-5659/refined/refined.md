Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and CSRF protection in the "responsive-coming-soon-page" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several input parameters within the plugin's settings page are vulnerable to stored XSS. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when these settings are displayed.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions, such as modifying the plugin settings and injecting XSS payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **CSRF:** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can modify plugin settings by tricking a logged-in administrator. The attacker can combine this vulnerability with the stored XSS vulnerability to achieve a more severe impact, such as taking over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker crafts malicious input within the vulnerable parameters in the settings page such as `coming-soon_title`, `coming-soon_sub_title`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`, `bg_color`, `button_text_link`, `social_icon_1`, `counter_title_icon`, and `counter_title`.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker creates a malicious HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the plugin settings page. This page can be hosted on an attacker-controlled domain. When a logged-in admin user visits this page, the malicious form is submitted, modifying the plugin settings with the attacker's payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin settings page, typically requiring administrator-level privileges.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site. Instead they need to trick an administrator into visiting a webpage they control while the administrator has an active session on the vulnerable site.

**Technical Details:**
The provided text includes specific examples of vulnerable parameters and a CSRF Proof-of-Concept (POC) HTML code. These examples demonstrate how the attacker can inject JavaScript code into the plugin settings and how the CSRF attack can be executed.

**Additional Notes:**
The report mentions that the vulnerabilities were tested in WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the "responsive-coming-soon-page" plugin at the time of the report.
