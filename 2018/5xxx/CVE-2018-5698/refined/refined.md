- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists within the ReadStat library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow leading to a read out-of-bounds. Specifically, the AddressSanitizer output shows a read of 19 bytes at address 0x6030000000b2, which is 0 bytes to the right of an 18-byte region, which is outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output and the program aborting. It is also potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted `.dta` file (provided in the issue as <https://github.com/xcainiao/poc/blob/master/readstat_heap-buffer-overflow.dta>) with the `readstat` utility.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious `.dta` file to be processed by the vulnerable `readstat` utility, which requires the ability to provide the file to the application. The attacker also needs to have the vulnerable version of `readstat`.
