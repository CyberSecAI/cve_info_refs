  "summary": "Foxit Reader and Foxit PhantomPDF are vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing embedded U3D images inside of PDF files. This vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker by enticing a user to open a malicious PDF, leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer when parsing embedded U3D images inside of PDF files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient data validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on a vulnerable system.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "malicious_pdf": "An attacker can craft a malicious PDF document containing a specially crafted U3D image to trigger the overflow.",
      "user_interaction": "User interaction is required as the user must open the malicious PDF."
    },
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF with a specific U3D image to trigger the overflow.",
    "notes": "The provided advisory mentions CVE-2018-5676, but no details about the CVE were in the initial source. This is an issue with the Foxit Reader software. There is no mention of any specific vulnerable component, although the '3D Plugin Beta' is mentioned in other advisories. The vulnerability is triggered while parsing U3D images within a PDF."
