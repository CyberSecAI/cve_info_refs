Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2018-5996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper exception handling within 7-Zip's RAR3 handler, specifically in the `NCompress::NRar3::CDecoder::Code` method. A `CInBufferException` can occur during input stream reading, which can leave the PPMd model in an inconsistent or broken state, but the exception is not properly handled and the decoder reuses the broken model state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Exception Handling:** The `CDecoder::Code` method catches exceptions but does not prevent the reuse of a corrupted PPMd model state.
*   **PPMd Model Corruption:**  Due to the improper exception handling, the PPMd model can be corrupted, specifically by adding duplicate symbols to the `Stats` array of a context.
*   **Out-of-bounds access:** The `Ppmd7_DecodeSymbol` function doesn't check bounds when filling the `ps` buffer on the stack, and it can overflow the `ps` buffer if the `Stats` array has duplicate symbols. Additionally, the `UpdateModel` function doesn't have checks when accessing the `Stats` array, allowing for an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerabilities lead to both stack and heap buffer overflows.
    *   The stack overflow can occur in `Ppmd7_DecodeSymbol`, by adding duplicate symbols which leads to writing out of bounds of the `ps` buffer
    *   The heap overflow can occur in `UpdateModel` due to out of bounds access of the `Stats` array.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because of the memory corruption, especially with the lack of ASLR, DEP and stack canaries in 7-Zip binaries, the vulnerability can be exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RAR Archive:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted RAR archive.
*   **PPMd and RAR3:** The vulnerability is specific to RAR3 archives using the PPMd compression method within 7-Zip.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious RAR archive that triggers the exception at the right moment during PPMd processing and also manipulates the data to further cause the stack/heap overflows.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The user would need to open the malicious RAR file with a vulnerable version of 7-Zip.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a first item in the RAR archive that throws an exception during PPMd model update, then a second item will cause the corrupted state to be used.
* The vulnerability exists in 7-Zip versions prior to 18.00.
* The 0patch blog provides specific code snippets and disassembly analysis that shows the vulnerability and micropatches.
* The affected 7-Zip binaries are often compiled without `/NXCOMPAT` or `/DYNAMICBASE` flags, making exploitation easier.
