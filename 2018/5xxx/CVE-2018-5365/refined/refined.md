{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WPGlobus plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters when updating plugin options, and also lacks CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of input parameters.",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing CSRF protection mechanisms (nonce)."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser session by injecting malicious payloads into the plugin settings. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the admin user, or inject malicious content into the website. Combined with the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can trick an admin user into submitting a form with malicious values, without the user's knowledge.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By submitting a crafted POST request with malicious JavaScript payloads in the 'wpglobus_option' parameters to the 'wp-admin/options.php' endpoint.",
    "By tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious webpage which submits a CSRF attack via form with the malicious payload.",
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and host a malicious web page that an administrator might visit. They do not need to be authenticated to the target WordPress instance but would need to know the targeted WordPress' install URL."
