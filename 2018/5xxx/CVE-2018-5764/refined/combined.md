# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

                 CVE-2018-5764

```
Trail of Bits used the automated vulnerability discovery tools developed
for the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge to audit zlib. As rsync, a fast,
versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool, uses an embedded copy of
zlib, those issues are also present in rsync.
```

CVE-2016-9840
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, remove offset pointer
     optimization, as this is not compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9841
     Only use post-increment to be compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9842
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, do not shift negative values,
     as this is not compliant with the C standard.

CVE-2016-9843
     In order to avoid undefined behavior, do not pre-decrement a pointer
     in big-endian CRC calculation, as this is not compliant with the
     C standard.

CVE-2018-5764
     Prevent remote attackers from being able to bypass the
     argument-sanitization protection mechanism by ignoring --protect-args
     when already sent by client.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.1.1-3+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your rsync packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
