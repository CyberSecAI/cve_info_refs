{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "WebExtensions can bypass host permission using request redirection and filterReponseData API.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "WebExtensions with the webRequest and webRequestBlocking permissions can redirect network requests to arbitrary hosts using the filterReponseData API.",
      "The filterResponseData stream is not disconnected upon a redirect, allowing extensions to receive data from a redirected channel for which it does not have explicit host permission."
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious WebExtension that bypasses host permissions to access content from arbitrary hosts for which the extension does not have explicit user permission, including sensitive user information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious WebExtension can be crafted to leverage the webRequest API and filterResponseData.",
        "The extension must have the webRequest and webRequestBlocking permissions.",
        "The attacker must trick a user into installing the malicious extension."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious web extension and trick a user into installing it. The extension only needs the `webRequest` and `webRequestBlocking` permissions.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs because `StreamFilter` is not disconnected upon a redirect. The fix for this vulnerability is tracked under [bug 1444539](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1444539)."
