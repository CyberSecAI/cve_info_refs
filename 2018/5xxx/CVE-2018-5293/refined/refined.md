  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses unsanitized user-supplied input in the 'panel' parameter, leading to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'panel' parameter.",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the use of an unsanitized 'panel' parameter in an include statement."

    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser (XSS) or include arbitrary files from the webserver file system (LFI), potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or complete server compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "XSS": "By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the 'panel' parameter, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page when a user visits the crafted link.",
      "LFI": "By crafting a malicious URL with a path traversal sequence in the 'panel' parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the web server file system."
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and have a victim user click on the crafted URL (for XSS), or have the ability to browse the vulnerable application with the crafted URL (for LFI). An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities from a remote position."
