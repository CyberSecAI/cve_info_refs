## Relevant Content from analyzed sources regarding CVE-2018-5391:

### Root Cause of Vulnerability
*   The IP implementation in the Linux kernel performs algorithmically expensive operations when handling incoming packet fragments.
*   The vulnerability became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size.
*   The vulnerability is due to how the Linux kernel handles reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted IP fragments that trigger algorithmically expensive operations.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present
*   Algorithmically expensive operations in the TCP/IP implementation
*   Improper input validation, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption
*   Vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attack with low rates of specially crafted packets.

### Impact of Exploitation
*   A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the system.
*   The DoS condition may involve CPU saturation.

### Attack Vectors
*   A remote attacker sends specially crafted IP fragments.
*   The attacker can send a low rate of packets to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attack is triggered when the kernel attempts to reassemble IP fragments.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position
*   The attacker requires the ability to send network packets to the target system.
*   No authentication is required.

### Additional Details
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions 3.9+.
*  The vulnerability is also known as "FragmentSmack".
*   The vulnerability became exploitable due to increased size of the IP fragment reassembly queue.

**Summary of Extracted Information**
*   **Root Cause**: The vulnerability exists because the Linux kernel performs algorithmically expensive operations while handling specially crafted, fragmented IP packets, particularly during reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The increase in the reassembly queue size made this vulnerability exploitable.
*   **Vulnerability**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation when reassembling fragmented IP packets which leads to uncontrolled resource consumption by the kernel.
*   **Impact**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition, potentially saturating the CPU.
*   **Attack Vector**: The attack vector is remote, with specially crafted IP fragments sent over the network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker requires the ability to send specially crafted IP packets to the target system, but no authentication is needed.
*   **Additional Details**: The vulnerability affects Linux kernels 3.9+, is known as FragmentSmack, and has become exploitable due to the increased reassembly queue size.

**Mitigations (From the analyzed data):**
*   **Reduce queue size**: The default values of `net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh`, `net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh`, `net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh`, and `net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh` should be reduced back to 256kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below.
*   **Revert Commit:** A sufficient mitigation is to revert the commit c2a936600f78aea00d3312ea4b66a79a4619f9b4.
*   **SystemTap Script:** A systemtap script can be used to lower the soft and hard limits on each execution of network applications. The provided script attempts to modify the thread's rlimit-in-effect around calls to the vulnerable `get_arg_page()` function to encompass the newly required maximum limit of `_STK_LIM / 4 * 3`. Additionally the script intercepts `setrlimit()` calls to enforce the limit.
