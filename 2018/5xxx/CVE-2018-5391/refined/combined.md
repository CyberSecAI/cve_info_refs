## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3741-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# CVE-2018-5391

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-5390.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-5407.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-5391 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5391)

#### Description

The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-31 20:03:19 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels with commit b6a2fea39318 ("mm: variable length argument support", from July 19, 2007) but without commit da029c11e6b1 ("exec:Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM", from July 7, 2017). An integer overflow in the Linux kernel's create_elf_tables() function. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a SUID-root binary and obtain full root privileges.   Referenced commits: b6a2fea39318 ("mm: variable length argument support", from July 19, 2007) <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba>  da029c11e6b1 ("exec: Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM", from July 7, 2017)  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/da029c11e6b12f321f36dac8771e833b65cec962>  Additional references: <https://www.qualys.com/2018/09/25/cve-2018-14634/mutagen-astronomy-integer-overflow-linux-create_elf_tables-cve-2018-14634.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-09-03 15:05:58 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c9)  Petr Matousek    2018-09-25 15:24:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect 32-bit systems as they do not have a large enough address space to exploit this flaw.  Systems with less than 32GB of memory are very unlikely to be affected by this issue due to memory demands during exploitation.  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue affects the version of the kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 will address this issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c10)  Petr Matousek    2018-09-25 15:27:52 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate the issue:  Enable and install kernel-debuginfo packages as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/666123>  1) On the host, save the following in a file with the ".stp" extension:  // [CVE-2018-14634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-14634) // // Theory of operations: adjust the thread's # rlimit-in-effect around // calls to the vulnerable get_arg_page() function so as to encompass // the newly required _STK_LIM / 4 * 3 maximum.  // Complication: the rlimit is stored in a current-> structure that // is shared across the threads of the process.  They may concurrently // invoke this operation.  function clamp_stack_rlim_cur:long () %{   struct rlimit *rlim = current->signal->rlim;   unsigned long rlim_cur = READ_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur);    unsigned long limit = _STK_LIM / 4 * 3;   limit *= 4; // multiply it back up, to the scale used by rlim_cur    if (rlim_cur > limit) {     WRITE_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur, limit);     STAP_RETURN(limit);   } else     STAP_RETURN(0); %}  probe kernel.function("copy_strings").call {   l = clamp_stack_rlim_cur()    if (l)      printf("lowered process %s(%d) STACK rlim_cur to %p\n",             execname(), pid(), l) }  probe begin { 	printf("CVE-2018-14634 mitigation loaded\n")  }  probe end { 	printf("CVE-2018-14634 mitigation unloaded\n") }  2) Install the "systemtap" package and any required dependencies. Refer to the "2. Using SystemTap" chapter in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux "SystemTap Beginners Guide" document, available from docs.redhat.com, for information on installing the required -debuginfo and matching kernel-devel packages  3) Run the "stap -g [filename-from-step-1].stp" command as root.  If the host is rebooted, the changes will be lost and the script must be run again.   Alternatively, build the systemtap script on a development system with "stap -g -p 4 [filename-from-step-1].stp", distribute the resulting kernel module to all affected systems, and run "staprun -L <module>" on those. When using this approach only systemtap-runtime package is required on the affected systems. Please notice that the kernel version must be the same across all systems.   This may not be a suitable workaround if your application uses massive amounts of stack space. Please consider this if there are any adverse affects when running this mitigation.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-25 19:06:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2748 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2748](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2748)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-25 19:07:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2763 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2763](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2763)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c14)  Alexander Peslyak    2018-09-26 12:05:43 UTC  ``` Petr, am I correct that the systemtap mitigation is racy, and can be bypassed by a more elaborate exploit that would reset rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur back to a high enough value from another thread of the invoking process (perhaps it'd be doing that in a busy loop)? This came up in discussions of a similar kernel patch, resulting in patches to the patch, last year. I wonder if we can come up with a simple yet non-racy systemtap mitigation. Maybe also trap setrlimit() and impose a higher limit there that's enough to prevent the attack yet unlikely to break desirable uses.  Also, I'm curious - why exactly is RHEL5 unaffected? Thanks!   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c15)  Kent Engström    2018-09-26 17:06:29 UTC  ``` Trying the SystemTap mitigation script in our EL6 x86_64 environment, it seems to set the stack limit at shown by "ulimit -s" to 30720 regardless of the initial setting in /etc/security/limits.conf where we have "unlimited".  Setting a big number instead of unlimited in /etc/security/limits.conf for stack does not seem to matter; still set to 30720 by the SystemTap script.  Before applying:  # ssh n1 ulimit -s unlimited  # ssh n1 staprun -L CVE-2018-14634-mitigation/2.6.32-754.3.5.el6.x86_64/stap_4d64dccb8f09ef10871f7b00522c1ff7_3076.ko  # ssh n1 ulimit -s 30720  Is it supposed to be like this?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c16)  Alexander Peslyak    2018-09-26 19:34:38 UTC  ``` I can't speak about the intent, but the behavior Kent describes is consistent with my reading of the SystemTap mitigation script. The specific number 30720 is a result of what I think is a bug-turned-feature, in "limit *= 4; // multiply it back up, to the scale used by rlim_cur". This doesn't make sense to me in its current context (I guess this line is a leftover from prior edits of the script), but the multiplication results in the limit being not so low (would have been 3/4 of the default 10 MiB stack limit otherwise, which is more likely to break some applications and is unnecessarily strict to prevent exploitation of this specific issue). I think a forced limit of 30 MiB is sane, unless you have specific applications that require a higher limit (in which case you can edit the SystemTap script accordingly - a limit of a few hundred MiB would still mitigate the original issue).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c18)  Wade Mealing    2018-09-27 00:35:34 UTC  ``` This will not modifiy the live limit shown by ulimit command.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c20)  Wade Mealing    2018-09-27 02:40:09 UTC  ``` Gday Alexander,  I take responsibility for the systemtap script, Petr just made it public.    > am I correct that the systemtap mitigation is racy, and can be bypassed by a more elaborate exploit that would reset rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur back to a high enough value from another thread of the invoking process (perhaps it'd be doing that in a busy loop)?   You seem to be correct, I was not part of this discussion.  I had assumed that copy_strings would be the correct time, but much like most situations it is never as simple as it seems.   > This came up in discussions of a similar kernel patch, resulting in patches to > the patch, last year. I wonder if we can come up with a simple yet non-racy  > systemtap mitigation.  I had a few different angles, both of which appear to suffer the same race condition flaw that you've pointed out here.  I was pondering if it would be better to apply it directly to get_arg_page, but I think that will require additional investigation.    Feedback welcome on your behalf.  I think that working on this may have diminishing returns as the errata has already started shipping.   I had a reproducer that worked on el6 and el7, it did not reproduce on el5, but now you have me concerned I'm going to test it again.  Will post back with results.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c21)  Alexander Peslyak    2018-09-27 12:02:12 UTC  ``` Thanks, Wade.  I don't understand what you mean by "This will not modifiy the live limit shown by ulimit command." If you're referring to the effect of the SystemTap mitigation, then it's actually expected to modify that, visibly I think due to bash calling getrlimit(), and it's been reported that way in a comment above.  In last year's discussions (and in the grsecurity patch much earlier), the only reason for the rlimit to be lowered on exec was to apply that selectively to SUID/SGID exec, rather than to all execs. Since you're doing it for all execs anyway, a simple workaround and end-user can use is to lower the hard limit in /etc/security/limits.conf with a line like this:  * hard stack 30720  This will apply to user logins (e.g., via SSH), but unfortunately not to various privsep child processes of services, etc., unless and until those services are manually restarted by someone logged in as root. It might or might not apply to various non-login ways that a user can invoke a command - e.g., via .forward files - depending on whether those services start PAM sessions for those command invocations or not. Thus, a more complete fix would (also) include adding "ulimit -Hs 30720" to an early system bootup script from where all other service startup scripts are invoked, but do we still have anything like that with systemd? I'm not familiar with systemd.  And this brings us back to a possible SystemTap, where I think you could lower both the hard and the soft limit. There's no point in allowing a higher hard limit if you'd be resetting the soft limit on each exec anyway. Not to be racy against a concurrent setrlimit(), which might be past its hard limit check already, you'd need to also intercept setrlimit() calls (is there a compat version of that syscall? if so, that as well) and impose the limit on its inputs. OTOH, if someone doesn't mind rebooting with the SystemTap loaded early on at bootup, then the race wouldn't matter anymore once we're setting both the hard and the soft limit on each exec - the hard limit would get inherited by all child processes, thereby preventing a concurrent setrlimit() attack on the already booted up system.  Yes, "working on this may have diminishing returns as the errata has already started shipping." Maybe it's more important to prepare better instructions for setup of SystemTap-based mitigations for next time one is needed. How can one have a SystemTap-based mitigation re-applied on system bootup early on? A hack I once used on a RHEL6'ish system is this:  # tail -4 /etc/sysconfig/sshd MOD=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/dirtycow.ko if [ -e $MOD ]; then 	staprun -L $MOD fi  Perhaps Red Hat should start recommending something like this, or come up with an official way for SystemTap-based mitigations to be loaded on system bootup (e.g., have a "service" that would do that, and would be guaranteed to start up before things such as sshd, crond, MTAs, etc. - those that may invoke user-supplied programs as part of their normal functionality).  Regarding RHEL5, I know why our OpenVZ/RHEL5-based kernels on Owl are unaffected since we migrated to those back in 2010 - I lowered MAX_ARG_STRINGS and introduced an extra check into get_arg_pages() back then (no, this isn't in OpenVZ upstream, it's Owl-specific unfortunately) - but I was surprised to hear yours are unaffected either. Maybe there's something else preventing the attack on those kernels (good) or on the specific system you tested on (bad; e.g., 32 GB could somehow not be allocated in the kernel when total RAM isn't a lot higher than that).  Thanks again for your replies.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c25)  Yogendra Jog    2018-10-03 12:36:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/mutagen-astronomy> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/09/25/4>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c28)  Frank Ch.

# CVE-2018-5391

| **Name** | CVE-2018-5391 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size. |

## Details

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM RM1224 is a 4G ROUTER for wireless IP-communication from Ethernet based devices
via LTE(4G)- mobile radio, optimized for use in North America.

ROX-based VPN endpoints and ﬁrewall devices are used to connect devices that operate in harsh
environments such as electric utility substations and trafﬁc control cabinets.

The SCALANCE M-800 / S615 industrial routers are used for secure remote access to plants via mobile
networks, e.g. GPRS or UMTS with the integrated security functions of a ﬁrewall for protection against
unauthorized access and VPN to protect data transmission.

The SCALANCE SC-600 devices (SC622-2C, SC632-2C, SC636-2C, SC642-2C, SC646-2C) are used to
protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks. They allow ﬁltering incoming and outgoing
network connections in different ways.

SCALANCE W1700 products are wireless communication devices used to connect industrial components,
like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), according to the IEEE
802.11ac standard.

SCALANCE W700 products are wireless communication devices used to connect industrial components
like Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIMATIC RF185C, RF186C/CI, and RF188C/CI are communication modules for direct connection of
SIMATIC identiﬁcation systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet and OPC UA.

processors connects the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions
such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

SINEMA Remote Connect ensures management of secure connections (VPN) between headquarters,
service technicians and the installed machines or plants.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

# USN-3740-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

14 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3740-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1017-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.15.0-1017.18~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.15.0-1017.18~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-32-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-32-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-32.35~16.04.1)

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

识别并修复受此公告影响的系统。

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2925)

## 标题

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the kernel source code lacked support to report the Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) vulnerability status on IBM Power Systems. As a consequence, the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec\_store\_bypass file incorrectly reported "Not affected". This fix updates the kernel source code to properly report the SSBD status either as "Vulnerable" or "Mitigation: Kernel entry/exit barrier (TYPE)", where TYPE is one of "eieio", "hwsync", "fallback", or "unknown". (BZ#1615873)
* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625335)
* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629634)

## 解决方案

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Linux kernel IP fragment re-assembly vulnerable to denial of service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#641765

Original Release Date: 2018-08-14 | Last Revised: 2018-10-12

---

### Overview

The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, IP implementation is vulnerable to denial of service conditions with low rates of specially modified packets.

### Description

| [**CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) - CVE-2018-5391  The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to trigger a denial-of-service condition against the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Patches are available from OS vendors to address the vulnerability. |
| --- |

| If you are unable to apply a patch, see the following mitigations:**Modify Default Configurations**Change the (default) values of net.ipv4/ipv6.ipfrag\_high\_thresh and net.ipv4/ipv6.ipfrag\_low\_thresh back to 256kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below.Example:sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag\_low\_thresh=196608sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag\_high\_thresh=262144sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag\_low\_thresh=196608sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag\_high\_thresh=262144Update:Further testing shows that these mitigations are not a 100% fix. A significantly strong attack will still result in a denial of service condition. **Revert Commit**Another sufficient mitigation is to revert the commit c2a936600f78aea00d3312ea4b66a79a4619f9b4 |

### [Microsoft](#MOLR-B5GGKS) Affected

Notified:  August 13, 2018  Updated: October 12, 2018

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Microsoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability (named "FragmentSmack" CVE-2018-5391) affecting Windows systems. An attacker could send many 8-byte sized IP fragments with random starting offsets, but withhold the last fragment and exploit the worst-case complexity of linked lists in reassembling IP fragments. A system under attack would become unresponsive with 100% CPU utilization but would recover as soon as the attack terminated.

To protect your system from this vulnerability, Microsoft recommends that you take the following actions:
1) Register for security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security Notifications.
2) Test and apply security updates. See the Affected Products table to download and install the updates.
3) If you cannot apply the security updates immediately, you can apply the workaround described in FAQ #1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:26 UTC  ``` A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.  External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/641765>  A fix is a merge commit in the Linux kernel tree:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f>  consisting of the following commits:  7969e5c40dfd04799d4341f1b7cd266b6e47f227 385114dec8a49b5e5945e77ba7de6356106713f4 fa0f527358bd900ef92f925878ed6bfbd51305cc   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c13)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-08 10:09:14 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  One may change the default 4MB and 3MB values of net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh (and their ipv6 counterparts net.ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh) to 256 kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. Tests show some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware, configuration and environment.  There can be some impact on performance though, due to ipfrag_high_thresh of 262144 bytes, as only two 64K fragments can fit in the reassembly queue at the same time. For example, there is a risk of breaking applications that rely on large UDP packets.  See the Mitigation section in the <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061> article for the script to quickly change to/from default and lower settings.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c16)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 20:09:40 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1616059](show_bug.cgi?id=1616059 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14641 CVE-2018-5391 kernel: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c18)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 21:28:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9. Future kernel updates for the respective releases will address this issue.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but to a lesser degree. As such, the issue severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate. This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle and the issue severity. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c19)  Hal Murphy    2018-08-14 23:34:33 UTC  ``` I think the proposed new values in script at bottom of <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061> are flipped: low_thresh is lower than high_thresh:      sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=262144     sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=196608     sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=262144     sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=196608   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c20)  Hal Murphy    2018-08-14 23:36:16 UTC  ``` Typo: low_thresh is HIGHER than high_thresh   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c21)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-15 08:02:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Hal Murphy from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c20)) > Typo: low_thresh is HIGHER than high_thresh  Indee, this is wrong, thank you for noticing!

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3540)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

These updated kernel packages include also numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions in the related Knowledge Article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3684891>

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Sure, give me a day or two to get it out. I'll cross-post
LKML/ksummit-discuss/oss-security as I think it's one of those times it
actually makes sense.

Whatever list admins/members are comfortable with.

Yes, this is tricky. Maybe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group"? Thats our
group name within Microsoft. I guess that we can also add a short wiki
page with references to the products/distros we support as well as a
clarification that this has nothing to do with Windows and list MSRC's
contact information.

As I've indicated before, we intend to follow the list's policies.
Information obtained from the list will be used only for the purposes
listed in our original application, and any additional future use will
go through the list for approvals first.

Subject: Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft

Hi all,

Per our current policy and precedents, I see no valid reasons not to
subscribe Microsoft (or part(s) of it, see below) to linux-distros.  So
I intend to figure out some detail and proceed with the subscription.

The only voiced reasons not to, such as in Georgi Guninski's posting and
in comments on some technology news sites that covered Microsoft's
request, are irrelevant per our currently specified membership criteria.

Besides, (at least to me) Microsoft doesn't look all that different from
many other large corporations, including some which already have their
Linux distro teams represented on the list.  Microsoft has a lasting
stigma from its past actions from long ago.  IMO, we shouldn't let that
result in a biased decision against current Microsoft, effectively
favoring other corporations who might not be any better currently, but
just don't have that established stigma.

The oldest of these is August 8, 2018, which is just 1 month short of
the 1 year term.  I suppose we could either give Microsoft this 1 month
off as you suggest based on Microsoft's track record of promptly dealing
with security issues in non-Linux products, or subscribe Microsoft to
linux-distros in August 2019 (or later).

More importantly, maybe we shouldn't list "Microsoft" as a member of
linux-distros.  Microsoft is so much more than the recent Linux-based
products and services.  We similarly list "Amazon Linux AMI" rather than
"Amazon", and "Chrome OS" rather than "Google" (and we had separately
listed "Android", which has since unsubscribed), and "Ubuntu" rather
than "Canonical".  OTOH, we were not as careful to list proper products,
etc. for some others such as "Oracle".

If we list "Microsoft", this might be especially confusing since issues
being reported might also be relevant to Windows.  The reporters need to
know they're not reaching Windows security team unless they specifically
authorize that.

Any suggestions on the above?

Regardless, the list policy only allows use of the information for
"getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and, only in rare
extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing changes to
maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most essential to the
distro users' security in face of the security issue being dealt with.
The need-to-know condition is met only if the person needs to
participate in one of these two activities."  This is meant to preclude
sharing within the organization beyond its parts responsible for the
"distro" the organization is subscribed for.

# RHSA-2018:2846 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2846)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

These updated kernel packages include also numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions in the related Knowledge Article:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3635371>

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2924)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625334)
* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629633)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:26 UTC  ``` A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.  External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/641765>  A fix is a merge commit in the Linux kernel tree:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f>  consisting of the following commits:  7969e5c40dfd04799d4341f1b7cd266b6e47f227 385114dec8a49b5e5945e77ba7de6356106713f4 fa0f527358bd900ef92f925878ed6bfbd51305cc   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c13)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-08 10:09:14 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  One may change the default 4MB and 3MB values of net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh (and their ipv6 counterparts net.ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh) to 256 kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. Tests show some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware, configuration and environment.  There can be some impact on performance though, due to ipfrag_high_thresh of 262144 bytes, as only two 64K fragments can fit in the reassembly queue at the same time. For example, there is a risk of breaking applications that rely on large UDP packets.  See the Mitigation section in the <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061> article for the script to quickly change to/from default and lower settings.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c16)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 20:09:40 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1616059](show_bug.cgi?id=1616059 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14641 CVE-2018-5391 kernel: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c18)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 21:28:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9. Future kernel updates for the respective releases will address this issue.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but to a lesser degree. As such, the issue severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate. This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle and the issue severity.

# USN-3742-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

14 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3742-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX timers

subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2017-18344](/security/CVE-2017-18344))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-155.206~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-155.206~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.155.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.155.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3459)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391.

Bug Fix(es):

These updated kernel packages include also numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions in the related Knowledge Article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3674801>

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

If a task was migrated to another CPU after a context switch, a mismatch between CPU and runqueue during load balancing sometimes occurred. Consequently, a runnable task on an idle CPU failed to run, and the operating system became unresponsive. This update disables preemption in the schedule\_tail() function. As a result, CPU migration during post-schedule processing no longer occurs, which prevents the above mismatch. The operating system no longer hangs due to this bug. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1617941](show_bug.cgi?id=1617941 "CLOSED ERRATA - RT system hang due to wrong of rq's nr_running [rhel-7.5.z]") [1618466](show_bug.cgi?id=1618466 "CLOSED ERRATA - RT system hang due to wrong of rq's nr_running [MRG-RT]")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1618466,1617941)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-10-30 09:43:34 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

There are also many process waiting for hold the boot_tvec_bases lock.

Can you describe in more detail,or paste the code?  That is not where preemption is getting enabled.  finish_task_switch() calls finish_lock_switch() which releases rq->lock, and releasing a raw spinlock contains a preempt_enable().  The fix is upstream commit 1a43a14a5bd9c32 ("sched: Fix schedule_tail() to disable preemption").  >   In addition, the preemption is also enabled in latest kernel code:  >  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/> > kernel/sched/core.c?h=v4.18-rc8  Yes, but not until after balance_callback() -- and upstream has made the preempt count always be 2 on context switch, whereas in 3.10 a newly forked thread has a preempt count of 1.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1608672#c15)  Beth Uptagrafft    2018-09-17 16:04:31 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1590222](show_bug.cgi?id=1590222) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1608672#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-30 09:43:34 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

CVE-2018-1002105: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/aks-clusters-patched-for-kubernetes-vulnerability/>

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1610958#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-01 17:15:30 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in kernel versions before 4.14.8. The timer_create syscall implementation in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 doesn't properly validate the sigevent->sigev_notify field, which leads to out-of-bounds access in the show_timer function (called when /proc/$PID/timers is read). This allows userspace applications to read arbitrary kernel memory (on a kernel built with CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS and CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE).  References:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q3/76>  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cef31d9af908243421258f1df35a4a644604efbe>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1610958#c4)  Wade Mealing    2018-08-08 05:54:28 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Attached to this bugzilla is a systemtap script that will prevent opening (and therefore reading) the /proc/<process>/timers file which is used to leak information.  The SystemTap script is relatively small and efficient, broken into 3 distinct sections as follows:  --------  probe kernel.function("proc_timers_open@fs/proc/base.c").return {          // this is -EACCES 	$return = -13;         message = sprintf("CVE-2017-18344 mitigation denied access to %s to %s(%d)", file_name , execname(), pid());         // print a warning message at KERN_INFO debug level         printk(6, message); }  probe begin {         printk(6, "Mitigation for [CVE-2017-18344](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-18344) loaded.\n"); }   probe end {         printk(6, "Mitigation for [CVE-2017-18344](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-18344) unloaded.\n"); }   ---------  First, the script places a probe at the return of the kernel function “proc_timers_open” when called.   This modifies the return value to be EACCES which would return this value to userspace preventing this file from being opened.  When the /proc/<pid>/timer file is attempted to be opened, a message will be logged to the kernel log subsystem showing the process and pid of the application attempting to access the timer file.    This file is not in widespread use at this time, although some applications may read from it to debug or understand their own timers that are set.  This mitigation will not be useful in this context.  Finally, the “probe begin” and “probe end” code blocks tell systemtap to add the supplied text to the kernel log buffer via the printk function. This creates an audit trail by registering in the system logs exactly when the mitigation is loaded and unloaded.  This will need to be compiled with guru mode (-g parameter) to compile.  This will need to be loaded at each boot to remain effective.  Red Hat Product security recommends updating to a patched kernel when it is available.  Red Hat always seeks to provide both mitigations to disable attacks as well as the actual patches to treat the flaw.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5391

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This is mitigated by reducing the default limits on memory usage
    for incomplete fragmented packets.  The same mitigation can be
    achieved without the need to reboot, by setting the sysctls:

    net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608

    The default values may still be increased by local configuration
    if necessary.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment
re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending
specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation
have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability
(CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of
the IP fragment reassembly queue size.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel
performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when
handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3590)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629565)
* Previously, a packet was missing the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) payload checksum during a full checksum computation, if the hardware checksum was not applied. As a consequence, a packet with an incorrect checksum was dropped by a peer. With this update, the kernel includes the UDP payload checksum during the full checksum computation. As a result, the checksum is computed correctly and the packet can be received by the peer. (BZ#1635792)
* Previously, a transform lookup through the xfrm framework could be performed on an already transformed destination cache entry (dst\_entry). When using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) over IPv6 with a connected socket in conjunction with Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) in Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) transport mode. As a consequence, invalid IPv6 fragments transmitted from the host or the kernel occasionally terminated unexpectedly due to a socket buffer (SKB) underrun. With this update, the xfrm lookup on an already transformed dst\_entry is not possible. As a result, using UDP iperf utility over IPv6 ESP no longer causes invalid IPv6 fragment transmissions or a kernel panic. (BZ#1639586)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# RHSA-2018:2791 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2791)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391.

Bug Fix(es):

* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625330)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.4 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1575065](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575065)
  - CVE-2018-10675 kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact
* [BZ - 1601704](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1601704)
  - CVE-2018-5390 kernel: TCP segments with random offsets allow a remote denial of service (SegmentSmack)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2933)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, invalid headers in the sk\_buff struct led to an indefinite loop in the tcp\_collapse() function. As a consequence, the system became unresponsive. This update backports the upstream changes that remove the problematic code in tcp\_collapse(). As a result, the system no longer hangs in the described scenario. (BZ#1619630)
* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625333)
* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629632)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

by David Miller): there are no legitimate use cases for overlapping
fragments;
\* changes IPv4 defrag queue from a list to a rb tree (suggested
by Eric Dumazet): this change removes a potential attach vector.
Upcoming patches will contain similar changes for IPv6 frag queue,
as well as a comprehensive IP defrag self-test (temporarily delayed).

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2785)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391.

Bug Fix(es):

* On systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, a node sometimes got into "NodeNotReady" state after a CPU softlockup. Consequently, the node was not available. This update fixes an irq latency source in memory compaction. As a result, nodes no longer get into "NodeNotReady" state under the described circumstances. (BZ#1596281)
* Previously, the kernel source code was missing support to report the Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) vulnerability status on IBM Power Systems and the little-endian variants of IBM Power Systems. As a consequence, the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec\_store\_bypass file incorrectly reported "Not affected" on both CPU architectures. This fix updates the kernel source code to properly report the SSBD status either as "Vulnerable" or "Mitigation: Kernel entry/exit barrier (TYPE)" where TYPE is one of "eieio", "hwsync", "fallback", or "unknown". (BZ#1612351)
* The hypervisors of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 virtual machines (VMs) in certain circumstances mishandled the microcode update in the kernel. As a consequence, the VMs sometimes became unresponsive when booting. This update applies an upstream patch to avoid early microcode update when running under a hypervisor. As a result, kernel hangs no longer occur in the described scenario. (BZ#1618388)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Overview

Two security flaws named SegmentSmack and FragmentSmack were recently found in the Linux kernel.

A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system with relatively small bandwidth of the incoming network traffic. In a worst case scenario, an attacker can stall an affected host or device with less than 2 kpps of an attack traffic. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

A result of the attack with 4 streams can look like a complete saturation of 4 CPU cores and delays in a network packets processing:

```

```

A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.

A result of the 30 kpps attack on the physical system with Intel(R) Xeon(R) D-1587@1.70GHz CPUs and 32 cores in total may look like a complete saturation of a core:

```
top - 08:59:45 up  1:34,  2 users,  load average: 0.39, 0.15, 0.08
%Cpu9  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,100.0 si,  0.0 st
  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND

```

An attack from a single IP host may saturate more than 1 CPU core by forging packets to be sent from different IP addresses. The Linux kernel uses complex algorithm to schedule such IP fragment reassembly among the CPU cores. So such reassembly could be distributed to the different CPU cores, but it is quite harder to achieve this compared to the SegmentSmack flaw. Such an attack from 2 forged IP addresses may look like a complete saturation of 2 cores, but it is harder for an attacker to achieve this:

```

```
## Affected Products

SegmentSmack and FragmentSmack attacks are possible due to the algorithms used in the Linux kernel network stack; all the Red Hat products with moderately new Linux kernel versions are affected.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Real Time
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for IBM Power9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for IBM SystemZ
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host
* Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
* Red Hat Virtualization 4

RHEL-5 is affected by these flaws by a significantly lesser degree. Namely, in our tests only a high-speed attack of 1Mpps (packets, not bytes or bits) was able to barely saturate 1 CPU core. As such, the flaws severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate.

## Resolution

### SegmentSmack

No effective workaround or mitigation besides a fixed kernel is known at this time.

### Mitigation

Except installing a fixed kernel, one may try to change the default 4MB and 3MB values of `net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh` and `net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh` (and their IPv6 counterparts `net.ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh` and `net.ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh`) sysctl parameters to 256 kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. The result is from some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware and environment. For example, this mitigation applied to the 32-cores system mentioned above made a high-speed attack (~500 kpps) not noticeable.

There can be some impact on performance though, due to `ipfrag_high_thresh` being set to 262144 bytes, as this way only two 64K fragments can fit in the reassembly queue at the same time. For example, there is a risk of breaking applications that rely on large UDP packets.

The following simple script can be used to quickly change to/from the default and lower settings:

```
#!/bin/sh
if [ "x$1" == "xlow" ]; then
    echo Settinig limits low:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=196608
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=262144
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=196608
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=262144
    echo
elif [ "x$1" == "xdef" ]; then
    echo Settinig limits default:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=4194304
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=3145728
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=4194304
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=3145728
    echo
fi
echo Current values:
sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh
sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh
sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh
sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh

```

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2948)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Package        : linux-4.9
Version        : 4.9.110-3+deb9u2~deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5390 CVE-2018-5391 CVE-2018-13405
Debian Bug     : 893393 903122 903767 903776 903838 903914

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2018-5390 (SegmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that a remote attacker can trigger the
    worst case code paths for TCP stream reassembly with low rates of
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This is mitigated by reducing the default limits on memory usage
    for incomplete fragmented packets.  The same mitigation can be
    achieved without the need to reboot, by setting the sysctls:

    net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608

    The default values may still be increased by local configuration
    if necessary.

CVE-2018-13405

    Jann Horn discovered that the inode_init_owner function in
    fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to create files
    with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to escalate
    privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u2~deb8u1. This update includes fixes for several
regressions in the latest point release.

The earlier version 4.9.110-3+deb9u1~deb8u1 included all the above
fixes except for CVE-2018-5391, which may be mitigated as explained
above.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1609717#c5)  Oleksandr Natalenko    2018-07-30 09:58:15 UTC  ```  === In Red Hat Customer Portal Case 02137847 === --- Comment by Natalenko, Oleksandr on 7/30/2018 11:58 AM ---  Hello.  Thanks for getting back.  Based on all 3 vmcores you've provided we've opened a [BZ 1609717](show_bug.cgi?id=1609717 "CLOSED ERRATA - [unwinder] CPU spins indefinitely in __save_stack_trace() call chain") for the developers to check whether this behaviour of unwinder makes any sense. Once we have more info on the issue, we'll update you.  Thanks for your patience.  The overview of the 3rd vmcore without "onload" module is given below.  ---  Another host, same symptoms:          CPUS: 28         DATE: Wed Jul 25 19:27:43 2018       UPTIME: 00:33:31 LOAD AVERAGE: 45.94, 35.61, 19.27        TASKS: 1116     NODENAME: nickel05.psc.des.co      RELEASE: 3.10.0-862.9.1.el7.x86_64      VERSION: #1 SMP Wed Jun 27 04:30:39 EDT 2018      MACHINE: x86_64  (2599 Mhz)       MEMORY: 255.2 GB        PANIC: "SysRq : Trigger a crash"  Going step by step from the oldest UN task:  crash> ps -S   RU: 42   UN: 32   IN: 1018   ZO: 24  crash> foreach UN ps -m | tail -n 3 [0 00:08:29.107] [UN]  PID: 44142  TASK: ffff9fcd71b1dee0  CPU: 24  COMMAND: "cat" [0 00:08:29.107] [UN]  PID: 44137  TASK: ffff9fcdd87e0000  CPU: 4   COMMAND: "cat" [0 00:08:29.110] [UN]  PID: 44095  TASK: ffff9fcd7fb60fd0  CPU: 25  COMMAND: "cat"  crash> bt 44095 PID: 44095  TASK: ffff9fcd7fb60fd0  CPU: 25  COMMAND: "cat" …  #2 [ffff9fee56693d48] __mutex_lock_killable_slowpath at ffffffffb37125b9 …     ffff9fee56693d70: ffff9fce610a3118 ffff9fce7b31bf40     ffff9fee56693d80: ffff9fee50273140 ffff9fcda178a700     ffff9fee56693d90: ffff9fce7b31bf40 ffff9fee56693db0     ffff9fee56693da0: ffffffffb371268a  #3 [ffff9fee56693da0] mutex_lock_killable at ffffffffb371268a  #4 [ffff9fee56693db8] lock_trace at ffffffffb3292562  #5 [ffff9fee56693dd8] proc_pid_stack at ffffffffb329260e  #6 [ffff9fee56693e30] proc_single_show at ffffffffb3293712  #7 [ffff9fee56693e68] seq_read at ffffffffb3241b80  #8 [ffff9fee56693ed8] vfs_read at ffffffffb321b2ff  #9 [ffff9fee56693f08] sys_read at ffffffffb321c1cf …  It is blocked on the following mutex:  crash> dis -r ffffffffb371268a … 0xffffffffb371265a <mutex_lock_killable+0xa>:   mov    %rdi,%rbx … 0xffffffffb3712682 <mutex_lock_killable+0x32>:  mov    %rbx,%rdi 0xffffffffb3712685 <mutex_lock_killable+0x35>:  callq  0xffffffffb3712487 <__mutex_lock_killable_slowpath> …  crash> dis -r ffffffffb37125b9 | grep push | grep -n rbx 6:0xffffffffb37124a1 <__mutex_lock_killable_slowpath+0x1a>:     push   %rbx  Which has lots of waiters:  crash> struct mutex.count,wait_list,owner ffff9fce610a3118   count = {     counter = 0xfffffff1   }   wait_list = {     next = 0xffff9fee3166fd50,     prev = 0xffff9fc7ff473d70   }   owner = 0xffff9fcdd3addee0  crash> list 0xffff9fee3166fd50 | wc -l 13  And the owner is stuck unwinding the stack:  crash> bt 0xffff9fcdd3addee0 PID: 44085  TASK: ffff9fcdd3addee0  CPU: 7   COMMAND: "cat" …  #3 [ffff9fce801c8ef0] end_repeat_nmi at ffffffffb3717d69     [exception RIP: unwind_next_frame+0x5b]     RIP: ffffffffb306aa9b  RSP: ffff9fcdb5b9fd08  RFLAGS: 00000297     RAX: ffffffffb3afd2d8  RBX: ffff9fcdb5b9fd50  RCX: ffff9fcdb4243b68     RDX: ffff9fcdb4243b60  RSI: 00000000ffffffff  RDI: ffff9fcdb5b9fd50     RBP: ffff9fcdb5b9fd18   R8: 0000000000000000   R9: ffff9fafffc03600     R10: ffffffffb32925e1  R11: ffffffffb31b3aad  R12: ffff9fcdb4243b70     R13: ffff9fcdb4243b68  R14: ffff9fce7b31bf40  R15: ffff9fce7b31bf40     ORIG_RAX: ffffffffffffffff  CS: 0010  SS: 0018 --- <NMI exception stack> ---  #4 [ffff9fcdb5b9fd08] unwind_next_frame at ffffffffb306aa9b     ffff9fcdb5b9fd10: ffff9fcdb4243b70 ffff9fcdb5b9fd40     ffff9fcdb5b9fd20: ffffffffb306abf8  #5 [ffff9fcdb5b9fd20] __unwind_start at ffffffffb306abf8     ffff9fcdb5b9fd28: ffff9fcdb5b9fde0 0000000000000001     ffff9fcdb5b9fd38: 0000000000000000 ffff9fcdb5b9fdc0     ffff9fcdb5b9fd48: ffffffffb303ab5e  #6 [ffff9fcdb5b9fd48] __save_stack_trace at ffffffffb303ab5e …     ffff9fcdb5b9fdc0: ffff9fcdb5b9fdd0 ffffffffb303ac5c  #7 [ffff9fcdb5b9fdc8] save_stack_trace_tsk at ffffffffb303ac5c  #8 [ffff9fcdb5b9fdd8] proc_pid_stack at ffffffffb329264e …     ffff9fcdb5b9fe20: ffffffffb3c4fde0 ffff9fcdb5b9fe60     ffff9fcdb5b9fe30: ffffffffb3293712  #9 [ffff9fcdb5b9fe30] proc_single_show at ffffffffb3293712 #10 [ffff9fcdb5b9fe68] seq_read at ffffffffb3241b80 #11 [ffff9fcdb5b9fed8] vfs_read at ffffffffb321b2ff #12 [ffff9fcdb5b9ff08] sys_read at ffffffffb321c1cf …  The CPU is blocked for a long time too:  crash> runq -T | tail -n 2   CPU 27: 0.33 secs    CPU 7: 508.51 secs  Trying to get some meaningful info.  crash> whatis save_stack_trace_tsk void save_stack_trace_tsk(struct task_struct *, struct stack_trace *);  crash> dis -r ffffffffb329264e … 0xffffffffb3292640 <proc_pid_stack+0xa0>:       lea    -0x48(%rbp),%rsi 0xffffffffb3292644 <proc_pid_stack+0xa4>:       mov    %r15,%rdi … 0xffffffffb3292649 <proc_pid_stack+0xa9>:       callq  0xffffffffb303ac30 <save_stack_trace_tsk> …  So, the tracee (it exists, unlike in previous vmcores) is:  crash> ps -m ffff9fce7b31bf40 [0 00:08:29.107] [IN]  PID: 32561  TASK: ffff9fce7b31bf40  CPU: 19  COMMAND: "repro-kernel-bu"  Note, 8 × 60 + 29 == 509 s, so PID 32561 (tracee) sleeps as long as PID 44085 (tracer) spins.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A3586)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-693.43.1 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1632422)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX

timers subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2017-18344](/security/CVE-2017-18344))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
