[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0122)

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 52.6.0 ESR.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2018-5089, CVE-2018-5091, CVE-2018-5095, CVE-2018-5096, CVE-2018-5097, CVE-2018-5098, CVE-2018-5099, CVE-2018-5102, CVE-2018-5103, CVE-2018-5104, CVE-2018-5117)
* To mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks similar to "Spectre" and "Meltdown", the resolution of performance.now() has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, Jason Orendorff, Looben Yang, Anonymous, Nils, and Xisigr as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, and Jason Orendorff reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 57, Firefox ESR 52.5, and Thunderbird 52.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Works on Linux too.
Dan: did you mean "RTL language" in the new title?
So the trick here is that the Arabic domain is RTL, so it appears on the right of the address bar, but then it gets pushed off by all the spaces and Hebrew text, because we are still left-justifying the contents? IOW, the fix is to make sure that the justification rules on the address bar are such that the actual domain is always visible?

Since this issue has a sec-moderate rating right now I don't want to track it for 56. We're getting close to the 56 release. Happy to take a patch for 56 if we land one.
mak, can you help find someone to work on this?
Do you think it is urgent to fix for 56/57?Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

Forwarding to Panos to evaluate the available resources.
It would be nice to fix it for sure, I don't know if it's as urgent to be in 56, the spoofed font is somehow recognizable and the identity panel points to the right domain. I can see it as a concern for a less expert user.
Surely the best thing would be to always scroll the locationbar to show the domain.Flags: needinfo?(mak77) → needinfo?(past)

We already do that (force selectionStart + End to 0). It's not clear to me off-hand what part of it isn't working somehow.

The url is LTR aligned (https is on the left), but the RTL chars are RTL aligned. And looks like there can be mixed direction domains. The input field is LTR in an LTR build.
There's some background in [bug 993806](/show_bug.cgi?id=993806 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - URL Bar text alignment in RTL mode") and [bug 641238](/show_bug.cgi?id=641238 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - The location bar alignment should be LTR, even though the Firefox build is RTL (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic..) — Regression from Firefox 3.6") for the braves.
Fwiw, Chrome puts the scheme in a static element, and scrolls all the rest of the string to the right. It may not be necessary to keep showing the scheme considered the identity panel? (they also don't decode the %20)

The trouble is, the domain is nowhere near the start (offset 0) of the urlbar content. Setting selectionStart/End to 0 ensures that the left-hand edge of the "https://..." scheme is visible; but then the domain is at the far right of the urlbar content, out of sight.
If I arbitrarily hack browser.js so that it sets selectionStart/End to 8 instead of 0 (i.e. placing the selection immediately after "https://"), then the testcase here behaves better, with the (Arabic-script) domain visible -- although not perfectly, because of the fade-out effect is still applied at the right-hand end, so the beginning of the domain name fades away. And of course now the scheme is no longer visible. So even if we did this (more correctly, by checking the actual offset of the domain rather than hard-coding "8"), it wouldn't be very satisfactory.
If we could avoid decoding the %20 characters, that would help quite a lot, although it could make some legitimate URLs look more ugly. (Note that the %20s in question are part of the fragment identifier here, not part of an actual domain label.) Offhand I'm not sure where to hack that, though.

That's why I'm wondering if, with the identity icon always visible, we still care about the scheme.
If we care, Chrome solution (sticky scheme) sounds feasible.

There's also the issue that the fade-out truncation we apply at the (right-hand) end of the urlbar results in fading the beginning of the domain name.

We could drop the fade out at the end and instead truncate in the middle with an ellipsis (…) so that the beginning and end of the URL are always visible. Is that what you mean by a sticky scheme, Marco?
I agree with Jonathan that not decoding the spaces would help a lot. I'd go further and say that by itself is an acceptable fix for this case. But I think I like the truncation idea, too.

yes, even if I'd not define that "in the middle", it looks like they put ellipsis just after the scheme (so the scheme is "sticky" positioned and the rest of the url is just scrolled to the far right).
Putting ellipsis in the middle, with that many spaces could still be confusing, especially on 16:9 and ultrawide (21:9) screens, the real domain would still be at the far right, while the fake one would still appear just after the scheme.

My interpretation of Chrome's behavior is that the ellipsis is at the (logical) end of the text, which means it appears at the left-hand end of the (right-to-left) text.
Something like this could possibly be achieved by wrapping the URL (not including the scheme) in an inline-block element with dir=auto and styling it with text-overflow:ellipsis, overflow:hidden, and width:.... umm, not sure what. I don't think -moz-available works here, so it might have to be computed somehow.
(Applying text-overflow:ellipsis to the URL as a whole (including scheme) cannot give this result, AFAICT from the spec for text-overflow.)
I suspect forcing the spaces to be displayed as %20 is much easier to implement as a short-term fix, however. Reworking the elements within the urlbar to separate the scheme from the rest of the URL (and allow us to align/truncate them separately) sounds....risky and disruptive.

So, I think that in any case we should show the %20, the spaces are just too confusing.
The 2 proposed solutions:
1. ellipsis in the middle:
- simpler and potentially upliftable
- on overflow it may still look confusing
scheme://fake.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20...%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
2. separate the scheme from the url, ellipsis at the end of the url
- more complex to do
- on overflow it's less confusing
scheme://...e.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
if there's no overflow, the 2 solutions look the same, and the confusion may be solved by the domain hilight. Regardless the hilight helps if we always show the domain, so probably solution 1 has better cost/benefit balance.

Just ensuring the spaces are displayed as %20 goes a long way towards mitigating this, IMO. I think we should do that immediately (and uplift it to 57), and then look into further improvements (either (1) or (2) above) as a followup for 58 or later.

Another interesting POC is using %e30%80%80 instead of %20. Pretty much any recognized whitespace.
To avoid decoding these, it may be enough to fix losslessDecodeURI that currently skips whitespaces on purpose, probably for beautification reasons.
I can try to patch it and see if any tests are failing. It will also need a test for these 2 cases, at least.Assignee: adw → mak77Flags: needinfo?(past)

And here comes back [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow") that makes cropping in the middle a nightmare. It may be easier to actually split the scheme considered that bug is open from 6 years and the proposals got few interest in W3C.
At this point I agree with [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), let's just show the encoded whitespaces and I'll file a separate public bug about cropping the urls better.

This just avoids decoding whitespaces, so they will stay % encoded.
Cropping is a more complex problem we'd better handle separately, I suggest a normal public bug in the Address Bar for that.

Decoding whitespaces is a nice UX win. Can we refuse to decode them only when there's more than N of them, or a run of more than N of them, or something?

We will keep decoding them for javascript or exotic urls, the change only affects http, https, file and ftp schemes. For these I'm not sure there's any UX win.
While your suggestion is technically feasible, it would make the behavior more unpredictable and maybe even surprising, imo.

Fwiw, all the wikis I tried rewrite %20 to underscores, makes more sense imo, web devs should use underscores if they care about readability of their urls. Your example in reality would be <https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/CA_Information_Checklist>
To look into the other browsers, and understand if we're breaking users expectations: Chrome doesn't decode %20, as well as Edge. I don't have Safari at hand atm.
How would you measure the right N? The window and, as a consequence, the Address Bar, can be small. To hide the smaller host possible you may not need a lot of spaces, indeed even if invalid per RFC, some dns may support single letter hostnames.
If we only care to mitigate the problem, we could maybe allow single isolated spaces.
Let's see what the others think.

FWIW, I too think it would be preferable to find a way to keep decoding spaces in the "non-spoofy" cases for UX reasons, even if that makes the behaviour less predictable, because it'll keep the 'nice' behaviour for the common case while defeating spoofing attempts (if done right :-) ).

Even if, something like "<http://fake.domain> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . real.domain" (or some unicode glyph even more subtle than a dot) could still be quite confusing.

The correct fix here is making sure that the real domain is always visible. Combine that with domain highlighting, and we are fine even if spaces are not decoded at all. Let's focus on that. If we want to stopgap by refusing to decode long runs of spaces, let's do it. But we are already at the edge case of edge cases. Phishers don't bother with this stuff for good reasons. It works fine without.

If we want the fix in 57 the only way would be to hide the scheme, and I'm not sure we're comfortable with that.
If we can wait, then surely we could look into the static scheme solution (that off-hand looks easier than waiting for [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow")).

How about a regex something like
/%(?!3B|2F|3F|3A|40|26|3D|2B|24|2C|23)|\s(?=\s)|\s$/
This would mean we'll encode any whitespaces that are followed by a further whitespace, or that occur at the end of the URL. (I'd have liked to catch any whitespaces -preceded- by another whitespace, too, but that would have needed a lookbehind assertion, which AFAIK isn't available in JS regex.)
I agree the proper solution is to make sure the real domain is always visible and highlighted, but I don't think we're going to fix that for 57, so I'd suggest doing a whitespace fix like this as an interim fix that could be safely uplifted (also to ESR if desired).

We should still always encode \r\t\n, even if they are not followed by another whitespace char. In my patch I just replaced them with \s because it was a catch-all solution. Surely it could be adapted, something like [\r\n\t]|\s(?=\s)|\s$
Though, gerv is right the only real solution is to show and hilight the real domain. I was looking for an "almost whitespace char" to see the effect. Replacing isolated spaces in this case doesn't help much, and I didn't search the whole unicode.

At that point, we're getting into territory that's more like the "barely noticeable combining mark" cases -- a glyph that is unambiguously visible (assuming non-broken fonts!), but nevertheless easily overlooked by users who aren't accustomed to noticing it.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8919079)

This is a possible patch. It still lacks tests, but I'd first like to collect some feedback.
\* multiple spaces are encoded as suggested by jfkthame, single spaces are not, so we retain ux advantage.
\* the address bar gradient is on the left or on the right, depending on the overflow direction.
\* there is an overlay label that always shows the scheme when it is overflowed and the url has a host.
\* I didn't use ellipsis because it's impossible without proper text-overflow support. If we'd have a text-overflow where one could define at which char to put the ellipsis, it would be trivial.
I tested this with an ltr long url, and this rtl-host long url, in ltr, rtl and dark theme modes. In all the cases both the scheme and the host are visible and the gradient is on the right side.
The code is not the cleanest, because while it's true we can set the selection to the end of the "scheme://", that still creates situations where the url is overflowed on both sides when moving between states.
It would be much simpler if we'd strip the scheme, but that creates more risks of regressions when we have to put it back, and we'd only strip some schemes, that would make things even more foggy.
Another alternative I tried, was to create a special kind of selection like SELECTION\_OMIT, that would not be drawn to the textrun. Then I could set that on the scheme, and always show the scheme in the separate label. It should be less regression prone, since the actual input value wouldn't change.
Unfortunately I'm not very good at layout code, I successfully introduced the selection type globally, but my changes to nsTextFrame.cpp didn't seem to work. Thus I don't know if it would properly align. Regardless, I'd need help implementing the omit selection type in the text frame, if we want to try that approach.
What do you think?

I tried this patch in a local build (based on current m-c tip), and while it seems like a possible way forward, I observed a couple of glitches that will need further work. As a testcase, I took the URL generated by the PoC here ([comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references")).
(a) When I paste this URL into the address bar of a new tab and press Enter, it is displayed with the https:// scheme visible (as expected), but then the URL is left-aligned, meaning that the fake "no.io" domain (actually part of the fragment id) appears after the scheme, followed by the sequence of spaces (all but one %20-encoded). The same occurs if I navigate to the URL by choosing it from the History menu. Also, note that the fade-out gradient is missing at this point.
(b) If I switch to a different tab, and then return to my test tab with the long URL, it now displays right-aligned, so that the real domain (اسماء.شبكة) is visible. However, the sequence of %20-encoded spaces in the fragment identifier are overprinting the still-visible scheme.
I'll attach screenshots of (a) and (b) as seen on my system.

Personally, I'd still favor doing a minimal patch that %-encodes multiple spaces (i.e. just the regex change in function losslessDecodeURI) and trying to uplift that to 57, as I think it's a useful mitigation with minimal risk. Then all further improvements would go into a future release. But I recognize I'm not an owner/peer here, so it's not my call.

uh, this is strange, did you use --purgecaches? In particular it's strange that the label is missing the background since it's part of its css :\ I'll try to reproduce btw.

No, I wasn't aware of that. Just tried it, though, and I'm still seeing the issues. The exact result (a) seems to vary -- a couple of times, it's appeared with the gradient on the scheme at the left, though still showing the wrong part of the URL; case (b) with the overpainted scheme after switching tabs seems consistently reproducible.

Ah, problem b) is related to the fact I was testing using Dark Theme. The css needs some tweaks for the default theme.
Problem a) seems to depend on whether the text was already overflowed before pasting.

This definitely looks better; I can no longer reproduce (b) at all, AFAICT.
I can still see some behavioral glitches, though, including a form of (a) in certain circumstances. I'll try to give STR that reliably misbehave for me:
(a) Visit the test URL from the PoC in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), so that it gets into History.
Open a new browser window (NOT a new tab in the same window).
Choose the test site's from the History menu.
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, so the wrong part of it (the fake "no.io") is visible.
Note that this only seems to happen for the first tab in a window.
(b) Visit the test URL from the PoC.
Copy the entire long URL to the clipboard.
Paste it back into the URL bar (overwriting the copy that's already there).
Press Enter to confirm ("navigating" to the page we're already on).
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, with a fade applied to the left-hand end.
>> Also, note that the https:// scheme label is missing.
(c) Visit the test URL from the PoC.
Switch to a different tab, then return to the PoC tab.
(In my experience, this fixes glitches such as (a) and (b) above, so the URL is now displayed as intended.)
>> The scheme label (https://) is slightly misaligned, about a pixel or two higher than the text of the URL.
(d) Open a new tab.
In the URL bar, start typing a really long URL. (Its content is irrelevant, just random text will do.)
Observe what happens when the text reaches the end of the visible URL bar width.

Thank you, that was useful, all the reported issues should be fixed.
I'm not 100% sure about the text misalignment, since so far I only tested on Win, but I changed the alignment approach for a simple box centering.
I'll start looking into what I can add a test for.

I agree. This patch is a bit hard to evaluate since it tries to do different mostly unrelated things, there are many edge cases to consider, and the code isn't the cleanest, as Marco admitted. Can we just encode spaces here and move the other ideas to followups?Flags: needinfo?(dao+bmo)

The newest patch is much cleaner, surely there are a few edge cases, but in practice it relies on the formatting code now, that is well tested. Have a look at it, I think it's a pretty good MVP.
We can surely land the fixed at different times, but there are 2 reasons I didn't:
1. uplifiting to 57 is very unlikely, per rel-eng decisions, so the benefit of splitting for 58 is minor
2. even with the whitespaces fix, the bug is not really fixed, since the host is still not visible. It would make the url less confusable just for more savvy users. And by landing the first part we'd practically expose the problem without having the final fix at hand.

I tested briefly again with the new patch; this is definitely a lot more stable. At this point, I've only noticed a couple of relatively minor glitches (again, I'm testing on a Mac, in case this has any significance):
1. Open a new window.
2. Load the test URL from the PoC above (the "fake no.io").
> It displays correctly, with the Arabic-script domain visible at the right, the scheme visible at the left, and the long URL truncated (with fade-out) before it hits the scheme
3. Now, assume we want to edit the URL. So click in it, let's say at the dot in the domain name.
> The focus goes to the URL bar, and the entire URL is selected
> HOWEVER, sometimes (maybe one in three or four times, the URL "jumps" horizontally so that the domain is no longer visible, and I'm looking at a run of encoded spaces (%20%20%20%20...)
4a. Click in the (now-selected) URL a second time, to place an insertion point for editing.
> If the URL didn't "jump-scroll" in the previous step, this behaves fine. If it did, the insertion point seems to be misplaced by a few characters from where I clicked.
4b. Instead of clicking in the selected URL to begin editing, I change my mind and click back in the content of the page.
> The URL bar loses focus, but in the process its content momentarily jumps to the wrong end of its scroll range, before reverting to the expected right-aligned scroll position. This produces a distracting visual flicker as the text skips back and forth.

I fear the jumping issue is due to the underlying editor and I'd not have much control over that from the urlbar code.
If it just happens for overflowed urls with RTL domains, it sounds like an edge case, so we may ignore it for now. I'll have a look at it.

This may be unavoidable unless we have a way to tell if the first char after the scheme is RTL. Do you know if we have something like that exposed to js?

After some testing, I think this is a bug somewhere in the editor or the selection code, that is uncovered by the rtl selection. Indeed the only thing we do is a call to .selectAll(). I don't have much control over that, but it seems rare enough to not be a blocker.

It's not limited to cases that involve RTL; I've also seen it with purely LTR long URLs. But on checking, I find that I can also reproduce it (intermittently) in a current nightly (i.e. without the patch here), in the existing URL bar. So as you say, it's not an issue with this patch; it seems to be a bug elsewhere in editor/selection handling.

Drive-by (sorry) - this should have a check against re-entrancy (ditto for the further-nested updates a bit further down).

I'm afraid the whole .urlbar-scheme-box[scheme][textoverflow="start"] thing is an edge case. :/
It will be easy to regress and we won't necessarily catch that in nightly testing.

With the whitespce fix, this bug doesn't seem severe enough to me to be concerned about that. But we can land without a commit message and keep this bug marked security-sensitive for as long as we want.

Hmm, this isn't how SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY works. It explicitly doesn't use the alpha channel since this might get us grayscale anti-aliasing:

It is sort-of an edge case, but this bug is about an edge case.
I agree it's something we may miss in Nightly, that's why I added a test, so we don't regress.

If dveditz is fine with that, no problem on my side.
I still think not showing the domain doesn't really fix anything for the non-technical users, it will just be a weak indicator: "something looks strange, but I see a host here".
But for the next version I will split the patch into the 2 parts.

I want to address the re-entrancy Gijs pointed out and re-test for this tab switching case, I didn't see it on Win/Mac.
I suppose the 1px offset is not a critical problem, considered as you said this is an edge case, and security comes first.

I know, but I have no way to reproduce what the textframe is doing.
Is it critical to have subpixel AA in a small label shown in edge cases? Any alternative suggestion on how to achieve that?

If we want to commit to doing this, I'd rather do it right. These kind of glitches that aren't covered by the test and will only add up over time are exactly what concerns me.

Perhaps use a textframe with SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY?

Attached patch

[part 1 - Don't decode adjacent spaces](attachment.cgi?id=8926403&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8926403&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8926403)

This is the part we agree upon: don't decode consecutive spaces. It preserves UX for urls having single spaces to separate words, but makes long runs of spaces visible and likely warnings the user something may be wrong.
I'm still looking at the second part (always show the domain) to see if I can reproduce the reported intermittent issues.
Daniel, would you be fine with landing the first part for now, so that consecutive spaces are shown encoded, and keep the second part for later when we are more comfortable with it?
Do you think there's risk exposing a partial fix to the problem?

I'd leave the reference to that old bug and tweak the wording a bit:
"Re-encode select whitespace so that it doesn't get eaten away by the location bar ([bug 410726](/show_bug.cgi?id=410726 "RESOLVED FIXED - address bar eats escaped newlines")). Re-encode all adjacent whitespace to prevent spoofing attempts where invisible characters would push part of the URL to overflow the location bar."
Maybe also add a reference to this bug. Blame is a bit annoying here because these lines tend to get touched again and again.

I've updated the comment locally, though now it's basically exposing what this bug is about and how to reproduce it.
Imo that forces us to move the remaining work to a separate bug. Let's see what Daniel thinks.

I agree w/Dão that we shouldn't remove the old bug reference and should add a reference to this bug.
Should be fine to land just this part -- spaces are already known to be spoofy and nothing here references the RTL aspect.

Can we add a test with two embedded spaces (possibly different ones, like %20%C2%A0) to show the expected "%20 " behavior and not " %C2%A0"?

What did you update the comment to? If you take the comment I saw and just stick "([bug 1395508](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"))" on the end it's not revealing the key part of this. Even if it does I'd prefer keeping the work in this bug. Something like

should be fine, and then keep the remaining work in this bug.

We will actually show "%20%C2%A0" and not " %C2%A0" because they are considered consecutive spaces and thus re-encoded by this patch. I still added the test, I hope it's ok, it should be from the point of view of this report.

Not sure why this has been marked as fixed on 58, likely a mistake.

We should, because these spoofs are easy to construct once people think about it, and the patch is small and straightforward.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

This seems to pass tests on Try, the test is the same as in Nightly. It makes sense since [bug 1402715](/show_bug.cgi?id=1402715 "VERIFIED FIXED - [regression] Spaces are folded when copying from urlbar") fixes a regression that happened in v53.

I tried to reproduce and verify the fix of this issue. Based on [Comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), I suppose that the fixed builds should displayed the real domain (سماء.شبكة). Compared with Chrome, where the real domain is always in focus, on Firefox the domain is displayed only at the end of the URL (can be seen only by using the horizontal scroll). Not sure what the fix should be here! Am I missing something?
Configuration used:
- OS: Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.13.2
- Affected builds: 57.0a1 (2017-08-31), Release 57.0.4
- Fixed builds: Latest Nightly (2018-01-22), Beta 58.0b16Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

Yes, the "always show domain" fix didn't land here but has been moved to [bug 1419391](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419391 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), because the patch is fragile due to missing editor APIs and there's some discussion about a completely new approach for the Address Bar that would be less likely to suffer from spoofing attempts. That didn't happen yet.
What landed here is the patch that decodes multiple whitespaces when they are adjacent, that by itself makes the user less likely to fall for the spoofing attempt since there's no long empty space after the fake domain making it look good.Flags: needinfo?(mak77)

I retested this issue, by taking into account the information mentioned above, on latest Nightly 60.0a1 (2018-01-22) and on Release 58.06 - build 6 under Windows 10 x64, Ubuntu 12.04 x32 and macOS 10.13. I can mark this bug as verified fixed.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, and Jason Orendorff reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 57 and Firefox ESR 52.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Thunderbird mail
client: Multiple memory safety errors, use after free, integer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to crashes or the execution of
arbitrary code.
