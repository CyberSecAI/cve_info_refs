The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the `gd-rating-system` WordPress plugin.  The vulnerabilities are XSS and Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root cause:** The `panel` parameter in multiple admin pages of the `gd-rating-system` plugin is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious script.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Lack of input sanitization for the `panel` parameter.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*  **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL and enticing an authenticated admin user to access the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to convince an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious crafted URL.

The vulnerable admin pages include:
    * `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-information`
    * `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-about`
    * `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-transfer`
    * `admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-tools`

**LFI Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root cause:** The `panel` parameter in multiple admin pages of the `gd-rating-system` plugin is used in an `include` statement without sufficient validation, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary local files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Unrestricted file inclusion vulnerability through the `$_panel` variable in the `include` statement.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the webserver, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks if the included file is an executable script.
*   **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL with a path traversal payload in the `panel` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress administrator.

The vulnerable files include:
   * `/forms/information.php`
   * `/forms/about.php`
   * `/forms/transfer.php`
   * `/forms/tools.php`

The vulnerable code is similar across the vulnerable files, and takes the following form:
```php
include(GDRTS_PATH.'forms/panels/'.$_panel.'.php');
```

The attacker can use the `panel` parameter to traverse up the directory tree to include any file within the server's filesystem, as demonstrated in the proof-of-concept URLs provided.
