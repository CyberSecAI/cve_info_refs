Steps to reproduce:
AesTask:: DoCrypt() in dom/crypto/WebCryptoTask.cpp
potential integer overflow. if dataLen is bigger than or equal to 0xfffffff0, maxLen would overflow, so mResult's length would be a small integer. then calling PK11\_Encrypt or PK11\_Decrypt could cause writing beyond mResult's buffer
uint32\_t dataLen = mData.Length();
uint32\_t maxLen = dataLen + 16;
if (!mResult.SetLength(maxLen, fallible)) {
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_UNKNOWN\_ERR;

Can we have JavaScript strings big enough to cause this in practice? Maybe if dataLen is bytes and JS string length is characters?

This shouldn't be exploitable. We pass `mResult.Length()` to both the encrypt and decrypt function. That's the `maxLen` argument. If the ciphertext and plaintext doesn't fit they'll both fail instead of writing OOB.

I've made a simple test case to construct a giant string. It fails allocating a string of 0xfffffff1 length with:
uncaught exception: out of memory
Test case: <https://usr.bin.coffee/bigstring/>

it's a potential bug.
webcrypto would call this passing data using arraybuffer.
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/encrypt>
and arraybuffer's max length is Number.MAX\_SAFE\_INTEGER
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer>
I tested on Firefox with ArrayBuffer's max length which is ```new Uint8Array(0x7ffffffe)```, but if the max length of ArrayBuffer is changed in the future, this might be a problem.

I didn't see any check about MaxLen in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11obj.c#945>
maybe it would be checked in C\_Encrypt?
crv = PK11\_GETTAB(slot)->C\_Encrypt(session, (unsigned char \*)data,
dataLen, out, &len);

I add a breakpoint in C\_Encrypt and quickly fails into NSC\_Encrypt, NSC\_Encrypt didn't check the `len`, and directly use `len` in crv = NSC\_EncryptUpdate(hSession, pData, ulDataLen, pEncryptedData,
pulEncryptedDataLen);
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/softoken/pkcs11c.c#1370>

Right, NSC\_EncryptUpdate() does the following:
> unsigned int maxout = \*pulEncryptedPartLen;
And that's what all of these functions have to do. And are hopefully doing. It's not ideal but with a generic layer like that we can't know what output buffer requirements different crypto algorithms have.
AES\_Encrypt() for example has all the proper checks before writing to a given buffer.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/rijndael.c#1052>
GCM\_EncryptUpdate() too:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/gcm.c#660>
That said, it might not hurt to try and fuzz these APIs directly with at least the common algorithms.
We could definitely be paranoid and ensure that `dataLen < 0xfffffff0` in the WebCrypto API.

Yes, it should apply policies automatically. Not entirely sure why it didn't this time, after we fixed it... anyway we're making some changes to this code to make it a bit more robust.

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Long-standing bug.
[User impact if declined]: Highly unlikely OOB write when passing a gigantic ArrayBuffer to the WebCrypto API, hitting an algorithm or PKCS11 module that doesn't properly check buffer lengths. All algorithms exposed by us via the WebCrypto API seem to do all the required checks.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: We can't really verify this.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.
[Is the change risky?]: No.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This small patch adds a simple test to check whether an integer addition will overflow. We have automated tests that tell that the check seems fine and doesn't reject valid data.
[String changes made/needed]: None.Flags: needinfo?(ttaubert)

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

##### References

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1421099](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421099)

#### [#CVE-2018-5109: Audio capture prompts and starts with incorrect origin attribution](#CVE-2018-5109)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An audio capture session can started under an incorrect origin from the site making the capture request. Users are still prompted to allow the request but the prompt can display the wrong origin, leading to user confusion about which site is making the request to capture an audio stream.

##### References

* [Bug 1405599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599)

#### [#CVE-2018-5110: Cursor can be made invisible on OS X](#CVE-2018-5110)

Reporter

* [Bug 1423275](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1423275)

#### [#CVE-2018-5111: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop](#CVE-2018-5111)

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Jonathan: will [bug 1370497](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") (spoofy combining marks) address this one, too?
Also like the Arabic character that inspired that bug, the mark in this bug is below the bottom of the text box we show in the Address Bar, although it looks like there ought to be enough whitespace to have shown it. Should that be filed as a separate UX bug? On Mac, anyway, it looks like a normal 'e' with space after it, but if you copy-paste it elsewhere you'll see the dot/ring thing that's below the e further down than the 'g' descender goes (the display box seems to stop at or maybe a pixel below the 'g' descender).Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Since the combining marks are certainly a dupe of [bug 1370497](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") maybe we should morph this bug into one to cover us not showing the full height required for some characters/combinations.

AFAICS, it should do. These marks have Script=Tibetan, so the patch there will reject them (i.e. force punycode display) if they're applied to Latin letters.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

They're not actually blank in any of the Mac fonts (at least on my 10.12 system), which was the issue with several other Tibetan characters in [bug 1390980](/show_bug.cgi?id=1390980 "RESOLVED FIXED - Domain spoofing thanks to U+0F8C rendered as 'space' on Mac OS 10.11"). But as Dan notes, they are sufficiently low down that they are clipped (or largely clipped -- see the residual dots in the "blank" space in [attachment 8912018](/attachment.cgi?id=8912018 "Screen Shot 2017-09-25 at 22.48.44.png") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8912018&action=edit "Screen Shot 2017-09-25 at 22.48.44.png")) from the URL bar field, although they show in the tab title.

The line-height of the <html:input> at the heart of the urlbar is set to `inherit` which inherits `-moz-use-system-font`. Why is that not sufficient to display the entirety of the text? (Changing it to e.g. 1.6em seems like it might help, but...)

Because we're seeing characters that aren't supported by the system font (SFNS Text), so font fallback comes into play, and is finding large-repertoire CJK fonts where some of these characters are positioned significantly lower than the metrics of the system font would allow for.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

So, we can compensate for the characters in question with a simple CSS fix, I think, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient if other such characters appear, because I assume that, in principle, there is no limit to how tall the characters will be. Is that right?
I don't see any overflow set on the input or its descendants or its ancestors, so I can only assume that things being cut off is the result of layout treating HTML <input> things "specially", so I doubt we can do anything about that...

There's a property "overflow: -moz-hidden-unscrollable" in urlbar-searchbar.inc.css, which I think has some relevance here, but AFAICT just changing this (e.g. to visible) is not sufficient to solve things here. It does mean you can drag-scroll the content of the URL-bar upwards to see the low marks, but I don't think we really want that result anyhow.

This seems reasonable to me, and certainly helps, but I'm not really a valid reviewer for front-end stuff.
FWIW, in my testing setting a line-height of 1.7em causes a \*very\* slight shift of the text baseline in the URL bar, though it's too slight to matter, I expect. But you might want to consider 1.67em, which AFAICS causes no visible shift at all. (With current system fonts on 10.12; of course, font changes in future OS versions might affect this.)

I don't think so. That's applied on the <xul:textbox/>, but text already can't overflow the anonymous <html:input/>.

That's true, but it seems unlikely things will get much worse than this. Note that we're only dealing with the system fonts that may get used as a result of fallback for obscure characters; we don't have to worry about a malicious site deploying a webfont with extremely high or low glyphs, as they won't be used in the URL bar anyhow.

Right, I tried removing this or replacing with an explicit overflow:visible, and that had no effect.

Yep, this is why I also asked Dão for a review. I wanted both of your opinions. :-)

Right, I noticed this, but I didn't think it was a big deal, effectively. The overall size of the urlbar is unchanged, as far as I can see, and the identity block text is shifted in the same way so the alignment doesn't really change, either.
When using 1.67em, there is indeed no shift but these characters are also slightly cut-off at the bottom still. I guess the question is how important that is, and I don't speak Tibetan, nor do I know if there are other languages that would be implicated here, so I don't know how to determine that.

I do notice that now, it no longer seems to be the case that the EV label moves, so if we do this only on mac, I guess we have to apply the same line-height to the EV label.

Mac-specific patch works for me. It makes me a bit nervous that this can affect the location bar height at all, but I suppose that's only a hypothetical concern on Mac. I also wonder if this affects the vertical text alignment. Have you checked that normal URLs (no Tibetan characters) are positioned as before?Flags: needinfo?(dao+bmo)

Tested on both compact and normal mode, this doesn't vertically shift the text or change the height of the urlbar. Confusingly, a slightly lower value of 1.7em does vertically shift the text (but doesn't change the height of the textbox), and then a slightly higher value puts it back. I assume there's a rounding issue somewhere, but given that this works I think it's OK. Note that the 1.745 value matches 24px (default font size is 11px but the urlbar gets font-size: 1.25em, so 13.75, and 24/13.75 is 1.745). I can also use 24px but I figured we should stick with em as that's what we use elsewhere.

Note that [bug 1399939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399939 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive") mitigates this by turning the IDN restrictions up to 'high' (you can test by simply flipping the pref back to "moderate", which works at runtime). I figure taking this is probably still a good idea to avoid not displaying certain text on OS X, or in case we have to back out the IDN restriction change if we run into web compact issues or something like that.

To be clear, this was a barely-observable shift of 1 device pixel (ie 0.5 css px) on a hidpi device, so it's not exactly earth-shattering, but hey.

Assuming [bug 1399939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399939 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive") sticks, is this still a more realistic concern on Mac than on other platforms? If not, I suggest we just close this as fixed.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Well, there are scripts where these characters are legitimate, so we're basically still cropping bits that we shouldn't. I don't know if that's a concern given the font thingymajig that's going on with this particular character vs. more "normal" text. Jonathan can hopefully answer that question more conclusively.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(jfkthame)

The location bar on OS X currently crops some legitimate diacritics, e.g. in Arabic, which could lead to ambiguity/spoofability for purely Arabic-script IDNs. As such, I think it's worth taking the patch here in order to reduce the risk of such clipping.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

Note that as of v59, <input> no longer clips the text at the content edge
(in the vertical direction), but instead at the padding edge (by default).
So that should also give some more room to display text in the URL bar, IIUC.

Because of its severity rating, it did not qualify for a bounty (this happened in Dan's comment back in 2017.) The flag update I just performed was to ensure that your name does get added to our [Hall of Fame](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/hall-of-fame/) however.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
