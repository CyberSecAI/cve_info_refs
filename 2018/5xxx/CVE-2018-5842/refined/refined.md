{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper bounds check in WLAN driver when handling specific frame types.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP) due to missing bounds check.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially escalate their privileges on the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the WLAN interface using specially crafted frame types.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within range of the device's WiFi and be able to send malicious network frames. No specific authentication or prior access to the device is mentioned."
