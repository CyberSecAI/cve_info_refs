  "CVE-2018-5173": {
    "description": "The filename appearing in the `Downloads` panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from user view in the panel.\n*Note: the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not.*",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The filename in the Downloads panel improperly renders some Unicode characters, specifically the Right-to-Left Override (RLO) character (\\u202E).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Unicode characters, leading to filename spoofing"
      ],
      "impact": "Filename spoofing in the Downloads panel, which can obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from the user's view. This could trick users into executing malicious files.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious website or WebExtension can provide a crafted filename containing the RLO character when initiating a download through `browser.downloads.download()`",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to initiate a file download with a controlled filename, either by hosting a malicious website, or through a malicious browser extension. This does not require any special permissions.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists because the browser.downloads.download API does not strip or escape bidirectional formatting characters from filenames before rendering them in the UI. While the dialog to open the file will show the full, correct filename, the initial presentation in the Downloads panel is spoofed. This vulnerability was addressed by stripping all BIDI characters from the filename in the DownloadPaths.sanitize() method. Additionally, web extensions will now throw if a sanitized filename differs from the original."
