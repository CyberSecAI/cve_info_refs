Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper parameter validation when processing IPC (Inter-Process Communication) messages. Specifically, malformed IPC messages could lead to an out-of-bounds write during message processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which means that the program writes data to a memory location outside the intended buffer. This can lead to data corruption, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Insufficient Parameter Validation:** The lack of validation of parameters from IPC messages allows an attacker to send malformed messages that can trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sandbox Escape:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to escape the sandbox, meaning an attacker could elevate privileges to the parent process where the browser or application resides, or compromise the host operating system.
*  **Denial of service:** An exploitable crash can result in a denial of service, rendering the application unusable.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the process if an attacker is able to control the out-of-bounds write.
*  **Information Disclosure:** It's noted that some of the related fixes address memory corruption issues which could lead to information disclosure if exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed IPC messages:** Attackers can send malformed IPC messages to the vulnerable process.
*   **Web Content:** The vulnerability can potentially be triggered by a malicous website.
*   **Compromised GMP process:** The vulnerability can be triggered from a compromised GMP process by sending specially crafted IPC messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to send malformed IPC messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted IPC messages to the vulnerable process. This implies a compromised process, or some other way to send the malformed message.
*   **Ability to load a malicious page:** Users must be tricked into opening a malicous website.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Applications:** The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed by updating to specific versions of the affected software (e.g. Firefox ESR 52.7.1, Thunderbird 52.7.0, Firefox 59).
*  **MFSA:** This vulnerability is also addressed in the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory MFSA 2018-07.

The provided information details an out-of-bounds write vulnerability that is triggered by malformed IPC messages, which can lead to a variety of consequences. The core problem is the lack of validation, which should be addressed in order to protect against any related attacks.
