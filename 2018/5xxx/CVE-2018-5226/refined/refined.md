- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Argument injection in Sourcetree for Windows via Mercurial repository tag names. Specifically, when deleting a tag, the tag's name was not properly sanitized before being passed as an argument to a command, allowing for injection of malicious commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Argument injection vulnerability
    - Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input (Mercurial tag names)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE) on the system where Sourcetree for Windows is installed. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Sourcetree.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with the permission to create a tag on a Mercurial repository linked in Sourcetree for Windows can inject malicious commands through the tag name. The vulnerability is triggered when the user attempts to delete a malicious tag in Sourcetree.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to create tags on a Mercurial repository that is linked to a vulnerable Sourcetree for Windows installation.
    - The user of the vulnerable Sourcetree for Windows instance must attempt to delete the malicious tag.
