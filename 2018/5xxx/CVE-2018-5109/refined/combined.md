Attached file
[test.html](attachment.cgi?id=8915061)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8915061&action=edit)

Found while investigating [bug 1403186](/show_bug.cgi?id=1403186 "RESOLVED FIXED - SEGV at null in [@fetch_add]").
STR:
1 host test.html locally with e.g., `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2 `MOZ\_LOG=timestamp,MediaManager:5 ./mach run localhost:8000/test.hml`
Expected:
No gUM permission prompt
Actual:
gUM permission prompt that asks for permission for audio capture for "mozilla.github.io". Also, clicking "Allow" results in starting audio capture.
I have not been able to circumvent the permission prompt. So storing a persistent permission for <https://mozilla.github.io> still results in a prompt.
I have not been able to start video capture this way. There is a guard at [1] which is probably what is catching this.
I am not sure whether one can do anything with the audio. It cannot be ruled out.
The captured audio stops after a while, presumable because GC collects the track. I have not investigated persisting the capture for longer.

Guard mediaDevices APIs from an invalid window
Is there a spec saying to do these checks? If so, what exception does it say to throw, and what actual check does it say to do? I doubt it says to throw NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE!
If there's no spec saying to do this, have you raised a spec issue? The spec should presumably say something here.Flags: needinfo?(apehrson)

Andreas, you've verified this patch fixes the problem?

> Is there a spec saying to do these checks?
There's no mention of anything like this in the mediacapture spec [1][2].
Note that this situation is the result of fuzzing with window.location.href = newurl; From [attachment 8915061](/attachment.cgi?id=8915061 "test.html") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8915061&action=edit "test.html"):
try { o1 = new XMLHttpRequest({mozAnon: true}) } catch(e) { }
try { o2 = window.navigator } catch(e) { }
try { o3 = o2.plugins } catch(e) { }
try { o4 = o2.mediaDevices } catch(e) { }
window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"
try { o1.open("T", "",false) } catch(e) { }
try { o1.send("") } catch(e) { }
try { o4.getUserMedia({audio: true, video: false, fake: false}) } catch(e) { }
I don't know enough about how window.location.href works here, but once this run of the event loop has finished, will there even any code left to observe a returned promise from o4.getUserMedia()?
> If there's no spec saying to do this, have you raised a spec issue? The spec should presumably say something here.
Is this something individual domain specs are expected to handle? Is there a common pattern, or existing spec prose you could point me to as an example?

I mean in the case where this patch would reject with NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE.

I guess the microtask queue would still run, so nm. Would it be better to return a Promise that never resolves here?

Patch aside, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around what code, if anything, can still be alive from the original test.html page once
window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"
has gotten far enough that we're seeing that origin in the permission prompt, and users had moused over to click "Accept"? - Is there an vector here for an attacker to record the user?

Why does code have to be alive from the test.html page?
You can load a page in a subframe (or window.open it), then grab the relevant objects from it, then navigate the page to a new origin, then call methods on the objects you grabbed, no?
> There's no mention of anything like this in the mediacapture spec [1][2].
Ok, that presumably needs fixing.
> Is this something individual domain specs are expected to handle?
Yes, depending on what "this" is. In general, specs are expected to think about what happens if their APIs are invoked in the context of a document that is not "active" or "fully active" in the sense of <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#active-document> and <<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#fully-active>>. For many APIs it's not a problem. For some it could be.
In any case, it seems like the problem on our end is that the prompt's origin is derived from a WindowProxy somehow, not from a Window. It's entirely possible that the spec simply assumes people won't do that (and indeed, they should not!).Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

> Ok, that presumably needs fixing.
That's \_if\_ the spec assumes you go through windowproxies at some point.
But even if it doesn't. I suspect that having permission prompts coming up for non-fully-active documents is weird and should not happen. Perhaps this should be handled by <https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#request-permission-to-use>

> Andreas, you've verified this patch fixes the problem?
Yes, as in with the test case the permission prompt no longer appears. Just as getting navigator.mediaDevices for the first time would throw too.
FWIW, This is the relevant bit I find in mediacapture-main [1]:
> When the getUserMedia() method is called, the User Agent MUST run the following steps:

This is outside my comfort zone, but on a hunch, does it mean anything that "Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing context's origin." happens in parallel here (e.g., after `window.location.href = "<https://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/gum_test.html>"`)?

Good idea. I can repro that (get the misleading prompt) by hitting "Run" on <https://jsfiddle.net/jib1/aLbn85ku/8/> roughly ~1/20th of the time, sometimes much more frequently. But the promise never resolves when I hit "Allow", so maybe no recording risk.
More good news, even when I have persistent permission already granted for the good site (webrtc-landing), I still get prompted (even though we haven't implemented [bug 1299577](/show_bug.cgi?id=1299577 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Double-key origin for getUserMedia in iframes.") which is step 5 in the prose mentioned in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audio capture can start under wrong origin")). In the prompt I still get, if I check the "Remember this decision" box, the prompt UX says "Your connection is not secure...". Not sure how it figured that out since everything is https here, but go principals! Same for camera (s/audio: true/video: true/).

Good point, though from a quick search I see very few specs test for "fully active" on initial invocation. For those that do, I see InvalidStateError, TypeError, SecurityError. I guess we can take our pick?

How do we tell if it's a proxy?

I like that idea. Then we could throw NotAllowedError here.

Cc'ing Florian to see if he thinks [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1405599#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Audio capture can start under wrong origin") is an issue that extends to permissions outside of getUserMedia, or it's not if there's precedence on how to handle this.

> 4. Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing context's origin.
Oh, boy.
1) A browsing context does not have a concept of "origin".
2) Touching a browsing context in an "in parallel" section is not OK.
3) The top-level browsing context may not have anything to do with the API being invoked,
as in the testcases in this bug.
Basically, this algorithm needs to capture the origin from a sane place before going parallel. Right now it's not doing any of those things.
> does it mean anything that "Let originIdentifier be the [HTML52] top-level browsing
> context's origin." happens in parallel
Yes, it means that it's bogus spec text (or a threadsafety violation in implementation terms).
> But the promise never resolves when I hit "Allow", so maybe no recording risk.
Right, behavior of promises in navigated-away-from documents is ... complicated. Also not specified anywhere; the ES spec which defines promises has no concept of navigation.
> I guess we can take our pick?
Works for me. Just don't use Gecko-internal XPConnect error types like NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE. ;)
> How do we tell if it's a proxy?
I'm not sure what you mean. In spec terms, a WindowProxy is the JS object that more or less corresponds to a browsing context, effectively. It's the \_only\_ JS object for windows exposed to script. It generally forwards access on it to the current Window in the browsing context. A Window is the thing that's actually loaded at any given time.
In implementation terms in Firefox, if you're in JS, you have a WindowProxy. If you're in C++, and have a docshell, that's a browsing context. If you have an nsGlobalWindow, it could be an "inner" (spec Window) or an "outer" (spec WindowProxy).
Looks to me like the spec quoted above is looking at browsing contexts (though it doesn't define how it does that, exactly). So yes, it's going to get results that may have nothing to do with anything. It needs to not do that unless it's enforcing that those browsing contexts are somehow related to the API being called. If it checks "fully active", that's good enough; then it could examine the origins of the active documents in the relevant browsing contexts.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

I have not actually verified, but yes I think this would not be specific to getUserMedia.

This is a MediaStreamError for now, since our OnError() path doesn't support DOMException. We should turn the MediaStreamErrors into DOMExceptions some time in the future.

GetUserMedia should reject when document not fully active
Please don't reinvent nsPIDOMWindowInner::IsCurrentInnerWindow.
But also, this is not checking for "fully active". It's checking for "active". Kind of. It's possible for aWindow to not be current but its document to be active (e.g. in a document.open()) case. That's why we have nsIDocument::IsCurrentActiveDocument. And again, that doesn't test "fully active". We don't actually have a convenient way of testing "fully active" right now...

Again, this is \_not\_ the right test for the spec concept of "active document". Please use the nsIDocument API I pointed to above.

If we know we have an outer, we should really be able to use nsGlobalWindow::GetRealFrameElementOuter.

frameElement->OwnerDoc(), which is guaranteed to never be null.

##### References

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1421099](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421099)

#### [#CVE-2018-5109: Audio capture prompts and starts with incorrect origin attribution](#CVE-2018-5109)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson

#### [#CVE-2018-5111: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop](#CVE-2018-5111)

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

##### References

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

|  | |

STR:
1. in a normal tab, open a page with this code:
var b = new Blob(["<script>var a = new BroadcastChannel('b'); a.onmessage = e => { alert(e.data); }</" + "script>"], { type: 'text/html' });
var u = URL.createObjectURL(b);
console.log(u);
2. open a private browsing window with the blobURL shown in the web console.
3. in the web console for the normal tab do:
var a = new BroadcastChannel('b');
a.postMessage(42);
Expected result:
First of all, a blob URL generated on a normal tab should not be accessible from a private browsing tab. Additionally, it should not be able to receive messages from the normal tab.
Note that this is not a bug in BroadcastChannel, but it's related on how we treat blob URLs.
This test works on any OriginAttributes segregation: containers, first party isolation and so on.
We should probably revisit the idea of keeping the principal together with a blob URL, via nsIURIWthPrincipal.

blobUrl\_subsumes.patch
Doesn't this break sensing blob urls across cross-domain windows and loading urls in non-original window?
Please test, and perhaps test also some other browser too.
But I assume that just works atm.

This bug should me marked as sec-moderate. Patch landing because this issue can be reproduced only if the user users a blobURL as top-level URL manually.

This patch breaks a feature in Firefox Screenshots: screenshots can no longer be downloaded in 'never remember history' mode[1].
The Screenshots implementation involves generating a blob from a canvas in content[2], sending the blob to the webextension background page[3], then triggering a download from the background page[4]. This patch (deliberately) breaks the messaging step.
Is there any way we could restore the Screenshots download feature when history is disabled?
We'd ideally like to get this bug fixed and uplifted to 58 this week.

Can you only message strings? And it's too expensive to just message the data: URL?

Elaborating on Anne's comment, I presume the problem is that <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/713f2e3fbeefcaaecba634515184d00029c69d89/addon/webextension/blobConverters.js#L11> does new Blob() in a content script, and the Blob is coming from the content window global.
I think we want to add "Blob" and "File" to the wantGlobalProperties of the extension content script's sandbox at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2e08acdf8862e68b13166970e17809a3b5d6a555/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionContent.jsm#451> but this probably also wants webextensions to add a bunch more tests.

If you can message the actual Blob object and only create a URL from it at the point of download, there should be no problem. Blob objects by themselves don't carry an origin (principal if you will), those only get associated with blob: URLs.

|  | |

Ah, whoops, right.
Then the mis-match here probably is the situation where "Never Remember History" is really "always use private browsing mode" which means that the extension's background page principal will end up having an mPrivateBrowsingId > 0 but the download is using the system principal[1] and the system principal has mPrivateBrowsingId == 0. And so the new error case will fire because IsOriginAttributesEqualIgnoringFPD will fail because it doesn't special case for the system principal.
Or at least I think we haven't fixed the extension background page private browsing id issue...

Yes, thanks for the responses. I'll experiment with actually creating the URL inside the background window.
It seems odd to me that downloads \*do\* currently work in private browsing mode.

As I read <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/58c82fb9fa151f7db4a094fe9bd5eb85741a7acd/addon/webextension/background/main.js#L227>, you're already doing that and this is a function of the originattributes for the background window having an mPrivateBrowsingId > 0.

What type of download are you referring to? Normal file downloads are handled by the nsExternalHelperAppService[1] creating a DownloadLegacyTransfer[2] by way of it implementing nsITransfer[3]. In that case the channel is already opened by the uriloader which "diverts" the channel to the external helper app stuff in the parent. Compare with the screenshot extension which uses the Downloads.jsm API via the webext downloads API to explicitly trigger a download which I believe uses the DownloadCopySaver[4] which takes on the responsibility of opening the channel and decides to do it with the system principal, rather than the relevant docshell (which would inherently be associated with the principal that minted the URL via createObjectUrl).

As I understand it, this is already happening and most of our problem[1]. Unless it's been corrected, I believe the webextensions' background windows end up with private browsing flags set on their docshell. Okay, and yeah, I just ran a nightly build under linux with "never remember history" and attached gdb and it agrees with me[1]. Also if I set a breakpoint at <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b2e989b32e54#l1.58> we see it's a private browsing flag mismatch[2]

And to propose a short-term fix, we probably want to avoid the originattributes equality check if the aLoadInfo's principal is the system principal. I'll quickly create a patch and test it and ask baku to review/handle from there.

(fixing assignee... I keep forgetting bzexport does that and it doesn't honor my .hgrc)
We should probably add an explicit test that covers the downloads API, possibly as exposed by the webextensions API, downloading a blob url minted in an origin that will not match up with the system principal. This would likely take the form of a test where we use a content page that's in a container or private browsing mode, have it perform a createObjectUrl, and have the webextension pass that URL to the downloads API. Unless we think the webextensions API should explicitly forbid that use-case.Assignee: bugmail → amarchesini

sec-wise, I landed the fix per discussion with baku and the clean try run, and consistent with the decision in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1421099#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - blob URLs do not respect OriginAttributes segregation") to land the original fix which this regression fix amends.

This patch fixes the bug in Screenshots. Is there good reason to still update Screenshots to pass around a blob, not a blob URL?

I'd say it's generally cleaner to pass around objects. Especially since if you pass on a string you don't know when to revoke it (basically manual memory management).

System principal does not need to match originAttributes
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
This bug, the patch already uplifted to beta.
[User impact if declined]:
The webext Downloads API will fail to download URLs created via createObjectURL() that originate in a page context whose originattributes aren't the same as those used by the system principal. This means private browsing pages and user container pages. Because of weird fallout from the "always use private browsing"/"never remember history" preference surfaced in our preferences UI, the built-in Firefox Screenshots extension thing breaks when that is enabled. It's also likely other webexts can break even without that preference enabled if they are using createObjectURL from within a content script.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Not for this specific edge case, but we have test coverage that ensures the world won't break.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
By me, locally.
The fix has been in nightly since the 20171207220423 build.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
This was found by QE in <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3886> and probably wants QE to re-verify. I'm going to comment on that issue again to ask for a verification.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
No.
[Is the change risky?]:
No.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
It's just a system principal check and the check explicitly handles edge-cases to a null principal being provided.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.

> This patch fixes the bug in Screenshots. Is there good reason to still
> update Screenshots to pass around a blob, not a blob URL?
For clarity, I believe a data URL is being passed around, if we're talking about this code path:
<https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/41e27fd2567743f7067fd3d3649df8203f05f978/addon/webextension/selector/shooter.js#L194>
And here's where it goes from data URL to Blob and then Blob URL that gets downloaded:
<https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/58c82fb9fa151f7db4a094fe9bd5eb85741a7acd/addon/webextension/background/main.js#L226,L241>
aside: I was confused about this previously and thought the Blob was being directly passed because I confused the "takeShot" code path, which does send a Blob, with the "downloadShot" path, which does not, and is the actual thing we're talking about.
Double-aside: The use of data URLs instead of blobs is understandable given that IndexedDB is inoperable for webexts for the "never remember history" snafu we're dealing with here. But it is sad, Blobs rock! :)

System principal does not need to match originAttributes
might have been cleaner to do the followup in a separate bug, but let's get this new patch in beta so things are consistent.
