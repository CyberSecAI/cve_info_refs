Jonathan: will [bug 1370497](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") (spoofy combining marks) address this one, too?
Also like the Arabic character that inspired that bug, the mark in this bug is below the bottom of the text box we show in the Address Bar, although it looks like there ought to be enough whitespace to have shown it. Should that be filed as a separate UX bug? On Mac, anyway, it looks like a normal 'e' with space after it, but if you copy-paste it elsewhere you'll see the dot/ring thing that's below the e further down than the 'g' descender goes (the display box seems to stop at or maybe a pixel below the 'g' descender).Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs)

Since the combining marks are certainly a dupe of [bug 1370497](/show_bug.cgi?id=1370497 "RESOLVED FIXED - URL spoofing using combining marks") maybe we should morph this bug into one to cover us not showing the full height required for some characters/combinations.

AFAICS, it should do. These marks have Script=Tibetan, so the patch there will reject them (i.e. force punycode display) if they're applied to Latin letters.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

They're not actually blank in any of the Mac fonts (at least on my 10.12 system), which was the issue with several other Tibetan characters in [bug 1390980](/show_bug.cgi?id=1390980 "RESOLVED FIXED - Domain spoofing thanks to U+0F8C rendered as 'space' on Mac OS 10.11"). But as Dan notes, they are sufficiently low down that they are clipped (or largely clipped -- see the residual dots in the "blank" space in [attachment 8912018](/attachment.cgi?id=8912018 "Screen Shot 2017-09-25 at 22.48.44.png") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=8912018&action=edit "Screen Shot 2017-09-25 at 22.48.44.png")) from the URL bar field, although they show in the tab title.

The line-height of the <html:input> at the heart of the urlbar is set to `inherit` which inherits `-moz-use-system-font`. Why is that not sufficient to display the entirety of the text? (Changing it to e.g. 1.6em seems like it might help, but...)
Do we clip these on Windows/Linux as well? Or only on OSX?Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(jfkthame)

Because we're seeing characters that aren't supported by the system font (SFNS Text), so font fallback comes into play, and is finding large-repertoire CJK fonts where some of these characters are positioned significantly lower than the metrics of the system font would allow for.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

So, we can compensate for the characters in question with a simple CSS fix, I think, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient if other such characters appear, because I assume that, in principle, there is no limit to how tall the characters will be. Is that right?
I don't see any overflow set on the input or its descendants or its ancestors, so I can only assume that things being cut off is the result of layout treating HTML <input> things "specially", so I doubt we can do anything about that...

There's a property "overflow: -moz-hidden-unscrollable" in urlbar-searchbar.inc.css, which I think has some relevance here, but AFAICT just changing this (e.g. to visible) is not sufficient to solve things here. It does mean you can drag-scroll the content of the URL-bar upwards to see the low marks, but I don't think we really want that result anyhow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This seems reasonable to me, and certainly helps, but I'm not really a valid reviewer for front-end stuff.
FWIW, in my testing setting a line-height of 1.7em causes a \*very\* slight shift of the text baseline in the URL bar, though it's too slight to matter, I expect. But you might want to consider 1.67em, which AFAICS causes no visible shift at all. (With current system fonts on 10.12; of course, font changes in future OS versions might affect this.)

I don't think so. That's applied on the <xul:textbox/>, but text already can't overflow the anonymous <html:input/>.

That's true, but it seems unlikely things will get much worse than this. Note that we're only dealing with the system fonts that may get used as a result of fallback for obscure characters; we don't have to worry about a malicious site deploying a webfont with extremely high or low glyphs, as they won't be used in the URL bar anyhow.

Right, I tried removing this or replacing with an explicit overflow:visible, and that had no effect.

Yep, this is why I also asked Dão for a review. I wanted both of your opinions. :-)

Right, I noticed this, but I didn't think it was a big deal, effectively. The overall size of the urlbar is unchanged, as far as I can see, and the identity block text is shifted in the same way so the alignment doesn't really change, either.
When using 1.67em, there is indeed no shift but these characters are also slightly cut-off at the bottom still. I guess the question is how important that is, and I don't speak Tibetan, nor do I know if there are other languages that would be implicated here, so I don't know how to determine that.

I do notice that now, it no longer seems to be the case that the EV label moves, so if we do this only on mac, I guess we have to apply the same line-height to the EV label.

Mac-specific patch works for me. It makes me a bit nervous that this can affect the location bar height at all, but I suppose that's only a hypothetical concern on Mac. I also wonder if this affects the vertical text alignment. Have you checked that normal URLs (no Tibetan characters) are positioned as before?Flags: needinfo?(dao+bmo)

Attached patch

[Patch v0.2](attachment.cgi?id=8914308&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8914308&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1402368&attachment=8914308)

Tested on both compact and normal mode, this doesn't vertically shift the text or change the height of the urlbar. Confusingly, a slightly lower value of 1.7em does vertically shift the text (but doesn't change the height of the textbox), and then a slightly higher value puts it back. I assume there's a rounding issue somewhere, but given that this works I think it's OK. Note that the 1.745 value matches 24px (default font size is 11px but the urlbar gets font-size: 1.25em, so 13.75, and 24/13.75 is 1.745). I can also use 24px but I figured we should stick with em as that's what we use elsewhere.

Note that [bug 1399939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1399939 "VERIFIED FIXED - IDN script mixing policy: Consider switching to highly-restrictive") mitigates this by turning the IDN restrictions up to 'high' (you can test by simply flipping the pref back to "moderate", which works at runtime). I figure taking this is probably still a good idea to avoid not displaying certain text on OS X, or in case we have to back out the IDN restriction change if we run into web compact issues or something like that.

To be clear, this was a barely-observable shift of 1 device pixel (ie 0.5 css px) on a hidpi device, so it's not exactly earth-shattering, but hey.

Well, there are scripts where these characters are legitimate, so we're basically still cropping bits that we shouldn't. I don't know if that's a concern given the font thingymajig that's going on with this particular character vs. more "normal" text. Jonathan can hopefully answer that question more conclusively.Flags: needinfo?(gijskruitbosch+bugs) → needinfo?(jfkthame)

The location bar on OS X currently crops some legitimate diacritics, e.g. in Arabic, which could lead to ambiguity/spoofability for purely Arabic-script IDNs. As such, I think it's worth taking the patch here in order to reduce the risk of such clipping.Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

Note that as of v59, <input> no longer clips the text at the content edge
(in the vertical direction), but instead at the padding edge (by default).
So that should also give some more room to display text in the URL bar, IIUC.

Because of its severity rating, it did not qualify for a bounty (this happened in Dan's comment back in 2017.) The flag update I just performed was to ensure that your name does get added to our [Hall of Fame](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/hall-of-fame/) however.

Seems the crossorigin attribute is getting stripped somewhere/somehow. I don't know why, or if not stripping it would actually help given the weird stuff that about:reader does. :-\

Ha its actually kind of a security reason why this attribute is lost. Reader mode uses parserUtils to filter 'dangerous' attributes - I'm not familiar with the flags but from the looks of this line [1] my guess is that parserUtils.parseFragment is the culprit here. From testing:
var html = `<video src="<https://shhnjk.com/mov_bbb.mp4>" crossorigin='anonymous'=""></video>`
var parserUtils = Cc["@mozilla.org/parserutils;1"].getService(Ci.nsIParserUtils);
contentFragment = parserUtils.sanitize(html,Ci.nsIParserUtils.SanitizerDropForms | Ci.nsIParserUtils.SanitizerAllowStyle)
The resulting output is:
"<html><head></head><body><video src=\"<https://shhnjk.com/mov_bbb.mp4>\" controls=\"controls\"></video></body></html>"
Note that the crossorigin attribute is stripped.
So the obvious risk here is that an attacker crafts a malicious webpage, coerces user to open it in reader mode, and then use the CORS bypass to steal data. But reader blocks JavaScript, and I think also CSS, so its difficult for the page to ex-filtrate data. I can't think of a way that an attacker could abuse this this specific issue to steal data protected. So its probably a sec-low, unless there are more broad implications here (are there other security critical attributes that parserUtils strips?)

I feel like I'm missing something, but can anyone else come up with a scenario in which crossorigin='anonymous' is a security feature for a website?
parserUtils has a whitelist of tags and attributes, which indeed shouldn't contain crossorigin.
(If we needed it here (not sure), we could introduce a new flag for parserUtils and supply it in the sanitize() call)

Scenario:
Website wants to build a feature which displays a video with user supplied URL. But the page contains video can be viewed by any user in the website. Since HTTP video can be loaded to HTTPS websites, this website made sure to not to send user's cookie over HTTP by adding crossorigin='anonymous' (this will omit any credential to be sent with the request).
This scenario can be bypassed with Reader Mode.

Conversely though, as I understand it, when is crossorigin=anonymous ever something that parserutils needs to strip out? You suggested a flag, but it seems to me we should just fix parserutils so it doesn't strip out crossorigin=anonymous (though it should potentially strip out other values, I don't know).Flags: needinfo?(fbraun)

Seems like a pretty specific scenario (but then I guess its why crossorigin exists). I wonder if we have any telementry on its usage. In any case this scenario would seem to be just as much an issue of the website serving credentialed resources over HTTP (and/or setting sensitive cookies on HTTP schemed origins).

Yeah, but crossorigin=anonymous isn't really a mitigation for missing HTTPS. I share Paul's view that this is sec-low.

You're right, crossorigin could be on the whitelist of allowed attributes (regardless of its value, even), but I'm lacking context for most other uses of parserutils to know whether this holds true universally. Are you confident enough, or do you think we should investigate other usage?Flags: needinfo?(fbraun)

I manually applied crossorigin attribute on Reader Mode to see what happens, and it sends "Origin: null", so fix might not be that useful...

I don't know enough about the attribute to be confident in assessing the security implications of leaving/removing it in all circumstances.
Generally, from what I can tell, there are 3 effects:
1) the request includes may include various bits of information that could be considered "private" that either the embedding site or the browser is trying to protect. crossorigin=anonymous allows the embedding site to avoid sending cookies. crossorigin=use-credentials, on the other hand, could be used to force the browser to send stored credentials of some description which it wouldn't ordinarily do;
2) the request will be different, and so the server serving the request for the image/script/video could potentially respond differently;
3) the resource will behave differently within the embedding page, in terms of canvas tainting and onerror error information propagation.
This bug seems to be about the anonymous case for (1), and maybe (2) (though 2 isn't really a security issue).
In terms of the sanitizer, from reading <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/parser/html/nsIParserUtils.idl> I think we always strip script and anything script-ish, so it seems (3) shouldn't be a concern.
I can see theoretical cases where we ought to strip out use-credentials to avoid leaking of credentials -- except that because reader mode always uses an existing page, if someone were abusing `use-credentials` they would presumably just not (encourage the victim to) use reader mode...
From looking at <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=nsIParserUtils+-path%3Atest+-file%3AnsTreeSanitizer+-path%3Aobj-x86+-path%3Aparser%2Fhtml&redirect=false> we have 3 main uses of the sanitizer code:
1) reader mode (toolkit/components/reader/ ) and print's "simplify" mode (basically the same as reader mode) (toolkit/content/browser-content.js)
2) feed reader code (toolkit/components/feeds)
3) editor code sanitizing incoming paste/dnd data ( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/editor/libeditor/HTMLEditorDataTransfer.cpp#2167> )
For the first 2, keeping crossorigin=anonymous definitely seems correct to me. Again, less sure about crossorigin=use-credentials, but probably OK?
I'm hardly an editor expert, but I expect the same applies in that case - if the user copy/pastes code that has the attribute, we probably shouldn't be stripping it (and anyway, if this is a contenteditable the "receiving" site could just put it back).
The only other edgecase I can think of there is convincing a user to copy/paste or dnd HTML containing an image with the crossorigin attribute into a receiving target page for which the attacker does not know the URL, and the Origin CORS headers revealing the domain (even if the target page had set a meta referrer tag to avoid the referrer URL leaking for any requests). That seems pretty far-fetched as attacks go, though...
So the short answer is "I'm not sure, but leaning towards saying we could keep crossorigin=anonymous without a flag".

I though the threat model you're suggesting in [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute") revolves around cookies etc. being sent. Why would the origin header being null make that "not useful"?

FWIW, this would be fixed if we fixed [bug 1204818](/show_bug.cgi?id=1204818 "NEW - Move readerized content into a sandboxed iframe") in such a way that the document we frame has the principal of the original website.

I don't understand the security benefit in removing crossorigin attributes or what the attack vector would be. Exfiltration happens by creating requests, not by using CORS.

> I don't understand the security benefit in removing crossorigin attributes
The sanitizer removes everything that isn't on a list of "safe" things (which is arguably the \*safest\* way to build an HTML sanitizer in the face of an ever-changing web). When the crossorigin attribute was implemented, it was not added to the list of "safe" things at the time, so it's getting removed.
So it's less that I or anyone else is saying (or ever said) "we must remove this for security's sake", but that we're trying to establish whether/that this attribute is always safe and there's no possible way that keeping the attribute could affect user privacy or security, in all cases where this sanitizer is used, and so it must be kept. Given relative lack of familiarity with the attribute, I (and, it seems, others) are cautious. :-)

But exfiltration is not the only potential vector, and CORS vs. non-CORS requests, at least as far as I can tell, differ in what they reveal in an Origin header and/or credentials. I gave some examples in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute"):

If you, as someone who undoubtedly knows more about this attribute, thinks those aren't realistic vectors, and it's impossible for there to be any other ones, then sure, we can just add the attribute to the list of attributes the sanitizer should keep and move on. If all values are safe, it's going to be a 1-line patch...

Hmm okay. In any event, credentials also leak through <img> and similar such constructs. Origin leaks through Referer (couple minor exceptions, but if the page wants to leak the origin it can). So yeah, crossorigin is safe.

That's also true of the "integrity" attribute. We should probably not be stripping that out.

I filed [bug 1422519](/show_bug.cgi?id=1422519 "NEW - Images etc. requested in reader mode should include the original page host/uri in their Referer or Origin header") (non-sec-sensitive, because we already don't send a "Referer" header, either, and that doesn't seem sec-sensitive to me) to address this.

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.
