  "CVE-2018-5121": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is caused by the incomplete rendering of some Tibetan characters with low descenders in the Firefox address bar on macOS, which can lead to URL spoofing.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is how Firefox renders specific Tibetan characters with low descenders in the address bar on macOS. Due to font fallback and the use of CJK fonts, these characters are rendered lower than the address bar's display area, causing them to be clipped. This clipping can obscure the characters, leading to potential URL spoofing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete character rendering in the address bar",
      "Use of font fallback leading to incorrect display metrics",
      "Lack of proper line-height calculation for all character sets",
          "Insufficient height of the input box for displaying some character combinations"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that it allows for URL spoofing. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that appears to be a legitimate domain, tricking users into visiting a malicious website. This is done by using Tibetan characters that are rendered as a space or are clipped due to their low descenders, thereby hiding parts of the real URL.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing specific Tibetan characters U+0F37 and U+0F35. An attacker can create a malicious URL using these characters in a way that makes the URL appear legitimate, due to their visual rendering as spaces or clipping when displayed in the address bar on macOS.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a URL with specific Tibetan characters (U+0F37 and U+0F35) and needs a victim to use Firefox on a macOS system. The attacker also needs to convince the victim to visit the crafted URL."

  "CVE-2018-5119": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is that reader mode ignores the crossorigin attribute, loading cross-origin content even if CORS headers are set to prevent it.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the reader mode in Firefox uses `parserUtils` to sanitize HTML content, which strips the `crossorigin` attribute. This sanitization process removes the security measure that prevents a website from loading resources from a different origin if it does not have proper CORS headers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ignoring `crossorigin` attribute in reader mode",
      "Inadequate sanitization of HTML content by `parserUtils`",
          "Bypass of CORS policy in reader view"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that it can allow a malicious site to bypass the CORS restrictions by opening the page in reader view. This could allow access to content that should be restricted if the `crossorigin` attribute is respected. Specifically it can result in credentials being sent that the website intended to omit.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can create a malicious webpage containing a resource that should be blocked by CORS and then encourage a victim to open this webpage in Firefox's reader view. Because the reader view ignores the `crossorigin` attribute, it will load the cross-origin content, allowing the attacker to access a resource they would not be able to access under normal circumstances.",
        "required_capabilities":"The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage with resources that require CORS and be able to convince a user to open this page in Firefox reader view."
