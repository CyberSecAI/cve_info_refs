Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient session expiration within the Philips IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV) application. This occurs when ISCV is used in KIOSK mode with Windows authentication alongside an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613):** The ISCV application does not properly invalidate user sessions after use, allowing for potential reuse by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive patient information (ePHI) stored on the system.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could modify the accessed patient information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through local access to the affected system.
*   **KIOSK Mode:** The vulnerability is triggered when ISCV is running in KIOSK mode in conjunction with Windows Authentication and an EMR system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Skill Level:** An attacker with a low level of technical skill could exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access:**  The attacker needs local access to a machine running the vulnerable ISCV application in the described configuration.
*   **User Interaction**: A user must first log into the system before the attacker can reuse their session.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory states that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   Philips is releasing a software update for ISCV 3.1 to address the vulnerability with an additional configuration option to disable Windows authentication when in KIOSK mode with an EMR.
*   The advisory also includes standard mitigation advice such as network segmentation, firewall usage, and secure remote access methods.
