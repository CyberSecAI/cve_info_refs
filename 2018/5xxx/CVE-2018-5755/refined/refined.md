Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5755:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of spreadsheet formulas within the `readerengine` component of OX App Suite. Specifically crafted spreadsheets using ODS format could use functions that reference local files or read system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, where the application allows access to files and directories outside the intended scope. The spreadsheet formulas, like `=WEBSERVICE("file:///etc/passwd")`, `=CELL("filename")`, and `=INFO("system")`, can read arbitrary local files, including sensitive system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to read local files of the host running the `readerengine` component. This could expose sensitive information like configuration files with potential passwords. Additionally, attackers can gather internal system details, such as the operating system, paths, and patch levels, which can help in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to create a malicious ODS spreadsheet with specific formulas that reference local files or read system information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload or deliver a malicious ODS spreadsheet to a user of OX App Suite. The user would then need to open this file, triggering the vulnerability.
- The attacker requires low privileges within the system to trigger the vulnerability. This is described in the CVSS vector as "PR:L" (Low privileges).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specifically within the `readerengine` component of OX App Suite.
- The fix involved filtering ODS and OOXML function content against a blacklist.
- The vulnerability was confirmed and fixed by the vendor in versions 7.6.3-rev3, 7.8.2-rev4, 7.8.3-rev5, and 7.8.4-rev4.
- The CVSS score is 7.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).
