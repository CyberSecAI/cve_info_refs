Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-5119:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The reader view in Firefox was not respecting the `crossorigin` attribute of HTML elements. Specifically, the reader view's sanitization process was stripping the `crossorigin` attribute. This allowed the reader view to load cross-origin content regardless of the CORS headers set to prevent such loading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CORS bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that the reader view ignored the `crossorigin` attribute, effectively bypassing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. This means that content from different origins (domains) could be loaded even when CORS policies should prevent it.
- **Insecure sanitization:** The sanitization process within the reader view was not treating the crossorigin attribute as safe, and was stripping it from the HTML, thus creating the issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data leakage:** By bypassing CORS, a malicious page could potentially load resources from other domains that are meant to be protected by CORS policies. This could lead to unauthorized access to data that should be restricted.  While Javascript and CSS are blocked in Reader View, other types of data might still be loaded, therefore information may be leaked.
- **Credential leakage (potentially):** Although not the primary issue (as Reader View always send `Origin: null`), the `crossorigin` attribute can affect what headers/cookies are sent during a resource request. The lack of the attribute in Reader View can lead to cookies being sent, where they should not have been.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious website could use the reader mode to load cross-origin content, bypassing CORS restrictions, to potentially steal information.
- The user would have to open a crafted page in reader view for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attacker must host or control a website with crafted content.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to open the malicious website in reader mode.
- **Understanding of CORS bypass:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the CORS bypass issue.

**Additional notes:**
- This is considered a **low severity** vulnerability as per the content provided.
- The main fix was to include `crossorigin` to the list of "safe" attributes that should not be stripped by the sanitizer.
- The vulnerability was resolved by modifying the sanitizer to whitelist the `crossorigin` attribute.
- A separate issue to add correct `Referer` and `Origin` headers in Reader View was tracked under Bug 1422519
