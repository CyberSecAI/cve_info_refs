In 1393924 we introduced functionality to pull images references from meta tags, so that we show better screenshots on the newtab page. I'm not sure if the screenshot code is new or existing, but as a consequence, web pages can the content process to attempt a load of a local file. Luckily the sandbox stops the load, but it seems bad that the load is even attempted.
STR:
Create a page with a tag like:
<meta name="twitter:image" content="file:///Users/paul/Pictures/dog.jpg">
Expected results: nothing loads
Actual results:
Error message observable in system console:
getScreenshot error: Error: page-thumbnail:error
After turning on sandbox logging (set security.sandbox.logging.enabled to true), I noticed the content process failing to access a file, using OSX console:
"SandboxViolation: plugin-container(39465) deny file-read-metadata /Users/paul/Pictures/dog.jpg"
The code in ContentMetaHandler[1] doesnt seem to do any validation of the data pulled out of the content page. That sounds dangerous to me, but Im not sure if the expectation is that sanitzation/validation happens later.
[1] <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm#74>
== Impact==
Allowing web pages to coerce chrome privileged requests (I assume this is chrome privileged since the file load occurs) is dangerous. I don't \_think\_ there is any way to exploit this directly since a) the content doesnt come back to the web and b) sandboxing adds a layer of defense. But not fixing this seems like it would be asking for future trouble if this bug could be chained with something else.

Places stores all sorts of uri specs including file: place: about: schemes, so it might be acceptable to store potentially unused file: preview\_image\_url entries (where either activity stream or the thumbnailer decides not to use)
The saving of the file uri as preview\_image\_url to places happens before an attempt to thumbnail it, but not all preview\_image\_url entries result in a thumbnail request which would happen at some later time from some other content process.

I think the defense-in-depth solution here would be:
- add a checkloaduri check in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/33c90c196bc405e628bc868a4f4ba29b992478c0/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm#98-105> , and ignore tags that have URLs that the webpage shouldn't be allowed to link to.
- in AS / thumbnailer where we read/load preview\_image\_url entries, ensure that the request has the correct triggering/loadingPrincipal, such that gecko/necko/caps automatically says "no" a second time.
But we really ought to do at least one of these. file: things are sandboxed, but chrome: (and moz-icon: and ...) things are not, and just allowing any old request might well bite us at some point, even if right now, all we do is try to load it in an image element or as a background-image element.

We do have [Bug 1397800](/show_bug.cgi?id=1397800 "NEW - Be smarter about handling malformed meta tags") on our radar about being smarter when handling meta tags. We could potentially do this work there as well as a bunch of other stuff to gracefully handle these kinds of cases

Sounds good Ursula - is this 1397800 already prioritized? If not it, could I ask that it be considered as soon as possible. Frederik Braun pointed out that one tangible attack here is to inject a UNC network path ( \\machine\share\ ). This could be potential used to induce the victims machine to connect remotely over an insecure protocol (e.g. SMB) and enable a number of attacks. Marking as sec-high for this reason.
Its also possible that this bug is the cause of [bug 1419790](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419790 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - User's browsing history from other tabs/highlights is exposed in Google Analytics via twitter:image tag used by Highlights"), which is why I was looking at this code in the first place.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)See Also: → [1419790](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419790 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - User's browsing history from other tabs/highlights is exposed in Google Analytics via twitter:image tag used by Highlights")

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The use of checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal looks great. However, I do have some other comments, see below.
Note that as a sec-high, the tests would have to land separately and you'll need sec-approval before landing this (once it has r+ etc.)
Are you still planning to also pass a principal to the loadURI call inside the thumbnailer code? Did you run into issues with that that I could help with? (Only) When it comes to security, I'm partial to a belt + braces approach...

Nit: you can add this specifically to the test where you use a particular file. This makes it easier to (re)move tests if that's ever necessary. So:
[browser\_bad\_meta\_tags.js]
support-files = bad\_meta\_tags.html

So, bizarre protocols are allowed (hence the twitter:image example in the browser\_bad\_meta\_tags.js).
Would you be opposed to enforcing the target URL must be an http/https URI? If that sounds OK, you could modify this method to take a URL object and, before calling checkLoadURIStrWithPrincipal, doing something like:
if (!["http:", "https:"].includes(urlObj.protocol)) { return false }

This looks safe, but I'm interested know why we use null principal here.

Is this the correct principal? I was expecting that we would use the page's principal here. Are we using null principal, because at this point we don't have access to the actual principal of the page which contained the meta tag? I guess that is OK - but I think this will be more restrictive, than if we passed the page's principal - I wonder if this will break the feature?

Just a note re: the sec-high here - that may actually be a bit overrated, but I was being conservative because:
- this bug allows a webpage to trigger a file load
- I \_think\_ this could be used with a UNC path to cause the user make an insecure load EXCEPT that
- our sandbox blocks this (at least on OSX)
The reason why I marked this high, despite the sandbox, is that read access isn't totally locked down on windows, and I don't know how the windows sandbox interacts with UNC paths (what integrity would they get? Something I need to test...). If it is even possible i think it would actually be very difficult to exploit, but I'm just being cautious, especially since the fix is relatively straightforward.
TLDR: Al, when you are looking at sec-approval I don't think we have to be TOO cautious about this, and also I think its pretty unlikely that this would be exploited, so I wouldn't suggest we rush a fix out for this. (But happy to be overruled if Im missing an attack vector here).

Yeah, this is more restrictive. We do actually have the original principal, I think, from the meta tag's nodePrincipal (in the caller of this utility method, so we could pass it in). Anyone can link to http/https images, I think, including null principals, so I think being more restrictive is OK? We could use the node principal if that seems preferable.

No, totally agree with more restrictive, just wanted to make sure I understood the decision, thanks.

I can do that as well, I thought I could do that in a separate patch that I could test, mostly to keep this one contained in the metadata parsing module. Does that sound ok?

This was just the easiest way to test if it got the correct content for the tag it parsed. Technically new URL("twitter:image") is actually valid so checking the href on it works for the sake of the test.

I'd just split out the test changes to a separate patch and attach it separately, then consult with the security team about when to land.

OK, so, um, it would have been a good idea to read <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> . Please don't push patches like this to try (which is public), certainly not patches that have full descriptions of what the issue is. People watch our checkins, especially for sec bugs landing. :-(

This is a good idea. I think in our new lando/phabricator world, we'll have a private place for sec patches, so hopefully/maybe also a private try repo? X-ref [bug 1136954](/show_bug.cgi?id=1136954 "NEW - Build a private/hidden try server for security sensitive bug testing"). I would support having a push hook in the interim, though. I'll file a bug.

Right, sorry for not bringing it up earlier, and for the tone of [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs") - I should have been more constructive. :-(
I thought this page used to be linked from the sec-approval request template that you filled in, but I must have imagined that, and I don't remember how else I would have found out about it, it's been too long.
As Paul said in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs"), so far we don't have a concretely exploitable thing because the sandbox saves our ..., so I hope/assume we'll be OK.

Ahhhh. I did spend some time looking for this warning and didn't see it anywhere. I'm glad I'm not entirely crazy (though it's sad it doesn't appear consistently).

sec-approval+ for trunk for the patch \*without\* any tests. Do NOT check in tests into mozilla-central. Tests need to not be checked in until well after we ship Firefox 58 with this fix. This is so we don't 0day ourselves anymore than we may already have.
Let's get the patch nominated for beta as well so we fix it everywhere.

1420049.patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: [bug 1393924](/show_bug.cgi?id=1393924 "RESOLVED FIXED - Collect description and preview image and store it into moz_places")
[User impact if declined]: potential to read files (stopped by sandbox in e10s, but not otherwise)
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: generally yes. For this specific issue, there are tests but we won't land them until this is released because it's a sec-high sec bug.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Probably good given lack of automated testing in the tree right now. See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Activity Stream screenshots can be coerced to (attempt to) load File:// URIs"). After setting security.sandbox.logging.enabled to true, it should be possible to verify that prior to the patch, sandbox errors are logged (if e10s is enabled). After the patch, there should be no sandbox errors for the file embedded in the page that AS is loading.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: n/a
[Is the change risky?]: not really
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: adding necessary security checks to some utility code. This shouldn't affect well-meaning webpages, ever.
[String changes made/needed]: none.

Personally, I think it would be easier to track the tests in a separate bug, because the target milestone and per-release affected/fixed/verified flags are going to be more sane (rather than either being wrong for the patch or wrong for the tests). Up to you though, you're the bug assignee. If we want to leave this open, we can do, but then we may need to chase people for uplift requests.

Lowering the severity a bit. Attacking page can trigger activity stream to attempt loading a URL, but the content of that URL doesn't get passed back to the page. There's no same-origin information leak, even if the file: did get loaded. A bigger worry to me is if some chrome: url or moz-extension: url (assuming you can guess the UUID; currently possible in some cases) performs some action that would be dangerous just by loading it (not necessarily rendering it). I can't think of any off-hand, but some legacy extensions had security bugs by exposing custom protocol handlers so it's not out of the question. Maybe that's already protected against on the Activity Stream side? Probably not because if we were loading file: urls (without the sandbox) then we weren't calling checkLoadURI and I'm not sure what else would filter out chrome:.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Reporter
Alex Gaynor

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

Seems the crossorigin attribute is getting stripped somewhere/somehow. I don't know why, or if not stripping it would actually help given the weird stuff that about:reader does. :-\

Ha its actually kind of a security reason why this attribute is lost. Reader mode uses parserUtils to filter 'dangerous' attributes - I'm not familiar with the flags but from the looks of this line [1] my guess is that parserUtils.parseFragment is the culprit here. From testing:
var html = `<video src="<https://shhnjk.com/mov_bbb.mp4>" crossorigin='anonymous'=""></video>`
var parserUtils = Cc["@mozilla.org/parserutils;1"].getService(Ci.nsIParserUtils);
contentFragment = parserUtils.sanitize(html,Ci.nsIParserUtils.SanitizerDropForms | Ci.nsIParserUtils.SanitizerAllowStyle)
The resulting output is:
"<html><head></head><body><video src=\"<https://shhnjk.com/mov_bbb.mp4>\" controls=\"controls\"></video></body></html>"
Note that the crossorigin attribute is stripped.
So the obvious risk here is that an attacker crafts a malicious webpage, coerces user to open it in reader mode, and then use the CORS bypass to steal data. But reader blocks JavaScript, and I think also CSS, so its difficult for the page to ex-filtrate data. I can't think of a way that an attacker could abuse this this specific issue to steal data protected. So its probably a sec-low, unless there are more broad implications here (are there other security critical attributes that parserUtils strips?)

I feel like I'm missing something, but can anyone else come up with a scenario in which crossorigin='anonymous' is a security feature for a website?
parserUtils has a whitelist of tags and attributes, which indeed shouldn't contain crossorigin.
(If we needed it here (not sure), we could introduce a new flag for parserUtils and supply it in the sanitize() call)

Scenario:
Website wants to build a feature which displays a video with user supplied URL. But the page contains video can be viewed by any user in the website. Since HTTP video can be loaded to HTTPS websites, this website made sure to not to send user's cookie over HTTP by adding crossorigin='anonymous' (this will omit any credential to be sent with the request).
This scenario can be bypassed with Reader Mode.

Conversely though, as I understand it, when is crossorigin=anonymous ever something that parserutils needs to strip out? You suggested a flag, but it seems to me we should just fix parserutils so it doesn't strip out crossorigin=anonymous (though it should potentially strip out other values, I don't know).Flags: needinfo?(fbraun)

Seems like a pretty specific scenario (but then I guess its why crossorigin exists). I wonder if we have any telementry on its usage. In any case this scenario would seem to be just as much an issue of the website serving credentialed resources over HTTP (and/or setting sensitive cookies on HTTP schemed origins).

You're right, crossorigin could be on the whitelist of allowed attributes (regardless of its value, even), but I'm lacking context for most other uses of parserutils to know whether this holds true universally.

I don't know enough about the attribute to be confident in assessing the security implications of leaving/removing it in all circumstances.
Generally, from what I can tell, there are 3 effects:
1) the request includes may include various bits of information that could be considered "private" that either the embedding site or the browser is trying to protect. crossorigin=anonymous allows the embedding site to avoid sending cookies. crossorigin=use-credentials, on the other hand, could be used to force the browser to send stored credentials of some description which it wouldn't ordinarily do;
2) the request will be different, and so the server serving the request for the image/script/video could potentially respond differently;
3) the resource will behave differently within the embedding page, in terms of canvas tainting and onerror error information propagation.
This bug seems to be about the anonymous case for (1), and maybe (2) (though 2 isn't really a security issue).
In terms of the sanitizer, from reading <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/parser/html/nsIParserUtils.idl> I think we always strip script and anything script-ish, so it seems (3) shouldn't be a concern.
I can see theoretical cases where we ought to strip out use-credentials to avoid leaking of credentials -- except that because reader mode always uses an existing page, if someone were abusing `use-credentials` they would presumably just not (encourage the victim to) use reader mode...
From looking at <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=nsIParserUtils+-path%3Atest+-file%3AnsTreeSanitizer+-path%3Aobj-x86+-path%3Aparser%2Fhtml&redirect=false> we have 3 main uses of the sanitizer code:
1) reader mode (toolkit/components/reader/ ) and print's "simplify" mode (basically the same as reader mode) (toolkit/content/browser-content.js)
2) feed reader code (toolkit/components/feeds)
3) editor code sanitizing incoming paste/dnd data ( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/editor/libeditor/HTMLEditorDataTransfer.cpp#2167> )
For the first 2, keeping crossorigin=anonymous definitely seems correct to me. Again, less sure about crossorigin=use-credentials, but probably OK?
I'm hardly an editor expert, but I expect the same applies in that case - if the user copy/pastes code that has the attribute, we probably shouldn't be stripping it (and anyway, if this is a contenteditable the "receiving" site could just put it back).
The only other edgecase I can think of there is convincing a user to copy/paste or dnd HTML containing an image with the crossorigin attribute into a receiving target page for which the attacker does not know the URL, and the Origin CORS headers revealing the domain (even if the target page had set a meta referrer tag to avoid the referrer URL leaking for any requests). That seems pretty far-fetched as attacks go, though...
So the short answer is "I'm not sure, but leaning towards saying we could keep crossorigin=anonymous without a flag".

I though the threat model you're suggesting in [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute") revolves around cookies etc. being sent. Why would the origin header being null make that "not useful"?

There's no scenario in which use-credentials makes the browser send stored credentials that it wouldn't send if there was no crossorigin attribute at all (well, there is <script type=module>, but that's disallowed anyway)

The sanitizer removes everything that isn't on a list of "safe" things (which is arguably the \*safest\* way to build an HTML sanitizer in the face of an ever-changing web). When the crossorigin attribute was implemented, it was not added to the list of "safe" things at the time, so it's getting removed.
So it's less that I or anyone else is saying (or ever said) "we must remove this for security's sake", but that we're trying to establish whether/that this attribute is always safe and there's no possible way that keeping the attribute could affect user privacy or security, in all cases where this sanitizer is used, and so it must be kept. Given relative lack of familiarity with the attribute, I (and, it seems, others) are cautious. :-)

But exfiltration is not the only potential vector, and CORS vs. non-CORS requests, at least as far as I can tell, differ in what they reveal in an Origin header and/or credentials. I gave some examples in [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute"):

If you, as someone who undoubtedly knows more about this attribute, thinks those aren't realistic vectors, and it's impossible for there to be any other ones, then sure, we can just add the attribute to the list of attributes the sanitizer should keep and move on. If all values are safe, it's going to be a 1-line patch...

Hmm okay. In any event, credentials also leak through <img> and similar such constructs. Origin leaks through Referer (couple minor exceptions, but if the page wants to leak the origin it can). So yeah, crossorigin is safe.

looks good to me!
Note that I'm not a DOM Security peer (and neither is pauljt), so you'll need another review.

That's also true of the "integrity" attribute. We should probably not be stripping that out.

Makes sense. I'll add that to the patch while we're here...

Patch
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: for some subresources in reader mode, we're not verifying integrity of and/or treating them as CORS requests, which in some very limited cases may cause security and/or privacy issues.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: reader mode as a whole is, this particular aspect of it is not.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Using the steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute"), check that the outgoing request for <https://shhnjk.com/mov_bbb.mp4> contains an "Origin" header.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: n/a
[Is the change risky?]: not too risky
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: it's a trivial patch, we have lots of beta runway still, and there was extensive discussion (with consensus) about whether this was the right thing to do.
[String changes made/needed]: n/a

(In reply to Jun from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader view ignores crossorigin attribute"))
> I manually applied crossorigin attribute on Reader Mode to see what happens,

I filed [bug 1422519](/show_bug.cgi?id=1422519 "NEW - Images etc. requested in reader mode should include the original page host/uri in their Referer or Origin header") (non-sec-sensitive, because we already don't send a "Referer" header, either, and that doesn't seem sec-sensitive to me) to address this.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one.

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
