Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol's main mode when using Pre-Shared Key (PSK) authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Offline Dictionary/Brute-Force Attack:** Unlike previously thought, IKEv1 main mode with PSK is susceptible to offline dictionary attacks. This means an attacker can capture network traffic and then try various PSKs to decrypt the data offline without needing to interact further with the victim.
*   **Vulnerability in Standard:** The weakness is present in the IKEv1 standard itself (RFC 2409), affecting any compliant implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Recovery of Weak PSK:** An attacker can recover the Pre-Shared Key if it is weak (e.g., a low-entropy password). This key can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the VPN or protected network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker needs to perform an active MitM attack during the IKEv1 handshake. The attacker intercepts the connection attempt and responds as the legitimate peer.
*   **Packet Capture:** The attacker must capture the IKEv1 handshake packets, including the session identifier, nonces, and Diffie-Hellman shared secret.
*   **Offline Computation:** The attacker then performs the dictionary attack offline to try and derive the correct PSK.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a network position to perform an active MitM attack on the IKEv1 handshake.
*   **Packet Capture:** The attacker needs the ability to capture network traffic containing the IKEv1 negotiation.
*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient resources to perform a dictionary or brute-force attack.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The attacker needs the session identifier, nonces, and the Diffie-Hellman shared secret (gxy), which are obtained during the MitM attack.
*   The attacker computes possible keys (k) using each password from their dictionary with the previously exchanged nonces.
*   Key derivation process using the values of the session identifiers and shared Diffie-Hellman secret is performed for each key (k), obtaining ka, kd and ke.
*   The attacker uses the derived key ke to decrypt the encrypted part of message 5 in the IKEv1 handshake. The decrypted IDI (typically the IP address of the initiator) can be used to determine if the correct PSK was guessed.

The provided blog post also mentions that although previously only aggressive mode was considered vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks, this research shows that main mode with PSK is also vulnerable using an active MITM attack. It also highlights that while using strong/complex passwords helps, it's important to move to stronger authentication methods and that this vulnerability applies to any standards-compliant system implementing IKEv1 main mode with PSK. The blog post also notes that the attack was previously described, but was not widely known.
