Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple PHP injection and malicious file upload vulnerabilities within the ShoreTel/Mitel Connect ONSITE ST 14.2 software. These vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Injection:** The application is susceptible to PHP injection, which allows an attacker to insert and execute arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The application allows the upload of malicious files, likely without proper validation or sanitization. This could allow for the injection of malicious code via file uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server in the context of the running service.
*   **Data Disclosure and Modification:** The attacker can potentially access and modify sensitive data stored on the system.
*   **System Availability Impact:** The attacker can disrupt the normal operation and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts (`/scripts/vsethost.php` and `/scripts/vmhost.php`).
*   **Parameter Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code within specific HTTP GET parameters, leveraging PHP injection vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ShoreTel/Mitel Connect ONSITE server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable PHP scripts and how to manipulate their parameters.
*   **Ability to craft malicious HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send HTTP requests containing the malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code is written in Ruby and demonstrates how to chain the vulnerabilities. It takes a base URL of the vulnerable application and a command as input and uses base64 to encode it. Then, it makes a GET request to the vulnerable `/scripts/vsethost.php` with the encoded command and parameters that trigger the PHP injection. Finally, it requests `/scripts/vmhost.php` to execute the injected code.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Mitel by Jared McLaren of SecureWorks in early 2018, but a public proof of concept was not released until this exploit.
*   Mitel has released a security advisory (18-0004) indicating that newer versions are not affected, recommending users update their software to the latest version.
*   The exploit has been tested on ShoreTel/Mitel Connect ONSITE ST 14.2, version 19.49.5200.0 and likely affects many prior and later versions.
