Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an uncontrolled recursive call between the `jsC_cexp` and `cbinary` functions within the MuJS Javascript interpreter. This recursion is triggered when processing a specially crafted Javascript file that contains a large number of nested function calls, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Recursion:** The `jsC_cexp` and `cbinary` functions call each other recursively without sufficient checks on the depth of the call stack.
- **Stack Overflow:** The deep recursion consumes stack memory, leading to a stack overflow when the stack limit is exceeded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, resulting in an application crash due to a stack overflow. This can render the application using the MuJS interpreter unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Javascript File:**  The attack vector is a specially crafted javascript file, which can be delivered to the vulnerable application.
- **File Processing:** The interpreter must process the malicious javascript file containing the long chain of nested function calls

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted Javascript file to a program using the vulnerable MuJS library.
- No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided bug report includes the stack trace of the crash with AddressSanitizer.
- The provided exploit is a simple poc:
  `python -c "print 'func%d'*80000" > poc.js`
  `mujs poc.js`
- The issue was fixed in commit `4d45a96e57fbabf00a7378b337d0ddcace6f38c1` with a guard against too much recursion in binary expressions.
- The provided poc.js file is a long string of calls to a function named "func", created via python.
