Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of remote content in S/MIME encrypted messages. Specifically, it's a chosen-ciphertext attack that can reveal plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Chosen-ciphertext attack:** By manipulating the ciphertext of an S/MIME message containing remote content, an attacker can force the decryption process to reveal portions of the plaintext.
*   **Plaintext disclosure:** Remote content within an encrypted message can be exploited to expose the message's plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full plaintext recovery:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to fully recover the plaintext of an encrypted S/MIME message.
*   **Sensitive information exposure:** This vulnerability can expose sensitive or confidential data contained within the encrypted email messages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote content in S/MIME messages:** The attack requires the presence of remote content (e.g., images or links) within an encrypted S/MIME email message.
*   **Chosen-ciphertext manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the ciphertext of the encrypted message and send it to the target user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to manipulate ciphertext:** The attacker must be able to modify the ciphertext of the S/MIME message before sending it to the victim.
*   **Knowledge of the encryption algorithm:** The attacker needs knowledge of the S/MIME encryption implementation.
*   **Target user receives manipulated message:** The attacker must be able to get the manipulated S/MIME message delivered to the targeted user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Several sources mention that scripting is disabled when reading mail in Thunderbird, but the vulnerability can be a risk in browser-like contexts.
*   The vulnerability was reported by multiple researchers: Damian Poddebniak, Christian Dresen, Jens Müller, Fabian Ising, Sebastian Schinzel, Simon Friedberger, Juraj Somorovsky, and Jörg Schwenk.
*   Multiple vendors have released patches for this vulnerability, including Mozilla (Thunderbird), Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat.
*   Red Hat classified the severity of the vulnerability as "Important" and the priority as "High".
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Thunderbird version 52.8 and later.
