- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in a service within the software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) allows a remote attacker to arbitrarily read/access system resources and affect the availability of the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker arbitrary read/write abilities on the system. This could lead to unauthorized access to system resources and impact the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction and can be remote. The attacker needs a low skill level to exploit the vulnerability.
