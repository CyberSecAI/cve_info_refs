# R7-2018-15 | CVE-2018-5553: Crestron DGE-100 Console Command Injection (FIXED)

* Jun 12, 2018
* 3 min read
* [Sam Huckins](/blog/author/sam-huckins/)

*Last updated at Mon, 22 Jan 2024 18:10:12 GMT*

This post describes CVE-2018-5553, a vulnerability in the Crestron Console service that is preinstalled on the DGE-100. Due to a lack of input sanitization, this service is vulnerable to command injection that can be used to gain root-level access. DGE-100 devices running firmware versions 1.3384.00049.001 and lower with default configuration are vulnerable to CVE-2018-5553.

CVE-2018-5553 is categorized as [CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html), and has a base CVSSv3 score of [9.8 (Critical)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Firmware version 1.3384.00059.001, released on June 4, 2018, patches CVE-2018-5553. Users should update their DGE-100 devices to the latest firmware version [available here](https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Products/Video/Video-Processors/Digital-Graphics-Engines/DGE-100).

## Product Description

The Crestron Digital Graphics Engine 100 (DGE-100), is a hardware controller used to connect a touchscreen interface (commonly, a Crestron TSD-2220 HD touchscreen display) to external sources over HDMI, USB, or Ethernet. More information about the device is available at the [vendor's website](https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Products/Video/Video-Processors/Digital-Graphics-Engines/DGE-100). The typical installation is a corporate meeting space or control room. Crestron Electronics distributes this device globally.

## Credit

This issue was discovered by Rapid7 researchers Cale Black and Jordan Larose. It is being disclosed in accordance [Rapid7's vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.rapid7.com/security/disclosure/).

## Exploitation Details

The product manual for the Crestron DGE-100 describes a “Crestron console” service listening on TCP port 41795, which requires “a proprietary management tool” to use. However, DGE-100 devices do not require credentials for administrative access to the console service by default.

By connecting to this service with netcat and using the `ping` command with an argument constructed of shell-expandable variables, it is possible to inject operating system commands that will be executed by this console, which itself runs as root. An example is shown below, where the device (at x.x.x.237) is induced to send the console service’s uid (root) to the attacker’s computer (at x.x.x.25), which is listening on port 80:

![Sending commands via ping](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2018/06/Figure-1.png)

![Receiving a response with the UID](https://blog.rapid7.com/content/images/2018/06/Figure-2.png)

## Impact

If default configuration is left in place (i.e. if credentials are not required for administrative access), anyone with the ability to connect to the device’s TCP port 41795 is effectively able to elevate to a root shell on the device. This would make it possible for attackers to co-opt the device for a persistent “beachhead” into the affected network, and launch attacks from an affected DGE-100.

Since root access offers unfettered access to the device’s core functionality, it is likely that attackers with this privileged position would be able to intercept and modify any data that the device handles, including the normal video or control data being served over the Ethernet, HDMI, or USB ports.

## Vendor Statement

> Security is a top priority at Crestron Electronics. We appreciate Rapid7’s efforts in identifying this vulnerability and responsibly sharing this information with Crestron. Crestron took immediate action upon receiving the information and has created updates to remediate this concern.

> Crestron has no evidence of any customers being impacted by this issue. If customers have configured their systems based on our [published security best practices](https://support.crestron.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/5571), then the risk is low as an authenticated user would be required to exploit this vulnerability.

## Remediation

Users should update their DGE-100 devices to the latest firmware version (1.3384.00059.001 or higher) [available here](https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Products/Video/Video-Processors/Digital-Graphics-Engines/DGE-100) (Crestron web account required) as soon as possible. This version was released on June 4, 2018 and patches CVE-2018-5553.

Additionally, users should ensure that server-side authentication is enabled on their DGE-1000 devices to control access to the console service. The steps to do this, as well as other configuration improvements to consider, are described in [this security guide](https://support.crestron.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/5571) (Crestron web account required) published by Crestron.

Users that are not able to limit access to the console service by enabling authentication should ensure that untrusted users cannot connect to the device via network ACLs and firewall rules.

The Crestron® [DGE‑100](https://www.crestron.com/model/6507101) digital graphics engine transforms an HD touch screen display into an advanced Crestron controller. The DGE‑100 features Smart Graphics® technology that may be used to create a custom graphical environment for controlling audio, video, lighting, shades, HVAC, security, and other amenities. The DGE‑100 can also be used for functions with dual-window video display, annotation, audio feedback, and web browsing. Its low‑profile, surface‑mountable design allows for a discreet installation behind a flat‑panel display, under a table, or inside a lectern or equipment rack.

The DGE‑100 features an HDMI® output for connecting to a display device, and includes a USB HID port for touch, mouse, or keyboard input. Additional control ports are provided for controlling the display device and other equipment. The HDMI input allows an AirMedia® wireless presentation gateway or other high‑definition video source to be connected and displayed on-screen. Additionally, H.264 streaming video signals can be received over a high-speed Ethernet connection, and Ethernet provides an interface to a Crestron control system.1

**Touch Screen Interface**

The DGE‑100 can be paired with the [TSD‑2220](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Control-Surfaces/Touch-Screens/Extra-Large-Touch-Screens/TSD-2220-B) HD touch screen display to deliver a high‑definition 21.5 in. touch screen control panel that is ideal for home, corporate, and government applications. The DGE‑100 is also compatible with third‑party touch screen displays to support a range of control, collaboration, video display, and interactive kiosk solutions.

**OSM Interface**

On-screen menu (OSM) capability offers an alternative to touch screen control, providing a fully-customizable control menu on a television or video display. The control menu is easily navigated via a [Crestron handheld remote](https://crestron.com/model/6508585) or a USB mouse. The DGE-100 delivers high‑resolution menu graphics that pop up unobtrusively at the edge of the screen alongside the video source. Control functions such as adjusting lighting or lowering shades can be easily performed without interrupting a television program or video stream. Detailed alert messages can be configured to display on‑screen for events such as security alarms or a doorbell ring, and a live‑streaming camera window can be accessed to check security cameras.

**Smart Graphics Technology**

Smart Graphics® technology enables programmers to integrate fluid gesture‑driven controls, animated feedback, rich metadata, embedded apps and widgets, and full-motion video into their user interfaces. Smart Graphics provides dynamic features such as graphical buttons and sliders, lists and toolbars, drag‑and‑drop objects, dashboard widgets, screensavers, and customizable themes.1

**HD Streaming Video**

The DGE‑100 supports high-definition streaming video, making it possible to view security cameras and other video sources over the network via the touch screen display. Native support for H.264 and MJPEG formats allows the DGE‑100 to display live streaming video from an IP camera, a streaming encoder ([DM‑TXRX‑100‑STR](https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Products/Video/DigitalMedia-Streaming-Solutions/Encoder-Decoders/DM-TXRX-100-STR) or similar), or a [DigitalMedia™ switcher](https://www.crestron.com/en-US/Products/Featured-Solutions/DigitalMedia-Matrix-Switchers).1

**HDMI Input**

An HDMI® input is provided for connecting and displaying an HD video source. Wireless presentation is also supported by connecting an [AirMedia® gateway](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Featured-Solutions/Airmedia) to the HDMI input, allowing for laptops and mobile devices to connect to the DGE‑100 over Wi‑Fi® communications.2

**HDCP Support**

Support for HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) ensures seamless compatibility with content-protected optical disc, television, and streaming sources.

**Web Browsing**

Using its built‑in web browser, the DGE‑100 provides access to online program guides and other web‑based services, and it can be used to control DVRs and other devices without having to pick up a separate tablet or smartphone.3

**Multitouch Support**

When paired with the TSD‑2220 or another multitouch compatible touch screen display, the DGE‑100 affords enhanced capabilities for browsing web pages using multitouch control.

**On-screen Keyboard**

Typing in passwords, URLs, and text searches is facilitated using the on‑screen multilanguage keyboard.

**Built-in Annotation**

Annotation helps to add another dimension to any presentation. Native to the DGE‑100, annotation provides the ability to capture ideas in real time, letting you draw and write over a video source or sketch out thoughts on a whiteboard screen.

Remote annotation capability allows multiple participants, each with a separate touch screen, to annotate over the same video image or whiteboard for enhanced collaboration. Remote annotation is possible by using multiple digital graphics engines and touch screens. Adding a dedicated DGE‑100 to the main display in a room allows the annotated session to be viewed by an entire audience.

**Onboard Control Ports**

The DGE‑100 provides built-in RS-232 and IR ports for programmable control of the connected display and other devices via a control system. When connected to a control system via Ethernet, the DGE‑100 offers a gateway for controlling the display device directly through its HDMI connection, which reduces the need for any dedicated serial cables or IR emitters. Additional control capabilities are available by using CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) that is embedded within the HDMI signal.

**Low-Profile Installation**

The DGE‑100 mounts conveniently to a wall, ceiling, or other flat surface. Its compact, surface‑mountable form factor fits easily behind a flat panel display, beneath a tabletop, or inside a lectern or other furniture. It can even be attached directly to a single rack rail in the back of an equipment cabinet. The DGE‑100 can be powered using the included wall mount power pack or via PoE (Power over Ethernet) for a true single‑wire solution.

**Enterprise Grade Security**

The DGE‑100 employs enterprise-grade networking with robust security features such as 802.1X authentication, TLS encryption, HTTPS connectivity, and Active Directory® service integration. These features help to protect your network and to ensure compliance with your organization’s network policies. Cloud‑based provisioning and management streamlines the process of configuring, monitoring, and updating each DGE‑100 on the network. Additional support for SNMP allows the DGE‑100 to be monitored by your IT administrator.

**XiO Cloud Service**

The DGE‑100 is compatible with the XiO Cloud® service, which is an IoT (Internet of Things) based platform for remotely provisioning, monitoring, and managing Crestron devices across an enterprise or an entire client base. Built on the Microsoft® Azure® software platform and utilizing Microsoft's industry‑leading Azure IoT Hub technology, XiO Cloud enables installers and IT managers to deploy and manage thousands of devices simultaneously. Unlike other virtual machine‑based cloud solutions, Azure services provide unlimited scalability to suit the ever‑growing needs of an enterprise.
