##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Posted on 14 November 2022

###### Functionality

Never had a form extension that works like this one. Many templates to choose from. Changeable picture....

###### Ease of use

Very easy to use, great lay-outs, everthing can be changed. Just install en start using

###### Support

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Free to use for basic forms, pro version is cheap. Great design.

I used this to:

#### [No Longer Supported](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/contacts-and-feedback/forms/form-maker/#rev-119033)

[michael (2).](/profile/profile/details/307464)

Posted on 10 February 2021

###### Functionality

Recent major issues being slow when saving a record. Used to take less than 10 sec now takes five times longer. No more support from company

###### Ease of use

Requires some time to figure out the structure of forms. Overall a 6 out of 10.

###### Support

The product for joomla is no longer being supported by the company, probably since 2018 or so.

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Used to be a good value. However, with it not being updated for 3 years, it probably is not worth the money unless for very simple forms.

I used this to:
Business to be able to update orders and have them viewable to the client under their account.

#### [Not Supported By Vendor](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/contacts-and-feedback/forms/form-maker/#rev-118246)

[antonin (1).](/profile/profile/details/525222)

Posted on 10 October 2020

###### Functionality

The forms built with this extension are not compatible with all mobile devices

###### Ease of use

Amazingly, one of the easier form builders to work with. It is less complicated than several others.

###### Support

The Joomla version of this extension is no longer supported by the vendor.

###### Documentation

###### Value for money

Now that it is no longer supported, value is questionable, since there is considerable risk.

I used this to:
Several different types of contact forms. We had plans for more.

#### [Used to be great, but they don't care anymore.](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/contacts-and-feedback/forms/form-maker/#rev-114310)

[Elba M. Martinez (5).](/profile/profile/details/33792)

Posted on 17 July 2019

###### Functionality

It works! Many ways to customize it and will work from the simplest to the most complex way. The multilanguage instructions don't work.

###### Ease of use

No programming involved at all. You can create complex forms without hassle or code knowledge.

###### Support

Awful! It's non existent. They shut down the forums and don't answer any message sent through their contact us page. Used to be great.

###### Documentation

I assume that the extension and documentation haven't been updated because some of the instructions don't work on today's Joomla version.

###### Value for money

They continue selling the extension even though there's no maintenance. They have moved to only WP plugins under another name. Not good.

I used this to:
Different customers need complex forms for their customers and resellers.

###### Functionality

Does what it say really easy, but the interface is a little bit old fashioned. Also some strings are always in English.

###### Ease of use

Really easy and understandable

###### Value for money

I used the free version so as long as it has a free version its OK.

I needed something swiftly to create a complicated booking form.

###### Ease of use

Went to the demo version online and built the form in minutes rather than hours, brilliant, would it be so good in situ? YES.

###### Support

I messed up, filling in things I need not have bothered with. Support wasn't needed in the end, just to go over the documentation.

###### Documentation

Good! One issue, I'd to change my Joomla Global Config to SMTP mail rather than PHP due to a instantiate mail function error. Easy fix.

###### Value for money

If I was still working full time in Joomla I'd add it to my library of plugins. Must try the WordPress version.

I used this to:
Building forms?
