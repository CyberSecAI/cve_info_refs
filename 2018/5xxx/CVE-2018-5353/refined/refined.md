      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The custom GINA/CP module in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus does not authenticate the intended server before opening a browser window, allowing a spoofing attack to redirect the browser to gain execution in the context of the WinLogon.exe process.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inadequate server authentication",
          "Lack of proper input validation",
          "Improper access control"

        "attackVectors": [
          "Spoofing attacks (ARP, physical access, etc.)",
          "Redirecting the browser window opened by GINA/CP module to an attacker-controlled server",

        "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker capable of network spoofing or physical access to the target system.",
