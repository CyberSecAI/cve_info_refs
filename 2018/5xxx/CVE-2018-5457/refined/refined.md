- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path element vulnerability in Vyaire Medical's CareFusion Upgrade Utility application. The application loads DLLs without properly validating their location, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to CWE-427, Uncontrolled Search Path Element. This means that the application searches for DLL files in an uncontrolled manner.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to insert a malicious DLL on the target system and execute arbitrary code with the same privilege level as the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector requires local access. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the system and the ability to place a malicious DLL file on it. The user needs to interact with the application for the malicious DLL to be loaded. This can be through some form of social engineering to get the user to run the malicious DLL.
