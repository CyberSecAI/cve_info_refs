## TP-Link EAP Controller lacks RMI authentication and is vulnerable to deserialization attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#581311

Original Release Date: 2018-09-26 | Last Revised: 2018-11-08

---

### Overview

The TP-LINK EAP Controller is TP-LINK's software for remotely controlling wireless access point devices. EAP Controller for Linux lacks user authentication for RMI service commands, as well as utilizes an outdated vulnerable version of Apache commons-collections, which may allow an attacker to implement deserialization attacks and control the EAP Controller server.

### Description

| [**CWE-306**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function -** CVE-2018-5393EAP Controller for Linux utilizes a Java remote method invocation (RMI) service for remote control. The RMI interface does not require any authentication before use. Remote attackers can implement deserialization attacks through the RMI protocol. Successful attacks may allow a remote attacker to remotely control the target server and execute Java functions or bytecode.[**CWE-502**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data -** CVE-2015-6420 EAP Controller for Linux bundles a vulnerable version of Apache commons-collections v3.2.1 with the software, which appears to be the root cause of the vulnerability. Therefore, EAP Controller v2.5.3 and earlier are vulnerable to CVE-2015-6420 as documented in [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313).EAP Controller v2.5.3 and earlier for Linux are affected by both vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A Java application or library with the Apache Commons Collections library in its classpath may be coerced into executing arbitrary Java functions or bytecode. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The Omada Controller software v3.0.2 and later are not affected by this issue. Software download is available on the TP-Link [support](https://www.tp-link.com/en/support.html) website. If older software must be used, users can help mitigate and reduce risk by updating the vulnerable libraries does not necessarily eliminate the vulnerability in all scenarios, as described in As described in [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313). |
| --- |

| **Update Apache commons-collections**Affected users should update the system Apache commons-collections library to at least version 3.2.2 or 4.1. For details, please see [VU#576313](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/576313).**Update the JRE version of EAP**Affected users should also update the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by EAP to the latest available version. Recent versions of JRE have improved deserialization protection features. |
