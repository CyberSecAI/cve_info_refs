Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TP-Link EAP Controller for Linux uses a Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service for remote control, and this service lacks authentication.
*   The software bundles a vulnerable version of Apache Commons Collections (v3.2.1)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** The RMI interface does not require authentication, allowing remote access without verification.
*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The use of the outdated Apache Commons Collections library allows for deserialization attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Remote attackers can execute arbitrary Java functions or bytecode on the server.
*   This could lead to full remote control of the TP-Link EAP Controller server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the RMI protocol.
*   Attackers can send malicious serialized data to the vulnerable RMI service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the RMI service of the TP-Link EAP Controller.
*   No authentication is required to send malicious requests to the RMI service.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is a combination of missing authentication and use of a vulnerable library.
* The bundled vulnerable version of `Apache commons-collections v3.2.1` is the root cause of the deserialization vulnerability.
* The same deserialization vulnerability is documented under `CVE-2015-6420` and `VU#576313`.
