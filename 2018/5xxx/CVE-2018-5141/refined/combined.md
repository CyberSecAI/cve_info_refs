Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

##### References

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as `about:debugging`, if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open.

##### References

* [Bug 1408194](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408194)

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

##### References

* [Bug 1429379](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429379)

#### [#CVE-2018-5135: WebExtension browserAction can inject scripts into unintended contexts](#CVE-2018-5135)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use `browser.tabs.executeScript` to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged `about:` pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1431371](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1431371)

#### [#CVE-2018-5137: Script content can access legacy extension non-contentaccessible resources](#CVE-2018-5137)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate

Reporter

Impact
low
##### Description

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.

# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
I've created an application that uses the notification Push API. In the service worker JS. I've created a listener for the 'NotificationClose' event, which launches a DOM interaction (opens a new tab on browser).
Then, I've registered to the application with Firefox (allowing it to send me push notification).
Finally, I've sent few consecutive push notifications to the endpoint in a short time (for example 5 notification in 4 seconds).
Example code fro service worker is attached.
Actual results:
When sending few consecutive notifications, I was able to invoke the 'notification close' event without user interaction. Furthermore, each notification launched a new Tab (invoking a DOM event).
In essence:
1) If the browser was opened, I was able to remotely open an arbitrary amount of tabs on the browser without user interaction.
2) If the browser was closed, all the tabs open upon next launch.
This behavior puts the user in risk:
1) Adware: If the user once allowed a malicious application to send notification, now the ad providers can launch as many ads as they choose without the user interaction.
2) Persistence for attackers: if once I was able to get a user to register to my app, I can now redirect him to malicious link (for example containing CSRF or XSS) whenever I choose (for example I will send the user to a CSRF link again and again without his interaction, until he has a valid session with the target application).
3) Client side denial of service: I can launch infinite numbers of tabs every time the user opens the browser, effectively rendering the browser unusable.
It is important to stress that the user cannot stop the attack once the notifications were allowed, I.e. he cannot prevent the attacker from opening a tab on his browser
Expected results:
Events (such as 'close notification') should require user interaction. Furthermore:
1. close / push events should not allowed DOM interaction (opening a tab, for example). note that this is enforced in Chrome.
2. DOM intercations should be limited to 'one at a time', and not queued without restriction.

The issue is that we "allow window interaction" for any kind of notification event. We need to restrict this notification clicks.

Ben, I collect the things I understand so far and present them below. Could you correct me if I put anything wrong? And maybe give me some feedback? Thanks!
IIUC, we are going to disallow client.openWindow() on "notificationclose" event, but keep allowing it work on "notificationonclick" event.
After skimming the code, I found there are two places to increase the counter for WindowInteraction. One is in the WorkerRun [1] while the other is inside the AllowWindowInteractionHandler [2]. And the code for consuming the counter [3] (opposite to [1]) and [4] (opposite to [2]).
I guess [1, 3] cover all the microtasks in the event listener. But I'm not sure about whether should we ensure client.openWindow() in another task. And [2] covers even more.
For example, in the following case:
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
setTimeout(client.openWindow("foo.com"), 0); // Place A
Promise.resolve().then(client.openWindow("foo.com")); // Place B
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // Place C
notfication.close();
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // Place D
}
The order of executing client.openWindow is:
click's [1] -> click 's [2] -> C -> B -> A -> click's [3] -> close's [1] -> close's [2] -> D -> close's [3] -> close's [4] -> click's [4]
I think, ideally, we should resolve the promise at Place A, B, and C, but reject the promise at Place D. However, I'm sure whether shall we allow the window interaction in other tasks (e.g. set a timeout too long to make user realize the opening window is triggered by the notification click event).
If we shouldn't, then the solution would be as your suggestion in [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction") which is adding if-statement on [1, 3]. Besides, we might consider removing [2, 4].

BTW, chromium seems to only allow window interaction only when the event is notificationclick or payment:

Right, I think we want to look for the notificationclick event type string and only do the logic then.
I don't think you would do the check in StartClearWindowTimer(), though. I think instead it would be better to not create the AllowWindowInteractionHandler() at all.
Whether to remove the extra Allow/Consume calls might be a bit orthogonal. You could try to remove them, but if its easier we could also just make them all respect the event name check.
Something like:
bool allowInteraction = mEventName == NAME;
RefPtr<AllowWindowInteractionHandler> allowWindowInteraction
if (allowInteraction) {
aWorkerPrivate->GlobalScope()->AllowWindowInteraction();
allowWindowInteraction = new AllowWindowInteractionHandler(aWorkerPrivate);
}
nsresult rv = DispatchExtendableEventOnWorkerScope(aCx,
aWorkerPrivate->GlobalScope(),
event,
allowWindowInteraction);
/\* ... \*/
if (allowInteraction) {
aWorkerPrivate->GlobalScope()->ConsumeWindowInteraction();
}
Does that help?Flags: needinfo?(bkelly)

Yeah, we shouldn't create AllowWindowInteractionHandler for the notificationclose event if we don't want it to allow window interaction. That makes sense.

But it might allow clients to open window even in the notificationclose event when that event is triggered by a notificationclick event.
For example, just like the example in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"):
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
notfication.close();
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com");
}
In this example, the window will open. Do we allow that? I was thinking that we don't, but I'm not sure about it.
If we do, then I believe I don't need to remove the allow/consume pair in the AllowWindowInteractionHandler. If not, then we probably want to remove that pair.

The allow interaction is timer based. It should be permitted from other async callbacks if it's within the time window.
I think the extra calls around the dispatch might just support calling openWindow synchronously in a long running event handler.

Oh, I see. So, in this case, the window can be opened is because of the timer hasn't expired rather than triggered by the click event. And we do allow this happen.
Thanks for clearing my confusion!

Well, we start the timer right before firing the event handler. We should only do that for the click event and not the other events.

Hmm, then I dive into the code a bit more because it seems that we clear the window allow after running into handler for the close event in this case.
Sorry for misreading your comment :(

The timer is started as a side effect of creating the AllowWindowInteractionHandler():
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/88439dc6c5b02e167032374071cdc697a056efa1/dom/workers/ServiceWorkerPrivate.cpp#1168>
We create the AllowWindowInteractionHandler() right before dispatching the event:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/88439dc6c5b02e167032374071cdc697a056efa1/dom/workers/ServiceWorkerPrivate.cpp#1258>
Right now we do that before all notification events, but the bug here is to only do it before notificationclick events.
Looking at the code now, though, it seems we cancel the timer and call ConsumeWindowInteraction() when the function event's waitUntil() completes:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/88439dc6c5b02e167032374071cdc697a056efa1/dom/workers/ServiceWorkerPrivate.cpp#1117>
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/88439dc6c5b02e167032374071cdc697a056efa1/dom/workers/ServiceWorkerPrivate.cpp#1093>
So I think maybe I was confused. We want to allow async code to call clients.openWindow() until the notificationevent's waitUntil() promise resolves.
Sorry for my confusion here. This code is a bit hard to follow.
So I think you are mostly right about [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"), but you probably need to include a waitUntil() that covers A, B, and C.
Assuming notification.close() does not fire the notificationclose event synchronously (I don't think it should), then D should reject as you suggest.
I still think [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction") changes probably achieve this, but clearly this code could use some cleanup. Not sure if we want to do that here or in a follow-up that is not marked private.
Does that help at all or confuse things further? Thanks again for looking at this.

Hey guys,
I just want to add my opinion as a security researcher,
I think the potential impact of this bug is quite severe (I saw you marked the bug as a 'low risk' security event)
The situation is that I, the attacker, can cause a victim to visit any link I choose, whenever I choose, and as many times as I choose.
So any reflected cross site scripting I detect in any website - I can make sure the user is impacted:
1) I detect a reflected XSS in website A
2) I create a link the exploits the XSS
3) I send the link to the user inside a notification (for example as the notification data), and force the user to visit the link
using the 'close' event.
4) I monitor the exploitation from my CNC server:
a. If the user had a session with website A when he visited it, I win (as i get to execute my javascript in the context of website A domain).
b IF the user did not have a logged in session, I simply wait some time and fire the attack again.
This is obviously a very simple example. The same can be used to exploit many other vulnerabilities (CSRF, Phishing, adware, Exploit kits, etc.).
The point is that having the ability to force a client to visit any website of my choosing again and again is a very strong asset to the attacker and puts the client in quite a serious risk.
So, please consider giving the issue a higher security rating.
Thanks

That makes sense to me. Thanks for elaborating on it!
For correction, if I apply the [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"):
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
event.notfication.close();
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // the window won't be opened
}
I guess what I get stuck is that I accidently found a strage way to open window in the close evnet after applying [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction").
For example, if I specify to close the notification in the existing test [1] just above the waitUntil:
onnotificationclick = function(e) {
...
e.notfication.close();
e.waitUntil(Promise.All(promises).then(() => client.postMessage(results)));
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com");
}
Then, I found the window is still opened even after I do the check as your [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction").
I guess maybe it's an another issue for waitUtil(f) while the "f" takes tons of time? I'll investigate more about this.

Well, if the notificationclose event handler is fired before the waitUntil promises resolve, then in theory it should be allowed to open the window. But this only really matters if the notificationclick did not open a window. If the click opened a window then it should have consumed the interaction.
The important thing is we only allow one additional "open a window" token per click dispatch.
If you try to open a window in both click and close, do you get two windows?
(Maybe this does argue for trying to remove any extraneous AllowWindowInteraction() calls as that might allow two windows to be synchronously opened in the click handler.)

(In reply to Ben Kelly [:bkelly] from [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c18 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"))
I'm afraid I might misunderstand something. I put them as follows:
> Well, if the notificationclose event handler is fired before the waitUntil
> promises resolve, then in theory it should be allowed to open the window.
Yeah, it looks like the close event is fired before the promises in waitUntil() is resolved.
> But this only really matters if the notificationclick did not open a window.
Because the close event is fired before the promise in waitUntil() is resolved, we can make client's window be opened even if the click event doesn't call clients.openWindow().
For example:
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
event.notfication.close();
event.waitUntil(client.focus());
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // The window will be opened
}
I guess my problem is whether should allow this window to be opened?
> If the click opened a window then it should have consumed the interaction.
Sorry, I'm a little confused here. I reckon I might misunderstand something. Please correct me if there is anything wrong.
If we don't call the clients.windowOpen() in the click event handler, the window interaction will still be consumed.
The open window doesn't consume the interaction. The current implementation consumes the interaction at the end of WorkerRun() [1] and ClearWindowAllowed() [2]. And it seems we don't trigger either of them after calling openWindow() [3]. Therefore, we can open few windows in the current test test\_openWindow.html [4] (testForUrl calls clients.openWindow). (Note: I run the test with lldb and there are two allow & consume pairs. The first interaction is consumed by the end of WorkerRun, and the second interaction is consumed by timer's callback [5]).

I'm not sure about one additional "open a window" token. Do you mean we allow open a window in the close event handler if it's trigger by the click event handler? Can you elaborate on that?
> If you try to open a window in both click and close, do you get two windows?
The answer is yes.
But the behavior doesn't change whether opening a window in the click event or not.
For example:
// get client from onmessage (client = event.source)
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
clients.openWindow("foo.com"); // A
event.notfication.close();
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // The client will open a window by A (Won't open a window if without A)
}
//-------
onnotificationclick = function(event) {
clients.openWindow("foo.com"); // A
event.notfication.close();
event.waitUntil(client.focus());
}
onnotificationclose = function(event) {
client.openWindow("foo.com"); // The client will open two windows (Will open a window if without A).
}

I guess I'm trying to say when a notificationclick event occurs we should only increase WorkerScope::mWindowInteractionAllowed by one:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/workers/WorkerScope.h#65>
Currently we are increasing it by two because we call AllowWindowInteraction() twice. We consume one of those synchronously after the event handler runs, but don't consume the other one until either waitUntil() promise resolves or the timer fires.
So I think we should remove the AllowWindowInteraction() and ConsumeWindowInteraction() calls here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/41925c0b6c6d58578690121de439d2a8d3d690f3/dom/workers/ServiceWorkerPrivate.cpp#1256>

And then only create the AllowWindowInteractionHandler if the event is exactly notificationclick instead of any notification event.

Oh, I see! So, you are right in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"), which is [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction") can already achieve this. The call for AllowWindowInteraction() in WorkerRun() seems to be redundant. But, I'd like to do it together with [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction"), since the change is small.
Sorry for taking so much time to understand...
I was thinking to avoid allowing the window interaction in the close event (even if it's triggered by the click event). But, I find out I don't need to worry about that because the click event needs users' interaction to trigger.

Could you tell me more about it?
I have considered using waitUntil(), but I was not sure how to do it's better.
The main document (test\_notificationclose.html) will wait for its iframe's callback (notificationclose.html). The iframe is the client of the service worker (notificationclose.js) and it is waiting for the postMessage() from the service worker. The iframe will notify the main document after receiving the message.
So, I decided to the pass extra information in the postMessage and used await to make sure the promise for openWindow() is rejected before posting the message to the client.
If I want to add waitUtil(), I thought I should add it at the place of client.postMessage(). But, since it's in a for-loop (though, it should just have only one client), I was afraid it would lead the test to be confusing.
BTW, should I uplift this to Beta after I got the security-approval?

You can just do the waitUntil around the whole thing. Instead of passing the async function as the event handler do:
onnotificationclose = function(evt) {
evt.waitUntil(async function() {
// handler body
}());
};
If we can land this before next week, then no uplift is necessary. It's too late to get it in 58.

Oh, I see! Thanks!
I was restricting myself to use waitUtil() for a single line...

[Bug 1429093](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093 "RESOLVED FIXED - Push API allows DOM event without user interaction") - P1: Only allow notification click to call allowWindowInteraction. r=bkelly
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Service worker push notifications
[User impact if declined]: A malicious website with push permissions could spam the user with notifications and new tabs.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Test in P2 patch.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: The fix has been in nightly for a day and it has a test. I don't think we have formally verified it, though.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: No.
[Is the change risky?]: Low risk.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: The change is contained to only notification related code and relatively small. The risk of functional regressions is low.
[String changes made/needed]: None

DOS attacks are generally rated as "low" per our rating guidelines at <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings>, linked to from our security pages at <http://www.mozilla.org/security/>. DOS attacks are only rated about sec-low if they are persistent, which this attack isn't.

> Will there be a security bounty attached to this bug?
Not by default, no. If you are interested in the bug bounty program, you need to write to us at our security@mozilla.org email address and ask it to be considered for bounty. Please read the program guidelines at <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/client-bug-bounty/>. We will not automatically flag bugs for bounty except in very unusual circumstances as there is no guarantee that people from the bounty committee will see all issues.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Tested on Nightly 59.0a1 (2017-12-07) (64-bit).
View attached PoC.
Actual results:
It seems that we can still link moz-icon urls if we include the current pages URL within it like so: moz-icon:<http://localhost/poc.html?size=64&contentType=application/xml>
I then noticed that we can read the image through canvas.toDataURL. So we are now able to determine which application is used to open certain file types, as well as potential fingerprinting of user within private browsing (?).
Expected results:
moz-icon should be blocked from linking on the web. Also I think its worth checking why canvas.toDataURL is working here.

Doesn't work on macOS with e10s because of sandboxing (see [bug 1419811](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419811 "RESOLVED FIXED - [macOS][e10s] File listings no longer show icons for non-folders")).
Prior to [bug 1222924](/show_bug.cgi?id=1222924 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop exposing the moz-icon URL scheme to the web"), you could just do this the easy way by using moz-icon://.xml?size=16 , so it seems this being broken on 58 beta is kind of expected - but I think being able to read it doesn't work on 57/58 with just moz-icon://.xml?size=16 .
Either way, it's unexpected that it's still possible to do this on nightly. On the other hand, I'm a bit confused/worried that it seems in/after [bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files."), we didn't restrict moz-icon to only be have nested file: URIs.

It seems like the URL is treated completely same origin, we can even frame it and execute js in it.
<iframe src="moz-icon:<http://localhost/evil.ani>" onload="window[0].eval('alert(location)')"></iframe>
Perhaps there is something checking to see if a given url contains {uri-scheme}:<http://{same-origin-domain>}.. and automatically gives it same-origin status?

There are at least 4 ways of fixing this:
- <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/281d99b3d342b71d0653b872345761372d38f5c1/caps/nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp#843-845>
should be checking aTargetURI instead of aTargetBaseURI .
- <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/a461fe03fdb07218b7f50e92c59dde64b8f8a5b0/image/decoders/icon/nsIconURI.cpp#208>
and any other entrypoints into moz-icon URI constructors should only allow 'file' inner URIs.
- the contentType query parameter shouldn't do anything when there's a nested URI (not 100% sure if this is a red herring - I'd expect "foo.com/bar.<extension>" might also get you an icon for that extension, without the contentType param)
- [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1171853#c6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853#c6 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript")
I'll see what I can do about getting patches for these. At least the moz-icon inner http URI one should be easy to fix. I don't know how much fallout there would be from fixing the first issue. From what I can tell quickly, moz-icon is the only UI\_RESOURCE URI type that is ever nested, so it should be fine, but perhaps I'm missing something. Like, perhaps that'll break file: directory listing icons again (sigh...).
[bug 1171853](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript") is going to be more work to address, and isn't generally an issue because if you've got a nested URI that points to foo.com, it's mostly sensible that it's same-origin with "actual" foo.com . But for that to be the case, the data that a channel to that URI provides would actually want to come from foo.com, which clearly isn't the case here.
It would help if there was a sec rating on this bug so I had an idea about how cautious I need to be about pushing to try. While I'm annoyed that I missed this, I don't know how severe "know what applications the user has installed" is, in the general case. Sec-moderate, from a quick look at the severity ratings page?Assignee: nobody → gijskruitbosch+bugsStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: true

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8936419&action=edit)

I tried to create a blob URL within the moz-icon URL and apparently I got a possible stack corruption tab crash:
Possible Stack Corruption starting at xul!mozilla\_dump\_image+0x0000000000928669 (Hash=0xa1943e15.0xf278a43e)
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/b8b3001b-e0b2-42ec-957d-463540171212>
Also I attached the dump log where possible stack corruption was seen (using 'exploitable' module)
To repro:
<iframe src="moz-icon:<http://localhost/evil.ani>" onload="window[0].eval(`URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([''],{type:'text/html'}))`)"></iframe>
Doesn't work within view-source: page so it seems unique to moz-icon. This may be a sign that this context will result in unexpected behavior. Will test more.

New crash report using similar poc as above (except I loaded a moz-icon uri with a lot of junk in it)
Notice some of the frames are hex with no name, isn't that bad?:
<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/87bf5f3a-51f0-41fc-a831-4364b0171212>
Should I open a new bug for that? or deal with it all here?

[bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files.") was sec-low, and this doesn't even confirm the existence of actual local files, just whether specific mime types are set to be handled by specific programs, which seems less serious (given that up until pretty recently, you could just ask the 'plugins' object whether the adobe acrobat npapi plugin was installed, for instance). So going to mark as sec-low and land the patches. Ni'ing Dan so he can change severity if necessary.
I'll try to address point 4 from [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - moz-icon images can be linked and read from the web") in [bug 1171853](/show_bug.cgi?id=1171853 "NEW - View-source allows reading the browser cache from JavaScript") either before or after the Christmas / New Year's break, depending on the rest of my queue. I don't currently have any reason to believe it's urgent given the other restrictions that are in place.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-disclosure](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-disclosure&resolution=---),

[Bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files.")'s reporter never provided a working PoC thus the sec-low.

(In reply to Abdulrahman Alqabandi from [comment #15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - moz-icon images can be linked and read from the web"))
> [Bug 1173214](/show_bug.cgi?id=1173214 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use of the moz-icon protocol can confirm the existence of local files.")'s reporter never provided a working PoC thus the sec-low.
It's true that they didn't provide a working PoC, but even detecting arbitrary local files is only sec-moderate, and as I already said, this bug seems less severe (it doesn't detect arbitrary local files - it detects application handlers that are (or were!) installed, and not even their paths).
Either way, whether it's sec-low or sec-moderate, this can land without sec-approval, which is the salient point for me landing it right now... Seems pretty clear this isn't sec-high/crit.

Doesn't seem worth backporting to me, but feel free to set the status to affected and request approval if you feel strongly otherwise.
