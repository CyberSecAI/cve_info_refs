  "cveId": "CVE-2018-5141",
  "description": "A vulnerability in the notifications Push API where notifications can be sent through service workers by web content without direct user interaction. This could be used to open new tabs in a denial of service (DOS) attack or to display unwanted content from arbitrary URLs to users.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the Push API, where notifications can be triggered by service workers without requiring explicit user interaction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper control of the Push API",
      "Lack of user interaction enforcement for notification events",
       "Unrestricted DOM manipulation via notification close events"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this to open new tabs, display unwanted content from arbitrary URLs, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can also be used to redirect users to malicious links for phishing or other attacks.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Web-based attacks via malicious web content",
      "Exploitation of service worker push notifications",
       "Abuse of the 'notification close' event"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send push notifications through a service worker, which requires the user to have previously granted notification permissions to a malicious website. No further user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability after the initial permission grant."
