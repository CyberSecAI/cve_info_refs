#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

##### References

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as `about:debugging`, if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open.

##### References

* [Bug 1408194](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408194)

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

##### References

* [Bug 1419166](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419166)

#### [#CVE-2018-5137: Script content can access legacy extension non-contentaccessible resources](#CVE-2018-5137)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A legacy extension's non-contentaccessible, defined resources can be loaded by an arbitrary web page through script. This script does this by using a maliciously crafted path string to reference the resources.
*Note: this vulnerability does not affect WebExtensions.*

Reporter
rugk
Impact
low
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1432624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432624)

#### [#CVE-2018-5140: Moz-icon images accessible to web content through moz-icon: protocol](#CVE-2018-5140)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Image for moz-icons can be accessed through the `moz-icon:` protocol through script in web content even when otherwise prohibited. This could allow for information leakage of which applications are associated with specific MIME types by a malicious page.

##### References

* [Bug 1424261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261)

#### [#CVE-2018-5141: DOS attack through notifications Push API](#CVE-2018-5141)

Reporter
Zohar
Impact
low
##### Description

A vulnerability in the notifications Push API where notifications can be sent through service workers by web content without direct user interaction. This could be used to open new tabs in a denial of service (DOS) attack or to display unwanted content from arbitrary URLs to users.

##### References

* [Bug 1429093](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093)

#### [#CVE-2018-5142: Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2018-5142)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown protocol" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1366357](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366357)

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.

##### References

* [Bug 1422643](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422643)

#### [#CVE-2018-5126: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59](#CVE-2018-5126)

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Attached file
[csp\_bypass\_require\_chromeurl.html](attachment.cgi?id=8945158)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8945158&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Build ID: 20180122220231
Steps to reproduce:
This bug exists in Firefox's legacy extension system. The legacy extension is still used in the browser internally.
Usually, only if the extension's resources are defined on `chrome.manifest` and it has a `contentaccessible=yes` flag, the defined resources can be loaded from web pages via <script> tag or other tags. However, by using crafted path string, even non-contentaccessible resources can be loaded from web pages. Due to this bug, as I described in [bug 1432358](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432358 "VERIFIED FIXED - Universal CSP strict-dynamic bypass via require.js of browser resource"), it causes an universal bypass of CSP strict-dynamic via chrome:// URL. I attached PoC again.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See `chrome.manifest` file of browser internal resources from the following URL (in case of Windows):
jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/chrome.manifest
2. Find this line:
content browser browser/content/browser/ contentaccessible=yes
This means that any web pages can load the resources placed on jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/browser/content/browser/\* via chrome://browser/content/\* URLs.
3. The resources placed on jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/devtools/\* do not have a contentaccessible flag. So, usually it should not be loaded from web pages.
However, using the following crafted URL, it can be loaded from web pages:
(Please take notice to the two slashes of "content//chrome". )
chrome://browser/content//chrome/devtools/modules/devtools/client/jsonview/lib/require.js
It seems that the following path format causes this issue:
chrome:// [ACCESSIBLE\_PATH] // [NON\_ACCESSIBLE\_PATH]

Basically this means all of omni.ja (and all of any jar file with any contentaccessible content, afaict) is contentaccessible=yes. That's not great. :-(Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

This also works with a '%2F' suffix, and also with ' /' (ie whitespace before the extra slash).

Bobby, is this a crazy idea? It seems to work in my testing. Not sure how terrible this is for performance and/or if we should pursue something else or there's a simpler way to accomplish this.

Tentative patch
So the fundamental problem is that we're doing this:
NS\_NewURI(aResult, path, nullptr, baseURI)
where "path" is something that starts with '/', right?
I wonder whether we could even have "path" start with something like "file://whatever" and get somewhere that way... That is, is there an actual guarantee that baseURI and resultingURI have the same scheme here?
I also wonder how ".." bits in the relative path would work.
I guess this approach of checking the full spec or jar path mostly handles all those cases in the situations when the baseURI is jar: or file:, which is good. But we should probably also fail out for any case in which baseURI and resultingURI have different schemes, even if baseURI's scheme is something other than "jar" or "file".
We should check what happens with ".." in the file:// case. Does that get canonicalized or preserved? If the latter, then we can have the substring thing testing true but still be walking all over the disk...
I did check, and nsIURI.resolve would \_not\_ help us out here. So this seems like the sanest approach barring a better necko API around this stuff or changes to how we represent these URLs.

I don't know of any way to change the scheme of a URI when the path is relative, unless you include a protocol in `path`, which we guard for at the link below.
> I also wonder how ".." bits in the relative path would work.
Not obvious from this diff, but those should be being caught here, right: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/474d58c9137360c0fa1c85cdd11e3313b33b7cad/chrome/nsChromeRegistry.cpp#234-258> ?
I considered adding stuff there, but I decided I didn't want to risk missing some bizarre escape sequence that would still end up with a relative path starting with '/', given that leading whitespace is just getting ignored (and, presumably, ditto for things like leading close-to-0 bytes, given the URL parsing spec...).
Would you prefer if I tried to add stuff to Canonify? Because relative paths must be allowed (ie chrome://browser/content/foo/bar/baz.xul should still work) just outlawing '/' the way we outlaw ':' won't work. I did consider restricting the path component to something like [a-zA-Z0-9#\_-] but figured that might still break things. Particularly query strings. And once you get URI escaping for query strings / hashes, restricting the unescaped version to that set is harder, and might break things again. Perhaps I'm too pessimistic about that... Anyway, I'd given up on that avenue, but perhaps that was premature or there was an easy fix I was missing...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Mostly asking because I'm somewhat nervous about the perf implication of running all these resolve() calls and full string/spec comparisons for any attempt to use chrome URIs. :-(
I'd push to try but this is a sec bug, and anyway I'm not sure how to easily check the perf implications here.

chrome://browser/content/file:///etc/passwd
or so is what I meant here. As you note, nsChromeRegistry::Canonify already handles this.
I have to admit that it seems to me like checking for leading whitespace or leading '/' in canonify and bailing out if found should fix this, possibly at lower perf cost. But as you note with a bit more room for error...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

One option is to land the string comparison for now and then at more leisure investigate beefing up Canonify and removing the string compare.

Hm. I guess we could just require the first character of the path to be [a-zA-Z0-9]. That'd break this attack, including any whitespace variants, and be a lot cheaper. Unless I'm missing something? :-)

That seems like an \_excellent\_ mitigation. In practice, I assume we can require it to be [a-zA-Z], even, no? Or even [a-z].

It seems we have non-test files that start with numbers (several dozen in browser/ alone). I don't know if any of them get packaged in the root of any chrome packages but I decided I didn't want to take the risk (and the potential confusion in the future if people tried to use such names).

I think this would be a lot clearer like so:
if (!('a' <= \*pos && \*pos <= 'z') &&
!('A' <= \*pos && \*pos <= 'Z') &&
!('0' <= \*pos && \*pos <= '9')) {
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_BAD\_URI;
}
or so. Thoughts?

Oh, of course. That works. I just never think of things like this because my brain is too JS-wired. No char-to-int conversion, you only get "0".charCodeAt(0) and that \* 6 is just yucky.

Patch v2
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: security issue
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: There are existing automated tests. I didn't add any because it's a security fix and that'd reveal what the specific issue is. Also because it's reasonably trivial to test manually. I'll file a follow-up to add automated tests specifically for this issue.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet, will land on central later today.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: yes:
1. open browser
2. try loading these URLs:
chrome://browser/content//
chrome://browser/content/ /
(lots of spaces)
They should load the default search engine or an error page, as opposed to a file listing (pre-patch)
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none.
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: simple checks that limit chrome URI syntax to avoid this issue, which is a safe change to make because we no longer have to deal with external add-ons, and because in-product consumers would never use these URIs.
[String changes made/needed]: no.

I managed to reproduce the issue with the steps from [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432870#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Path traversal on chrome:// URLs") on Windows 10 x64 using an older version of Nightly (2018-01-24).
I retested everything on latest Nightly 60.0a1 and beta 59.0b7 on Windows 10 x 64, Ubuntu 16.04 x64 and macOS 10.13 and the issue is not reproducing anymore. Every time the default search engine page is loaded.
I did find an issue though. If I try to open the page with the command "Paste & Go", the page never loads and in the Network Monitor there are no request displayed.

Please file a separate bug for this that is not security sensitive. Do not link to this bug in any way. As a test-case for that bug, use "chrome://browser/content/../../", which shows the same behaviour even before this patch.
