**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a vulnerability in Clustered Data ONTAP that allows sensitive information to be disclosed to an unauthorized user. The specific mechanism is not detailed in the provided advisory but seems related to the `system configuration backup` command.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated but unauthorized user to access sensitive information, which includes passwords. This indicates insufficient access control and inadequate protection of sensitive data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Impact**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of passwords to an authenticated but unauthorized user. This could potentially enable an attacker to gain further unauthorized access or compromise system security.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Attack Vector**: The attack vector is local. The provided CVSS vector indicates this is a local attack.
    - `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Required Capabilities/Position**:
        - The attacker needs to be an *authenticated* user, but one who is *unauthorized* to access the sensitive information.
        - The attacker needs to execute the "system configuration backup" command on the affected versions of Clustered Data ONTAP.
        - The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system (`AV:L`).
        - The attacker must have high privileges (`PR:H`).

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

CVE-2018-5497 is a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in NetApp's Clustered Data ONTAP. An authenticated but unauthorized user with local access and high privileges can exploit this flaw by running the `system configuration backup` command which results in disclosure of passwords. The vulnerability is addressed in specific releases mentioned in the advisory.
