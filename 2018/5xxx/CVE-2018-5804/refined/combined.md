How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 \* H265 (Canon) and JPEG-XL thumbnail support for dcraw\_make\_mem\_thumb Note: libraw\_processed\_image\_t.type is set to LIBRAW\_IMAGE\_H265 or  LIBRAW\_IMAGE\_JPEGXL respectively
2024-09-18 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Fixed possible buffer overrun in old panasonic decoder \* Most small buffer allocations: malloc changed to calloc to prevent  uninitialized heap data leaks \* Large buffer allocation (RAW backing store, thumbnails store): If LIBRAW\_CALLOC\_RAWSTORE is defined on build: large buffers will be  allocated via calloc
2024-03-30 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
 LibRaw-snapshot-202403
 \* Raw format support  1) Panasonic encoding 8
 2) Sony YCC (Medium/Small compression) pseudo-RAW support:  -- normal processing (3-channel RGB output) -- or YCbCr output if LIBRAW\_RAWSPECIAL\_SRAW\_NO\_RGB bit is set in imgdata.rawparams.specials (one may specify the  LIBRAW\_RAWSPECIAL\_SRAW\_NO\_INTERPOLATE flag too avoid Cb/Cr interpolation) Note: if YCbCr is selected, Cb/Cr neutral points are adjusted to 8192 (to fit histogram/range area of the Y channel) -- RAW (pseudo-RAW) data is already white balanced, so  imgdata.color.as\_shot\_wb\_applied is set to  LIBRAW\_ASWB\_APPLIED | LIBRAW\_ASWB\_SONY
 3) DNG 1.7 (including JPEG-XL compression) support via Adobe DNG SDK 1.7.x integration
 4) Canon CRN files: embedded RAW extracted
 \* Camera support - Canon EOS R6 Mark II, EOS R8, EOS R50, EOS R100, EOS Ra - Fujifilm GFX100-II, X-T5, X-S20, X-H2, X-H2S: support of files with wrong metadata (pre 1.03 fw) - GoPro HERO11, HERO12 (via GoPro SDK) - Hasselblad X2D-100c - Leica Q3, M11 Monochrom - Nikon Z30, Z8 (HE/HE\* formats are not supported) - OM Digital OM-5 - Panasonic DC-G9 II, DC-ZS200D / ZS220D, DC-TZ200D / TZ202D / TZ220D, DC-S5-II, DC-GH6 - Sony A7C-II, A7CR, ILCE-6700, ZV-1M2, ZV-E1, ILCE-7RM5 (A7R-V), ILME-FX30, A1: support for files damaged by exiftool  - Multiple DJI and Skydio drones - tested with multiple smartphones with DNG format recorded.
 \* Sony DSC-HX95: improved metadata parsing
 \* Better support for cropped images from latest Fujifilm cameras (X-H2, X-H2S, X-T5)
 \* As planned in LibRaw snapshot 202101 release notes, OLD\_VIDEOCAMS  support is dropped. These cameras are no longer supported: - old RED Cine cameras - Canon C500 - ARRI video/digital cinema cameras
 \* JPEG-XL previews (DNG 1.7) support: - new bit for imgdata.rawparams.options: LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_ALLOW\_JPEGXL\_PREVIEWS (not set by default) - if the bit is set, LibRaw will perceive such previews in the same way as JPEG ones (largest preview is selected by default, etc). - tformat field for such preview is set to LIBRAW\_THUMBNAIL\_JPEGXL - image metadata (width/height/channels count) is not parsed for JPEG-XL previews
 \* New patch for RawSpeed3: 05.no-phase-one-correction.patch this patch disables RawSpeed's PhaseOne flat field correction (not needed because LibRaw uses own P1-metadata based correction)
 \* RawSpeed3/PhaseOne compressed files: scale unpacked data to match camer black level data.
 \* New imgdata.params.use\_p1\_correction parameter If set to non-zero (default): PhaseOne compressed files will be corrected (linearization; defect mapping) based on metadata contained in file.
 \* New possible bit in imgdata.process\_warnings: LIBRAW\_WARN\_VENDOR\_CROP\_SUGGESTED If set: unknown/untested RAW image frame size passed to LibRaw, cropping may be incorrect. It is suggested to use LibRaw::adjust\_to\_raw\_inset\_crop(1) for vendor specified crop.  \* LibRaw::adjust\_to\_raw\_inset\_crop exposed via C-API call: libraw\_adjust\_to\_raw\_inset\_crop(libraw\_data\_t \*lr, unsigned mask, float maxcrop); Note: default maxcrop value for C++ API is 0.55f
 \* Better handling of DNG RAW Previews with Stage2 opcodes
 \* Added imgdata.makernotes.sony.AspectRatio field - if parsed: contains aspect ratio (width to height) - if not parsed: initialized to -999.f
 \* Nikon Z8/HLG mode: do not add 10 bit/unknown format thumbnails to the thumb\_list
 \* Canon CR2 16-bit bitmap previes: do not convert from Kodak colorspace
 \* New compile-defined limit LIBRAW\_MAX\_PROFILE\_SIZE\_MB:  limits allocation/read size for embedded color profile (default: 256Mb)
 \* Embedded color profile allocation/read size: limited by input file size.
 \* Check against corrupted LJPEG header in Canon sRAW decoder  \* Better support for Sony metadata
 \* Better handling of memory allocation errors in unpack\_thumb()
 \* Support for 8bit/Monochrome DNG Previews
 \* LibRaw::thumbOK(): return 0 for YCbCr thumbnails (because unpack\_thumb() will always return error: no correct thumbnails with this format found in the image samples yet)
 \* Improved Sigma X3F files model recognition
 \* Placeholder for DNG/YCC preview decoding: such previews are recorded by Samsung S21 Ultra smartfone, while all present samples contains broken data; Right now 'no preview' returned for such files.
 \* Support for BW bitmap previews in LibRaw::dcraw\_thumb\_writer
 \* Phase One: explicitly switch to monochrome mode if firmware string contains 'Achromatic' word
 \* tiff parser: check for IFD offset before parsing it

 LibRaw 0.21
 == Camera format support == \* Phase One/Leaf IIQ-S v2 support \* Canon CR3 filmrolls \* Canon CRM (movie) files \* Tiled bit-packed (and 16-bit unpacked) DNGs \* (non-standard) Deflate-compressed integer DNG files are allowed
== Camera support ==
 \* Canon EOS R3, R7 and R10 \* Fujifilm X-H2S, X-T30 II \* OM System OM-1 \* Leica M11 \* Sony A7-IV (ILCE-7M4) \* DJI Mavic 3 \* Nikon Z9: standard compression formats only
 == Multiple (resolution) thumbnails support ==  \* New imgdata.thumbs\_list data item with data fields:
 int thumbcount: thumbnail count  libraw\_thumbnail\_item\_t thumblist[LIBRAW\_THUMBNAIL\_MAXCOUNT]: list of thumbnails
 libraw\_thumbnail\_item\_t fields:
 enum LibRaw\_internal\_thumbnail\_formats tformat: internal thumbnail format (this is not PPM/JPEG, but internal type related to thumbnail reading/unpacking method)
 ushort twidth, theight: thumbnail image size.
 ushort tflip: image rotation (see notes below)  unsigned tlength: on-disk data size (not uncompressed for compressed formats)  unsigned tmisc: bit depth and channel count: (color << 5) | bitsperpixel  INT64 toffset: Thumbnail data offset in file
 Notes: - Only TIFF-based and CR3 files are parsed for thumbnail list, other formats will have thumbcount = 1.
 - If no thumbnails are found in file: thumbcount will be set to 1 and thumblist[0] will be initialized with data from thumbnail fields,  so LibRaw::unpack\_thumb\_ex(0) will do the same as LibRaw::unpack\_thumb()
 - Thumbnail image size may be unknown (not recorded in metadata), in this case twidth and theight are zero. Usually small(er) thumbnails will always have twidth/theight filled, while largest one may have these fields set to zero.
 - Thumbnail rotation (tflip) is filled only for TIFF-based RAWs (if Orientation tag is not present in IFD, default zero value is used) For non-tiff images, tflip is initialized to 0xffff (not known...)
 - There is no code to select thumbnail based on some criteria (e.g. minimal resolution), it is left to user to implement such a criteria, if needed (see unpack\_thumb\_ex() call below)
 - If you want to get largest possible thumbnail: just use old unpack\_thumb() call to get it.
 \* new API call: LibRaw::unpack\_thumb\_ex(int i): Unpacks i-th thumbnail if it exists into imgdata.thumbnail structure i should be non-zero and less then imgdata.thumbs\_list.thumbcount.   \* samples/simple\_dcraw.cpp: new -E command line switch to extract all thumbnails from input file(s)
 == (Experimental) RawSpeed "version 3" (develop branch) support. ==
 Build with -DUSE\_RAWSPEED3, see details in RawSpeed3/README.md
 LibRaw::capabilities will set bit LIBRAW\_CAPS\_RAWSPEED3 if compiled w/ RawSpeed-v3 support
 If file was processed (or tried to process) via RawSpeed-v3, these bits are raised in imgdata.process\_warnings: LIBRAW\_WARN\_RAWSPEED3\_PROCESSED - processed via RawSpeed v3 LIBRAW\_WARN\_RAWSPEED3\_PROBLEM - not processed (due to exception in RawSpeed library) LIBRAW\_WARN\_RAWSPEED3\_UNSUPPORTED - unsupported file LIBRAW\_WARN\_RAWSPEED3\_NOTLISTED - file not listed in cameras.xml data
 RawSpeed-v3 support is controlled via libraw\_decoder\_info.t->flags  (LIBRAW\_DECODER\_TRYRAWSPEED3 bit). The bit is set for: - lossless jpeg decoder - Canon sRAW decoder - lossless compressed and packed-compressed DNG decoders - Pentax decoder - Nikon (compressed) decoder - Phase One Compressed and Hasselblad/Compressed decoders - bitpacked decoder - Panasonic (old 12-bit compression) decoder - Olympus decoder - Sony ARW (v1 and v2) decoders - Samsung (version 1) decoder
 \* (Experimental) Fine control of RawSpeed version selection/use. To enable, build LibRaw with -DUSE\_RAWSPEED\_BITS LibRaw::capabilities will set bit LIBRAW\_CAPS\_RAWSPEED\_BITS if compiled with this flag. If enabled:  imgdata.rawparams.use\_rawspeed becomes bit-field (instead of 0/1 off/on)  with bits: LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV1\_USE - use RawSpeed Version 1 (if compiled with) LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV1\_FAILONUNKNOWN - do not process unknown files  (not listed in RawSpeed v1 camera definitions file) LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV1\_IGNOREERRORS - ignore mirror decoding errors (out of range data,etc)
 LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV3\_USE - Use RawSpeed Version 3 (if compiled with) LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV3\_FAILONUNKNOWN - do not process unknown files LIBRAW\_RAWSPEEDV3\_IGNOREERRORS - ignore minor decoding errors  == Misc changes/improvements == \* New compile time define LIBRAW\_OWN\_SWAB to use on platforms without swab() in C/C++ runtime
 \* New imgdata.rawparams.options bit: LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_CANON\_IGNORE\_MAKERNOTES\_ROTATION If set: image orientation is set based on TIFF/IFD0:Orientation tag, makernotes orientation data is ignored
 \* Nikon makernotes: read NEFCompression tag for HE/HE\* files
 \* Nikon orientation tag: more fixed offsets for known cameras
 \* Adobe DNG SDK 1.6 support (meaning, just an additional patch for GPR SDK)
 \* removed LibRaw::memerr(), memory allocation failures are already handled in LibRaw\_memmgr::\*alloc w/ exception thrown
 \* removed memory error callback, out-of-memory error should be handled via returned error code check, all related parameters (e.g. LibRaw constructor option to not set such callback) is also removed
 \* imgdata.params.adjust\_maximum\_thr is settable via C-API libraw\_set\_adjust\_maximum\_thr(..)
 \* New rawoptions/processing flags for DNG processing if compiled  with Adobe DNG SDK: LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_DNG\_STAGE2\_IFPRESENT,LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_DNG\_STAGE3\_IFPRESENT If these flag(s) are set: Stage2/Stage3 processing will be performed only if OpcodeList2/OpcodeList3 tags are present in the input DNG file Old (hard) flags (LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_DNG\_STAGE2 and  LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_DNG\_STAGE3) are not removed and will force Stage2/3 processing if set (regardless of input file tags)
 \* New imgdata.rawparams.options bit: LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_DNG\_ADD\_MASKS If set: DNG Transparency Masks will be extracted (if selected via shot\_select)
 \* New decoder flag: LIBRAW\_DECODER\_UNSUPPORTED\_FORMAT
 == Bugs fixed ==
 \* Fixed possible out-of-buffer read in Nikon orientation tag parser
 \* Windows datastream: fixed logic errors (not showing up in real life)
 \* Out-of-range read-only array access in postprocessing if output\_color is set to 0 (raw color)
 \* Minolta Z2 was not recognized correctly on 32-bit systems  \* Fixed possible buffer overflow in Kodak C330 decoder
 \* dcraw\_process(): check for buffer allocation results to avoid NULL deref
2021-10-11 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Apple iPhone 13 Pro GoPro HERO10 (if compiled w/ USE\_GPR\_SDK) Ricoh GR III Sony Xperia 1 III
 \* Fuji RAF files: XMP block extraction
 \* Fixed a typo in LIBRAW\_OPTIONS\_\* flag names (was LIBRAW\_OPIONS, old flags names not removed due to compatibility)
 \* samples/raw-identify.cpp: -v flag documented in usage print.
2021-09-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Fujifilm GFX 50S II Nikon Z fc Sony A7R-IIIA (ILCE-7RM3A), A7R-IVA (ILCE-7RM4A)
 \* API/datastruct Changes: - imgdata.params.shot\_select moved to imgdata.rawparams.shot\_select (because this is decode-time option, not postprocessing option)
 - libraw\_open\_bayer(...) added to C-API
 - imgdata.makernotes.canon: separate SensorLeftBorder,SensorTopBorder.... (and many other datafields) are united in libraw\_area\_t (rectangle) groups for crop areas and optical black areas.
 \* src/libraw\_cxx.cpp completely removed from source tree to not confuse users. (also all mentions are removed from Makefiles)
 \* Better Olympus makernotes parsing: LiveND mode, Panorama mode tags.
 \* clang-cl compatibility: - defines \_MSC\_VER, but \_forceinline is not supported - warnings eliminated in Windows buffered datastream
 \* Canon/12-bit files: adjust color.linear\_max and makernotes.canon values to match data range.
2021-08-04 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Sony ZV-E10 \* DNG/Floating point: additional metadata check to refuse ambiguous/corrupted files. \* DNG/Floating point: correct handling of striped files (never seen in wild) \* Rawspeed support: disallow Nikon D6/Compressed processing \* Bug fixed: raw\_inset\_crops[] ctop/cheight was not adjusted right if vendor-specified  ctop equals to 1.
2021-07-20 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Olympus E-P7
2021-07-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Panasonic GH5 Mark II Pentax K3 Mark III several phones w/ DNG files (checked)  \* Camera format support: Panasonic v6/12 bit \* Compile-time raw size limits implemented: LIBRAW\_MAX\_NONDNG\_RAW\_FILE\_SIZE - max file size for non-DNG files (default: 2GB - 1 byte) LIBRAW\_MAX\_DNG\_RAW\_FILE\_SIZE - max DNG file size limit (4GB-1 if compiled w/ DNG SDK, 2GB-1 otherwise)  \* ACES output: color conversion changed to provide D65 white point
 \* Fix for Canon 5D Mark II/sRAW1 incorrect camera provided crop
2021-05-07 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Fujifilm GFX 100S, X-E4: improved color data Canon EOS M50 Mark II was supported but not listed in camera list DJI Mavic Air 2S GOPRO Hero9 \* Support for RaspberryPi HQ camera (if compiled w/ USE\_6BY9RPI) \* Improved support for RPi V1/V2 cameras: - white balance data extraction - color matrix extracted to imgdata.color.cmatrix to use with use\_camera\_matrix. - full-size thumbnail/preview support for JPEG+RAW files (raspistill -r) \* Fuji GFX100/GFX100S: PixelShift metadata extraction. \* RawSpeed (master): fixed bug in old Samsung/compressed decoder, apply this patch to RawSpeed: RawSpeed/rawspeed.samsung-decoder.patch \* DCI-P3 and Rec 2020 output colorspaces \* Eliminated multiple signed/unsigned mismatch warnings (reported by gcc11) \* fixed possible 1-byte stack underrun while handling text tags with zero length \* XMP block size in CR3 files limited to 1MB \* Preview block size in CR3 files limited to 100MB \* Fixed wrong handling of linear DNG files created from Pentax out-of-camera  DNGs
2021-02-18 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Improved Phase One Compressed defects masking, thanks to Alexey Danilchenko \* Sony ILCE-1/Lossless compressed support 2021-02-16 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Additional fields in libraw\_internal\_data.unpacker\_data: - INT64: exif\_offset: base offset of 1st EXIF IFD in file - INT64: ifd0\_offset: base offset of 1st TIFF IFD (IFD0) in file - unsigned cr3\_exif\_length, cr3\_ifd0\_lenght : CR3-specific length of exif and ifd0 sections.
2021-02-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* CRX (CR3) decoder: fixed typo in constant; this does not affect any known still photo (CR3) sample(s), but allows to use the decoder with  some video (CRM) files.
 \* Imported user-contributed improvements to OpenMP postprocessing (AHD and X-Trans demosaic)
 \* Bugfix: overwrite (wrong) TIFF/Orientation tag value with Metadata/Camera Orientation value for EOS 40D only.
2021-02-04 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* imgdata.sizes.raw\_inset\_crop rearranged: now it is imgdata.sizes.raw\_inset\_crops[2]: - item at [0] is the same as imgdatra.sizes.raw\_inset\_crop in previous  versions - item at [1] is 'user crop', in particular: -- set by DNG DefaultUserCrop tag -- or set via raw aspect ratio tags (e.g. 16:9 aspect on Fujifilm cameras) raw\_inset\_crops[1] is filled only if aspect ratio tags provides different aspect ratio compared to raw\_inset\_crops[0].
 There are no flags to check if raw\_inset\_crops[Nth] is filled; to see if it is filled check  the values of: ctop/cleft < 0xffff (0xffff => standard values if not initialized) ctop+cheight <= sizes.raw\_height cleft+cwidth <= sizes.raw\_width
 Note: raw\_inset\_crops may be fooled by metadata (makernotes), use some correctness check before use.
 \* LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_USE\_DNG\_DEFAULT\_CROP processing flag removed, DNG DefaultCrop\* tags are parsed into raw\_inset\_crops[0]
 \* new LibRaw call LibRaw::adjust\_to\_raw\_inset\_crop(unsigned mask, float maxcrop = 0.55f) Promotes imgdata.sizes.raw\_inset\_crops[] values to imgdata.sizes.\*margin and imgdata.sizes.width/height fields
 mask: if bit 1 is set: prefer raw\_inset\_crops[1]  if bit 0 is set: prefer raw\_inset\_crops[0]
 maxcrop: limits crop to not less than (original width/height)\*maxcrop; if raw\_inset\_crops[i] data results in tighter crop, than this item is ignored.
 return value: index in raw\_inset\_crops[] used increased by one, so 0: no changes made 1: [0]th data used 2: [1]th data used  Note: this call SHOULD be used after LibRaw::unpack(), otherwise black level calculation from masked area may be fooled resulting in wrong black levels.
2021-01-21 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
 == LibRaw snapshot 202101 ==
 = Camera format support: = Lossy compressed CR3 files Lossy compressed RAF files Uncompressed floating point DNG files (16-24-32 bit) Deflate compressed striped DNG files XMP and HEIF-preview extraction from CR3 files
 = Camera support = Apple iPhone 12 Max, iPhone 12 Max Pro Canon EOS R5, EOS R6, EOS 850D, EOS-1D X Mark III (lossy compressed files) FujiFilm X-S10 Hasselblad CFV II 50C", Leica M10-R, Q2 Monochrom, S3, SL2-S Nikon Z 5, Z 6 II, Z 7 II Olympus E-M10 Mark IV Panasonic DC-G100 / G110, DC-S5 Sony ILCE-7C (A7C), ILCE-7SM3 (A7S III) Zeiss ZX1 Plus multiple DNG-recording cameraphones/drones/etc.
 = Almost dropped camera support: = Old/partially supported video/cinema cameras support is available only if LibRaw is compiled with USE\_OLD\_VIDEOCAMS defined (this #define is converted internally to LIBRAW\_OLD\_VIDEO\_SUPPORT defined). This affects: Arri cameras Canon C500 RED Cine cameras We plan to keep the support in LibRaw 0.21 (if compiled with define  mentioned above) and completely drop the support after 0.21. If you're using LibRaw to decode RED Cine files, see LibRaw\*datastreams section below (in short: you'll need to use old fstream-based datastream  under Windows). Cinema DNG files are not affected by this.
 = API/ABI changes =
 \* Decoding parameters imgdata.params is split into imgdata.rawparams: parameters used for metadata/raw data decoding imgdata.params: parameters used at postprocessing stage
 imgdata.params.raw\_processing options are split into two sub-options sets imgdata.rawparams.options: raw processing flags, useful for normal  operations imgdata.rawparams.specials: special modes (e.g decoding only delta  pixels from Sony ARW)
 Old LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_\* flags are renamed to LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_\* and  LIBRAW\_RAWSPECIAL\* LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DP2Q\_INTERPOLATE... flags are renamed to  LIBRAW\_RAWSPECIAL\_NODP2Q\_INTERPOLATE with inverted meaning (with the  goal to have zero imgdata.rawparams.specials in normal use).
 \* New processing flag LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_PROVIDE\_NONSTANDARD\_WB If set (default is not), and when applicable, color.cam\_mul[] and color.WB\_Coeffs/WBCT\_Coeffs will contain WB settings for a non-standard workflow. Right now only Sony DSC-F828 is affected: camera-recorded white balance can't be directly applied to raw data because WB is for RGB, while raw data is RGBE.
 \* New processing flag: LIBRAW\_RAWOPTIONS\_CAMERAWB\_FALLBACK\_TO\_DAYLIGHT If set (default is not), LibRaw::dcraw\_process() will fallback to daylight WB (excluding some very specific cases like Canon D30). This is how LibRaw 0.19 (and older) works. If not set: LibRaw::dcraw\_process() will fallback to calculated auto WB if camera WB is requested, but appropriate white balance was not found in metadata.
 \* Removed LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_SKIP\_MAKERNOTES processing flag: with new Windows(-handle) datastreams metadata parsing performance is enough to not skip makernotes parsing.
 \* new output parameter: imgdata.params.output\_flags and new enum LibRaw\_output\_flags Right now the only flag is implemented: LIBRAW\_OUTPUT\_FLAGS\_PPMMETA setting it will result into metadata written to PPM/PGM output file
 \* LibRaw\_\*datastreams change and corresponding open\_file() parameters change LibRaw\_file\_datastream (based on iostreams) is moved under #ifdef LIBRAW\_USE\_DEPRECATED\_IOSTREAMS\_DATASTREAM Standard datastreams are: LibRaw\_bigfile\_datastream (FILE\* based) for POSIX systems LibRaw\_bigfile\_buffered\_datastream - for use with Win32 syscalls API changes: if LIBRAW\_USE\_DEPRECATED\_IOSTREAMS\_DATASTREAM is NOT defined, than  LibRaw::open\_file() and similar calls drops the last INT64 max\_buffered\_sz  parameter which defines automatic selection between iostreams and  FILE\* based datasteams.
 Note: LibRaw\_bigfile\_buffered\_datastream does NOT implements  make\_jas\_stream() call, so RED Cine file decoding is not possible with  this datastream. Use deprecaded iostreams implementation instead.
 We plan to keep LIBRAW\_USE\_DEPRECATED\_IOSTREAMS\_DATASTREAM up to  LibRaw 0.21 and drop in 0.22.
 \* Fuji decoder: fuji\_decode\_loop/fuji\_decode\_strip parameters has changed; look into source code for details if you're implementing your own fuji\_decode\_loop()  call in subclass to provide parallel fuji decoding.
 \* Canon CR3 H265 (HEIF) preview limited support: - new format value: LIBRAW\_THUMBNAIL\_H265 - this thumbnail is NOT extracted by LibRaw::make\_mem\_thumb() yet;
 \* LibRaw::capabilities Two bits added: LIBRAW\_CAPS\_ZLIB if compiled with USE\_ZLIB LIBRAW\_CAPS\_JPEG if compiled with USE\_JPEG
 \* Windows datastreams: CreateFile2 is used if compiled for UWP.
 \* API-datastruct: clarified behavior with use\_camera\_wb=1 setting.
 \* identify(): restored the differentiation between fsize and flen.
 \* New compile-time LIBRAW\_FORCE\_OPENMP to skip compiler version check (if LibRaw user is absolutely sure that OpenMP is supported by compiler)
2020-10-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
 \* LibRaw 0.20.2 Reverted 0.20.1 change: - const buffer for open\_buffer() and open\_bayer() calls Because of 0.20.0 ABI break
2020-10-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
 \* LibRaw 0.20.1 \* Improvements: - exif callback is called on EXIF GPS and EXIF Interop IFDs - open\_bayer call documented - Canon (ColorDatsSubver==32): parse Specular White instead of hardcoded value \* Fixes for normal files processing: - Olympus XZ-1: do not provide linear\_max (it is wrong in metadata) - Nikon Z cameras: added space in camera list - raw-identify: fixed wb-preset print - Pentax Optio 33WR: maker index was incorrect - dcraw\_emu: corrected help line for -6 option. - raw-identify: corrected range check for color matrices print - use\_camera\_matrix option: fixed a bug introduced when making compiler more happy.
 \* Fixes for damaged/special crafted files processing: - Fix for truncated CR3 files parsing - DNG metadata merger: all color loops are limited to MIN(4,colors) - Check for marings: should be less than raw image size - Check for xmpdata present in Samsung Lens ID assignment - Check for column range in leaf\_hdr decoder - Additional checks in Hasselblad model parser - Fuji rotate: better limits check - DNG files: limit tiff\_samples
 \* Not fixes, but makes ASAN/compilers/etc happy: - corrected GPS EXIF output - const buffer for open\_buffer() and open\_bayer() calls
2020-07-23 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
 \* LibRaw 0.20
== Camera Format support == Canon CR3 GoPro (via GPR SDK) Panasonic 14-bit Fujifilm compressed/16bit Rapsberry Pi RAW+JPEG format (if USE\_6BY9RPI defined) Foveon X3F support changed: it is supported only if USE\_X3FTOOLS defined at build (see below for 'Imported code policy changed')
== Camera support (+59, 1131 total) == Canon: PowerShot G5 X Mark II, G7 X Mark III, SX70 HS, EOS R, EOS RP, EOS 90D, EOS 250D, EOS M6 Mark II, EOS M50, EOS M200 EOS 1DX Mark III (lossless files only) DJI Mavic Air, Osmo Action FujiFilm GFX 100, X-A7, X-Pro3, X100V, X-T4 (uncompressed/lossless compressed only), X-T200 GoPro Fusion, HERO5, HERO6, HERO7, HERO8 Hasselblad L1D-20c, X1D II 50C Leica D-LUX7, Q-P, Q2, V-LUX5, C-Lux / CAM-DC25, SL2, M10 Monochrom Nikon D780, Z50, P950 Olympus TG-6, E-M5 Mark III, E-PL10, E-M1 Mark III, Panasonic DC-FZ1000 II, DC-G90, DC-S1, DC-S1R, DC-S1H, DC-TZ95 PhaseOne IQ4 150MP Ricoh GR III Sony A7R IV, A9 II, ILCE-6100, ILCE-6600, RX0 II, RX100 VII Zenit M
also multiple smartphones (the tested ones are listed in LibRaw::cameraList)
== Source code re-arranged == \* dcraw.c is not used in the generation and build processes \* dcraw\_common.cpp and libraw\_cxx.cpp are split into multiple code chunks placed in separate subfolders (decoders/ for raw data decoders, metadata/ for metadata parsers, etc) \* dcraw\_common.cpp and libraw\_cxx.cpp remain to preserve existing build environments (these files are now just a bunch of #include directives). \* It is possible to build LibRaw a)without postprocessing functions (dcraw\_process() and called function) b)without postprocessing and LibRaw::raw2image() call (and called function). It may be useful to reduce library memory/code footprint. See Makefile.devel.nopp and Makefile.devel.noppr2i for the list of source files needed to build reduced/stripped library.
== Normalized make/model ==
There is a huge number of identical cameras sold under different names,depending on the market (e.g. multiple Panasonic or Canon models)and even some identical cameras sold under different brands(Panasonic -> Leica, Sony -> Hasselblad).
To reduce clutter, a normalization mechanism has been implemented in LibRaw:
In imgdata.idata: char normalized\_make[64]; - primary vendor name (e.g. Panasonic for Leica re-branded cameras) char normalized\_model[64]; - primary camera model name unsigned maker\_index; - primary vendor name in indexed form (enum LibRaw\_cameramaker\_index, LIBRAW\_CAMERAMAKER\_\* constant).These fields are always filled upon LibRaw::open\_file()/open\_buffer() calls.
const char\* LibRaw::cameramakeridx2maker(int index): converts maker\_indexto normalized\_make.
We recommend that you use these normalized names in a variety of data tables(color profiles, etc.) to reduce the number of duplicate entries.
New vendor index values will be added strictly to the end of theLibRaw\_cameramaker\_index table, ensuring that the numbers assigned tovendors that are already known to LibRaw will not change.
== DNG frame selection ==
 DNG frames selection code re-worked: - by default all frames w/ the NewSubfileType tag equal to 0 (high-res image) are added to the list of available images (selection performed via imgdata.params.shot\_select field, as usual) - the special case for Fuju SuperCCD (SamplesPerPixel == 2) works as before: shot\_select=1 will extract second sub-image. - Additional flags to imgdata.params.raw\_processing\_options: LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DNG\_ADD\_ENHANCED - will add Enhanced DNG frame (NewSubfileType == 16) to the list of available frames LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DNG\_ADD\_PREVIEWS - will add previews (NewSubfileType == 1) to the list.
 - By default, DNG frames are not reordered and are available in same order as in DNG (LibRaw traverses IFD/Sub-IFD trees in deep-first order). To prioritize the largest image, set LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DNG\_PREFER\_LARGEST\_IMAGE bit in imgdata.params.raw\_processing\_options.
 - DNG Stage2/Stage3 processing via DNG SDK (request via flags in raw\_processing\_options)
== Imported code policy disclaimer ==
 We've changed the policy regarding 3rd party code imported into LibRaw.
 We (like other authors of open-source RAW parsers) gladly import support code for various RAW formats from other projects (if the license allows it). This is done to expand camera support. Unfortunately, not all imported code can tolerate truncated or otherwise damaged raw files, as well as arbitrary conditions or arbitrary data; not all authors handle rejecting unexpected input well.
 LibRaw is now widely used in various projects, including ImageMagick, which, in turn, is often used on web sites to process any input images, including arbitrary data from unknown users. This opens up wide possibilities for exploiting the various vulnerabilities present in the code borrowed from other projects into LibRaw. In order to avoid such security risks, - the borrowed code will no longer compile by default. We are not able to support it in general case, and the authors refuse to add code to reject unexpected input.
 Thus, if you use some kind of camera for which the support is disabled by default, you need to recompile LibRaw for your specific case.
 Formats currently affected: X3F (Foveon) file format. Code is imported from Kalpanika X3F tools: https://github.com/Kalpanika/x3f To turn the support on, define USE\_X3FTOOLS
 Rapsberry Pi RAW+JPEG format. Code is imported from https://github.com/6by9/dcraw/, To turn the support on, define USE\_6BY9RPI Format support is indicated via LibRaw::capabilities() call with flags: LIBRAW\_CAPS\_X3FTOOLS - Foveon support LIBRAW\_CAPS\_RPI6BY9 - RPi RAW+JPEG support
== GoPro .gpr format support == GoPro format supported via open-source GPR SDK See README.GoPro.txt for details.
== Windows support/Windows unicode (wchar\_t\*) filenames support ==
\* (old) LibRaw's WIN32 external define split into 3 defines to fine tune compiler/api compatibility: LIBRAW\_WIN32\_DLLDEFS - use to compile DLLs (\_\_dllimport/\_\_dllexport attributes) LIBRAW\_WIN32\_UNICODEPATHS - indicates that runtime has calls/datatypes for wchar\_t filenames LIBRAW\_WIN32\_CALLS - use Win32 calls where appropriative (binary mode for files, LibRaw\_windows\_datastream, \_snprintf instead of snprintf, etc).
 If the (old) WIN32 macro is defined at compile time, all three new defines are defined in libraw.h If not, these defines are defined based on compiler version/libc++ defines
\* LibRaw::open\_file(wchar\_t\*) is always compiled in under Windows, but if LIBRAW\_WIN32\_UNICODEPATHS (see above) is not defined, this call will return LIBRAW\_NOT\_IMPLEMENTED. Use (LibRaw::capabilities() & LIBRAW\_CAPS\_UNICODEPATHS) on runtime to check that this call was really implemented (or check for #ifdef LIBRAW\_WIN32\_UNICODEPATHS after #include <libraw.h>)
== LibRaw\*datastream simplified ==
 \* tempbuffer\_open, subfile\_open are not used, so removed from LibRaw\_abstract\_datastream and derived classes.
 \* jpeg\_src() call implemented using ->read() call and own buffering (16k buffer). \* buffering\_off() call added. It should be used in derived classes to switch from buffered reads to unbuffered.
== minor/unsorted changes == \* new flag LIBRAW\_WARN\_DNGSDK\_PROCESSED to indicate decoder used \* LibRaw::open() call, max\_buf\_size special meaning: == 1 => open using bigfile\_datastream == 2 => open using file\_datastream \* Add support for zlib during configure \* Fixed multiple problems found by OSS-Fuzz \* Lots of changes in imgdata.makernotes (hope someone will document it) \* DNG SDK could be used (if enabled) to unpack multi-image DNG files. \* DNG whitelevel calculated via BitsPerSample if not set via tags. \* DNG: support for LinearDNG w/ BlackLevelRepeat.. pattern \* Generic Arri camera format replaced w/ list of specific camera models in supported cameras list. \* new samples/rawtextdump sample: allows one to dump (small selection) of RAW data in text format. \* samples/raw-identify: \* +M/-M params (same as in dcraw\_emu) \* -L <file-w-filelist> parameter to get file list from a file \* -m paramerer to use mmap'ed IO. \* -t parameter for timing \* samples/dcraw\_emu: fixed +M handling \* better support for Nikon Coolscan 16-bit NEF files. \* Visual Studio project files: re-generated to .vcxproj (Visual Studio 2019), different intermediate folders for different sub-projects to allow 1-step rebuild. \* imgdata.makernotes...cameraspecific: removed the vendor name prefix from variables. \* Bayer images: ensure that even margins have the same COLOR() for both the active sensor area and the full sensor area. \* raw processing flag bit LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_CHECK\_DNG\_ILLUMINANT inverted and renamed to LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DONT\_CHECK\_DNG\_ILLUMINANT. If not set, DNG illuminant will be checked. \* New libraw\_decoder\_t flags: LIBRAW\_DECODER\_FLATDATA - in-file data could be used as is (if byte order matches), e.g. via mmap() LIBRAW\_DECODER\_FLAT\_BG2\_SWAPPED - special flag for Sony ARQ: indicates R-G-G2-B channel order in 4-color data \* Camera-recorded image crop data is parsed into imgdata.sizes.raw\_inset\_crop structure: ctop,cleft,cwidth,cheight - crop size. aspect - LibRawImageAspects enum (3to2, 4to3, etc) \* New define LIBRAW\_NO\_WINSOCK2 to not include winsock2.h on compile
 \* New processing flag LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_PROVIDE\_NONSTANDARD\_WB If set (default is not), and when applicable, color.cam\_mul[] and color.WB\_Coeffs/WBCT\_Coeffs will contain WB settings for a non-standard workflow. Right now only Sony DSC-F828 is affected: camera-recorded white balance can't be directly applied to raw data because WB is for RGB, while raw data is RGBE.
 \* New processing flag: LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_CAMERAWB\_FALLBACK\_TO\_DAYLIGHT If set (default is not), LibRaw::dcraw\_process() will fallback to daylight WB (excluding some very specific cases like Canon D30). This is how LibRaw 0.19 (and older) works. If not set: LibRaw::dcraw\_process() will fallback to calculated auto WB if camera WB is requested, but appropriate white balance was not found in metadata.
 \* Google changes cherry-picked (thanks to Jamie Pinheiro) \* speedup: ppg interpolate: const loop invariant
 \* Bugs fixed -Fixed several UBs found by OSS Fuzz -Fixed several problems found by other fuzzers. - Thumbnail size range check (CVE-2020-15503) Thanks to Jennifer Gehrke of Recurity Labs GmbH for problem report. - fixed possible overflows in canon and sigma makernotes parsers - fixed possible buffer overrun in crx (cr3) decoder - fixed memory leak in crx decoder (if compiled with LIBRAW\_NO\_CR3\_MEMPOOL) - fixed possible overrun in Sony SRF and SR2 metadata parsers
 \* Fixed typo in longitude (member of parsed GPS structure), update required for code that uses it.
2019-03-05 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support Canon A560 (CHDK hack) FujiFilm X-T30 Nikon Coolpix A1000 Olympus E-M1X Sony ILCE-6400 Several dng files from phones and drones was tested and added to built-in camera list too.
 \* Multiple names for same Panasonic cameras are processed via aliaces mechanics, no multiple duplicate fields in adobe\_coeffs() table
 \* Better makernotes parsing for many cameras
 \* Better parsing of makernotes embedded into DNG files created by Adobe DNG Converter
 \* New imgdata.params.raw\_processing\_options value: LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_ZEROFILTERS\_FOR\_MONOCHROMETIFFS - If this bit is set - and TIFF file contains SamplesPerPixel == 1 - and filters value was not guessed from metadata parsing LibRaw will assume the file is monochrome, not bayer. This option is needed for monochrome scan processing (Imacon X1 etc). This option may broke old TIF-like RAW files processing (Kodak 760,etc) use with care (it is better to let user choose).
2018-12-12 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Camera support: Canon: PowerShot A480 (CHDK hack), EOS 2000D, EOS 4000D Eyedeas E1 FujiFilm: GFX 50R, XF10, X-T3, X-T100, DBP680 GITUP G3 DUO (16:9 mode only, use custom camera for 4:3) Kodak PIXPRO AZ901 Leica M10-D, M10-P Nikon D3500, Z6, Z7, P1000 Panasonic LX100M2 Pentax K-1 II Sony A7 III, HX95, HX99, RX100-VA, RX100-VI
 \* Fixed long standing bug in remove\_zeroes: first two rows/cols was unprocessed \* Better parsing for NEF files modified (damaged) by NikonTransfer \* Better parsing for floating point DNG black levels (into color.dnglevels.fblack and dng\_fcblack[], similar to color.black and color.cblack[] for other formats). \* More flexible limit for RAW decoding memory usage: imgdata.params.max\_raw\_memory\_mb (default is LIBRAW\_MAX\_ALLOC\_MB\_DEFAULT)
 \* New flags for imgdata.params.raw\_processing\_options: LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_CHECK\_DNG\_ILLUMINANT - will check DNG illuminant field when selecting color matrix (note: incompatibility with previous versions, so default is not set). LIBRAW\_PROCESSING\_DNGSDK\_ZEROCOPY - will not copy data from Adobe DNG SDK decoded buffer, but use it as is
 \* Switched from auto\_ptr to unique\_ptr, to get back define LIBRAW\_USE\_AUTOPTR
 \* dcraw\_emu: it is now possible to create output filename in a more flexible manner, via -Z switch: -Z - will output to stdout -Z ext will output into inputfilename.ext -Z .ext will output into inputfilename.inputext.ext
2018-11-22 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru> \* Finally: got Sinar 4shot sample, works fine now \* OpenMP critical sections for malloc/free; extra #ifdefs removed; bin/dcraw\_dist could be built again using Makefile.devel \* additional checks in parse\_phase\_one() \* more checks on file offsets/tag len in parse\_minolta \* more checks in parse\_ciff \* Mempool check reworked \* Old Leaf (16bit/3color/TIFF) support \* Fix cameraWB->autoWB fallback \* Polaroid x530 channel swap; get metadata pointer for Foveon files \* Fixed Secunia Advisory SA86384 - possible infinite loop in unpacked\_load\_raw() - possible infinite loop in parse\_rollei() - possible infinite loop in parse\_sinar\_ia() Credits: Laurent Delosieres, Secunia Research at Flexera
