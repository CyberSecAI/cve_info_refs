    "details": [
      {
        "type": "description",
        "value": "The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow READ 8 that occurs in `js::WasmTableObject::getImpl` when accessing a WebAssembly table element using an index that is out of bounds. Specifically, this happens when the table has a length of zero, leading to an underflow when `table.length() - 1` is calculated, which is used to access the table. This underflow results in out-of-bounds memory access."
