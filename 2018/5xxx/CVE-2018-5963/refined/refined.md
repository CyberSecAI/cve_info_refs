Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2018-5963:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the "title" parameter in the `admin/addbookmark.php` script of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) version 2.2.5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (the 'title' parameter) before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Gaining complete control of an admin account if admin falls victim to the exploit

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `admin/addbookmark.php` endpoint, specifically via the `title` parameter. An attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `title` field and submits a POST request. The injected script gets stored and executed when the page where the bookmark is displayed is loaded.
    - POST request to `/cmsms-2.2.5-install/admin/addbookmark.php` with a crafted `title` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative access to the CMS Made Simple admin interface to add a bookmark.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `admin/addbookmark.php`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application retrieves and renders the unsanitized title from the database.
- The provided proof of concept uses the following payload in the `title` parameter: `%27%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert%281%29%3E` which translates to `'"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Kyaw Min Thein.
- The vendor was notified but stated they would not give bounties for using admin permissions.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2018-5963 by MITRE on January 22, 2018.
