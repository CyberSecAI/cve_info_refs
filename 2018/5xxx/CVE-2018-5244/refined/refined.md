Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-5244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in Xen 4.10 and later due to a failure to free a tracking structure when a virtual CPU (vcpu) is destroyed. This was introduced as part of an overhaul to MSR (Model Specific Register) emulation for guests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: An 8-byte memory allocation is leaked each time a vcpu is destroyed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious guest can repeatedly reboot, causing the system to run out of memory over time.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a guest user capable of rebooting their virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be on a vulnerable system running Xen 4.10 or later on an x86 architecture.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects only x86 systems; ARM systems are not vulnerable.
- All guest types can exploit this vulnerability.
- Mitigation strategies involve limiting guest reboot frequency or periodically rebooting the host to reclaim leaked memory.
- A patch is available to resolve the vulnerability.
