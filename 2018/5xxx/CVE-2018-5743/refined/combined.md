**Abstract**

CVE-2018-5743 allows remote attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks via a susceptible version of DNS Server.

DNS Server is not affected by CVE-2019-6467 and CVE-2019-6468 as these vulnerabilities only affect ISC BIND 9.10.5 and later.

**Affected Products**

| Product | Severity | Fixed Release Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS Server | Important | Upgrade to 9.11.23-6069 or above. |

**Mitigation**

None

**Detail**

* CVE-2018-5743

  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 7.5
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
  + By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5743.
* CVE-2019-6467

  + Severity: Not affected
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 0.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N)
  + A programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone that is served locally. The most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring to provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible. Versions affected: BIND 9.12.0-> 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases in the 9.13 development branch.
* CVE-2019-6468

  + Severity: Not affected
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 0.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N)
  + In BIND Supported Preview Edition, an error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can occur in versions which support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) features. In those versions which have ECS support, enabling nxdomain-redirect is likely to lead to BIND exiting due to assertion failure. Versions affected: BIND Supported Preview Edition version 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.5-S5. ONLY BIND Supported Preview Edition releases are affected.
