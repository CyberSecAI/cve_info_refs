  "CVE-2018-5147": {
    "Description": "The libtremor library has the same flaw as CVE-2018-5146. This library is used by Firefox in place of libvorbis on Android and ARM platforms.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds memory write in the codebook parsing code of the Libtremor multimedia library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds write in `vorbis_book_decodev_add` function within `libtremor`.",
       "The vulnerability occurs when parsing vorbis audio formats within the `vorbis_book_decodev_add` function. The loop condition within this function is flawed and allows the index 'i' to exceed the intended boundaries leading to an out of bounds memory write."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory via a malformed Vorbis file",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Processing of malformed Vorbis audio files."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide or trick a user into opening a crafted Vorbis audio file."
