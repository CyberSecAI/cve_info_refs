However, use-after-free vulnerabilities are generally triggered by manipulating program execution flows to access memory that has already been freed. This is often achieved via specially crafted files or network data that triggers the vulnerable code path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make the vulnerable Adobe Acrobat or Reader application process a specially crafted input (likely a malicious PDF file), leading to the use-after-free condition.
