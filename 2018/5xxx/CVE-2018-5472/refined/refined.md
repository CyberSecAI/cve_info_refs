Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to permissions, privileges, and access controls within the Philips IntelliSpace Portal (ISP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is improper access control. The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed, but it is grouped with other CVEs in the category of "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls."  The issues allow an attacker to potentially:
* Gain unauthorized access to the system
* Escalate privileges
* Execute arbitrary code

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the access control vulnerabilities could lead to:
* Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
* Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher levels of access and control.
* Execution of arbitrary code, potentially allowing an attacker to install malware, disrupt services, or compromise data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is not explicitly mentioned as remote or local for CVE-2018-5472, but other vulnerabilities within the same product can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to have some level of access to the Philips IntelliSpace Portal system, but the exact level is not specified. It is likely that the attacker would need to be on the same network as the vulnerable system. The advisory states that "an attacker with low skill would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities," suggesting that the exploits themselves are not complex, once access is gained.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all 8.0.x and 7.0.x versions of Philips IntelliSpace Portal.
*   Philips is creating a software update to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Mitigating controls are available for some vulnerabilities on the Philips InCenter portal.
*   The vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities with CVEs: CVE-2018-5468, CVE-2017-0199, and CVE-2005-1794
*   CVSS v3 base scores range from 6.4 to 7.8 for this group of vulnerabilities.
