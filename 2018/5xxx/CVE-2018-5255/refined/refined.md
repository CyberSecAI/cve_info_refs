**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation) agent on Arista EOS (Extensible Operating System) devices may crash unexpectedly when processing malformed UDP packets on a specific UDP port destined to the switch's IP address. The vulnerability lies in the handling of malformed UDP heartbeat packets by the `MlagShared.py` script during the validation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of UDP heartbeat packets. Specifically, the `struct.unpack` operation in `MlagShared.py` fails when processing malformed header data.
- Lack of adequate input sanitization on the specified UDP port.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected restart of the MLAG agent, potentially leading to a momentary disruption in traffic forwarding.
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to repeated crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted, malformed UDP packets with specific port numbers to the switch's IP address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network traffic to the affected switch.
- Knowledge of the specific UDP port number and the format of the malformed UDP packets that trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any specific access or privileges on the switch itself to trigger the vulnerability.
