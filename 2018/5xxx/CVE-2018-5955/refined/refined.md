{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Unsanitized argument passed to an exec function call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to unsanitized input.",
      "Lack of input validation when handling user-provided data"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running GitStack.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP requests to the `/web/index.php` endpoint with a crafted 'authorization' header containing the malicious payload",
        "Exploitation of the vulnerability via the web interface of GitStack"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GitStack server. The attacker needs a valid username or must create one."
  },
  "additional_notes": [
    "The exploit module is designed to automatically enable the web interface if it is disabled, create a repository and user if necessary, then execute the payload. After exploitation, it will revert the changes it made if necessary (disabling the web interface, removing the repo, etc.).",
    "The module uses basic authentication to pass the payload in the password field.",
    "The vulnerability exists in GitStack through v2.3.10.",
    "The Metasploit module provides a reliable way to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "The vulnerability is triggered by accessing /web/index.php with specific parameters and a malicious authorization header."
