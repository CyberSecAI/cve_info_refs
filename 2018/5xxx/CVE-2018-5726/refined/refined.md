Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5726:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2018-5726 is the lack of authentication for accessing sensitive information via the `param.cgi` script on the affected Master IP CAM 01 device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to access the `getuser` command through the `param.cgi` script without any authentication. This allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information, likely including user credentials or other device-related data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve potentially sensitive information about the IP camera by sending an unauthenticated request to the `/web/cgi-bin/hi3510/param.cgi?cmd=getuser` endpoint. This information could be used for further attacks or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack vector is through the network. An attacker needs to send an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the IP camera on the network. No prior authentication is required.
