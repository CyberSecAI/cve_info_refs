    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability arises from an inconsistency in how BIND servers handle TSIG keys, potentially leading to server instability or crashes. This can be triggered by a crafted DNS message, requiring knowledge of a TSIG key.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an inconsistency in the processing of TSIG keys within BIND. Specifically, a specially crafted message using a known (or guessed) TSIG key can cause a BIND server to enter an inconsistent state. In versions of BIND from March 2018 and later, an assertion check in tsig.c was introduced to detect this state and force the server to exit, preventing further operation in an inconsistent state.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inconsistent state handling in BIND when processing TSIG keys",
		"Lack of input validation on TSIG messages"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, by exploiting the inconsistency in TSIG processing and forcing a BIND server to exit.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network - Attacker sends a crafted DNS message to the vulnerable BIND server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must either know or be able to guess the name of a TSIG key that the BIND server uses. By default, BIND configures a local session key, making almost all current BIND servers vulnerable if not patched."
