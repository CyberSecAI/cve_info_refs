The provided content is related to CVE-2018-5552.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses a static, hard-coded cryptographic salt for encryption and decryption routines.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a hard-coded cryptographic salt. The salt `S@l+&pepper` is embedded in the .NET Framework installer.
- The salt is not unique per installation, making decryption easier for an attacker if they gain access to encrypted data.
- The end user is neither informed of the existence of this salt, nor given the opportunity to change it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If an attacker obtains encrypted data and knows the static salt, they can decrypt the data.
- The specific data encrypted using this salt is not identified in the report, however it's noted that it could expose "confidential information"

**Attack vectors:**
- Static analysis of the DTISQLInstaller.exe file reveals the hard-coded salt.
- An attacker would need access to the encrypted data and the static salt to decrypt it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the DTISQLInstaller.exe file to extract the salt via static analysis.
- Access to the encrypted data generated by the application that was encrypted using the hardcoded salt.
