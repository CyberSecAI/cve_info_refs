<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/printing/ipc/RemotePrintJobParent.cpp?q=RemotePrintJobParent%3A%3APrintPage&redirect_type=single#100-127>
Is the relevant code, it accepts a path from the content process and then opens it up. On macOS at least, the content process can write a symlink into that directory, causing it to open an arbitrary file on disk.
It looks like the expected format of the the file is a custom binary format, so this probably can't be used to leak the full contents of arbitrary files, but it needs closer inspection: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/printing/PrintTranslator.cpp?q=%2Bfunction%3A%22mozilla%3A%3Alayout%3A%3APrintTranslator%3A%3ATranslateRecording%28std%3A%3Aistream+%26%29%22&redirect_type=single#28>
Unfortunately I haven't found a way to use the macOS sandboxing policy language to disallow creating symlinks. I'm going to file a bug with apple requesting it. Therefore any place the chrome process opens up paths in the content process's temporary directory, it needs to validate that they aren't symlinks -- my understanding (correct if wrong!) is that printing is the only place we do this. (I wonder if we should instead generate a pipe-pair and send the content process the write end, to avoid needing to read from this path on disk in chrome).
(I put this bug in sandboxing, but maybe it belongs in printing?) I believe this should be sec-low or sec-moderate (it only really affects nightly because the sandbox doesn't prevent filesystem access directly on other release channels!)

It also looks like passing a non-existant file path will cause |PrintTranslator::TranslateRecording| to read uninitialized memory.

Yes opening the files in the parent and passing down the handle, was something I wanted to look into here.
I think on Windows symlinks can only be created by Administrator.
I guess using a pipe essentially does the same thing?
Would there be size limitations here though?

I agree that it would be good to check that the file exists (along with the symlink check for MacOS and linux, although doesn't hurt on Windows as well). Better still to pass down some Handle/FD from the parent, if not too difficult.
However, I think if the file doesn't exist the ifstream will just fail to open and subsequent reads will fail.
This does mean that magicInt will remain uninitialised, but it would then almost certainly fail the following check.
If not there in the next checks or the call to good().
We could initialize it anyway, to make sure, given ReadElement doesn't indicate failure (not quite sure why that is).
When you say "read uninitialised memory" do you mean this uint32\_t (magicInt)?

How could this leak the contents of files, wouldn't that need the parent process to pass something back to the child for it to read?
The main risk here is an attack on the parent process I think, but the child can already write whatever it wants into this file.
This is all somewhat mitigated by the fact that you have to convince someone to print first before the attack.

It's the only case that I know for sure, I think we might write to it for some crash reporting data.
I know we create temporary files for media (for the cache I think) and blobs, but they are created in the parent [1].
We might be able to use this for printing or at least some of the code for a parent driven version of it.
One complication is that I'm not sure how easy it is to create an ofstream from an FD.
Although it looks like there have been some changes to further abstract the stream required for the recording.

Thanks for looking at this code by the way. :-)
It's definitely an area for concern as a possible route for exploits, so it's great to get more eyes on it.

Yes, when I said "read initialized memory", I was talking about |magicInt|, I don't know how seriously we consider uninitialized-stack-reads.
As for how it could leak the contents of the files, I don't \_think\_ it can. If the results were put in some file readable by content, that'd be a problem (for files properly formatted in this graphs serialization file, heh). I suppose if you physically printed the symlinked-to-file that'd be an interesting attack :-)
Agreed that the best way to resolve is to switch to passing around a handle/fd instead a filename. (Do we have a document anywhere that lists all the places that use content temp?)
a) Is there someone from a printing/gfx team we should add to this bug?
b) Is there good prior art to look at for passing the handle/fd to the child?

Not that I am aware of.

Maybe jwatt (added) at least so he's aware, as he's been dealing with a fair amount of printing stuff.

That code I mentioned does it, if you look at AnonymousTemporaryFileRequestor.
I think haik might also have done something similar for the webext change, but he might have used existing functionality.
Getting the handle might be the easy part, we probably need to think about how we use it in the child first before we go too far down that road.

For the moz-extension remoting, there are two ways the file access is remoted. One uses AutoIPCStream and the other sends a bare FD to the child.
When the child is requesting a single non-JAR file from the parent, we use an AutoIPCStream. ExtensionProtocolHandler::NewStream() returns a FileInputStream to NeckoParent::RecvGetExtensionStream() and the Necko code creates an AutoIPCStream to send to the child. The child can then read from the input stream it receives. The AutoIPCStream implementation actually passes the FD to the child so data is \_not\_ streamed over IPC. See the comments on AutoIPCStream: <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5dadcbe55b4ddd1e448c06c77390ff6483aa009b/ipc/glue/IPCStreamUtils.h#123> This seems like a good possibility.
The other way is when the child is requesting a JAR file FD from the parent, we use the FileDescriptor IPDL type in a new Necko IPDL message which handles IPC serialization and "just works". In ExtensionProtocolHandler::NewFD(), the parent opens an existing file and gets its FD to send to the child. The child then creates an nsIFile using the received FD (which is slightly ugly because the nsIFile implementation FileDescriptorFile doesn't support all the nsIFile methods.)
:baku has done a lot of work to make this streamlined and might have a better recommendation.

The symlink part of this is addressed by 1379803 - assuming that Windows and Linux are also able to lock out symlinks.

Even with 1379803, I think it would be good for the parent to make sure it's not getting a symlink (assuming we don't change the code to use FD's only) providing some defense in depth.

On Linux this might also apply to hard links, but I don't think we need to allow link() at all — the only thing we saw using it was an input method plugin, and we stopped loading those in content processes because they don't directly handle input events.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/swnav.html>
2. Now go to <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/iframer.php?url=//www.bing.com/images/search?q=Edge>
3. Open developer tools and click on any error.
Actual results:
Resources required to show error details are fetched through service worker registered on <https://vuln.shhnjk.com/swnav.html>. Leaking cross-origin information.
Attaching PoC video since it might be difficult to repro.
Expected results:
Developer tool's traffic should not go thought service worker.

Okay, this issue is caused by Style Editor in Developer tool. You only need to open Style Editor to trigger the bug.

I can confirm that due to this bug the ServiceWorker sees the URLs for resources in cross-origin iframes.
These resources are fetched by the DevTools and should bypass the ServiceWorker.

I believe this is a devtools bug. They should be setting nsIChannel::LOAD\_BYPASS\_SERVICE\_WORKER on their network requests.

Or alternatively, the network requests need to be made from the iframes document context and not the top window's context. That will ensure the iframe's service worker (if any) sees the request but not the top level service worker.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1408708&attachment=8920262)

This seems to fix it, but to be honest I don't quite follow the issue.
Aren't we going to be confused in some other cases, do we \*always\* expect to bypass service workers in all type of ressources displayed by DevTools?
And I imagine we should review everything to ensure we don't do another request like this.
Many codes now use fetch(), but we may still have custom request code somewhere else...

After thinking about this, [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408708#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Developer tool's traffic routes through service worker") might be better. Ideally we would use the same service worker used to load the resources for content.
Can you tell if the top level window is being passed instead of the iframe window for any of these fetches?

Ok, that makes more sense to me.
Here we ensure using StyleSheet document (here an iframe) intead of top level document we debug.
Still, we would have to review all our code to ensure we don't have this issue somewhere else.

Good catch!
\* So. It looks like some other code would suffer from the same issue:
<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1c4da216e00ac95b38a3f236e010b31cdfaae03b/devtools/server/actors/source.js#382-391>
let win = this.threadActor.\_parent.window;
...
let webNav = win.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIInterfaceRequestor)
.getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation);
let channel = webNav.currentDocumentChannel;
principal = channel.loadInfo.loadingPrincipal;
...
let sourceFetched = fetch(this.url, {
principal,
...
});
Also, is principal enough?
When we pass this `principal` attribute we end up setting it like this:
channelOptions.loadingPrincipal = principal;
When we pass a `window`, we also do this:
channel.loadGroup = window.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIInterfaceRequestor)
.getInterface(Ci.nsIWebNavigation)
.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIDocumentLoader)
.loadGroup;
\* We may also have issue on source map, but is sourcemap suffering from the same issue??

Can you include a regression test for this? Seems you could register a SW for a nested cross-origin iframe that populates the body with something and then verify both content and devtools see the same value?

Patrick, I had to tweak the cases where it isn't easy to retrieve stylesheet's document.
And also contributed a non-trivial test to cover this.

patch v6
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It involves having devtools opened, so I would not say it is easy.
Here, you have to have the style editor opened.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I'm not sure I get this question. bulls-eye?
The test very specificaly test this particular issue.
But the check-in and comments only say what we are doing and are not really highlighting a particular security issue.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
mozilla-release branch is affected, so all supported branches are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I haven't checked, but the files I'm modifying aren't actively modified, so it should be easy to backport.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It may affect inspector and style editor, so it would be great to have these panel tested. But devtools don't have QA smoketest.

What about ESR-52 branch? That's really the point of the question since the whole point of ESR is supporting people with security fixes.
Since this requires a victim to open dev tools and click on error links I'm lowering the severity to moderate.Flags: needinfo?(poirot.alex)Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Service workers are disabled on ESR. So its not an issue there.Flags: needinfo?(poirot.alex)

BTW, as I said in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408708#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Developer tool's traffic routes through service worker"), opening style editor is the right repro and victim doesn't have to click on error.

Attached patch

[patch v7](attachment.cgi?id=8935031&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8935031&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1408708&attachment=8935031)

Sorry, this bug dropped off my radar.
Looks like DevToolsUtils had an issue with requests coming from SW when running in non-e10s.
Patrick, please have a look at the new change in DevToolsUtils.
Accessing `nsIChannel.contentCharset` throws when accessing it for a request served
by a Service worker. That, only when running on non-e10s.
I didn't saw that first as we run non-e10s tests only on windows debug builds and I'm pushing to try only on linux.

patch v8
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
Probably has always been around.
[User impact if declined]:
Leak cross origin information when a Service worker is involved \*and\* the style editor is opened.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Yes, most of the complexity of this patch comes from its test. The fix itself is quite simple.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
Not yet by QA.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
Would be great, [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408708#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Developer tool's traffic routes through service worker") describes a good STR.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
None
[Is the change risky?]:
No
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
Limited to DevTools, this code is only used by style editor and inspector.
The patch looks quite simple.
[String changes made/needed]:
NoneFlags: needinfo?(poirot.alex)

For security issues we normally don't land the tests until after the bug is un-hidden.
But, since they are already on trunk, may as well bring this to beta (should be in beta 11 or 12)

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

#### [#CVE-2018-5107: Printing process will follow symlinks for local file access](#CVE-2018-5107)

Reporter
Alex Gaynor
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The printing process can bypass local access protections to read files available through symlinks, bypassing local file restrictions. The printing process requires files in a specific format so arbitrary data cannot be read but it is possible that some local file information could be exposed.

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

#### [#CVE-2018-5109: Audio capture prompts and starts with incorrect origin attribution](#CVE-2018-5109)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An audio capture session can started under an incorrect origin from the site making the capture request. Users are still prompted to allow the request but the prompt can display the wrong origin, leading to user confusion about which site is making the request to capture an audio stream.

#### [#CVE-2018-5111: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop](#CVE-2018-5111)

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
