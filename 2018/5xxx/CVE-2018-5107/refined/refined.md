Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the Firefox printing process. The chrome process (parent process) reads a file path from the content process (child process) to access a file for printing. However, it does not validate whether the provided path is a symbolic link (symlink). On macOS and Linux systems, this allows the content process to create a symlink in its temporary directory that points to an arbitrary file on the disk. When the chrome process attempts to read the file using the path provided, it can be tricked into opening an unintended target due to the symlink, violating the intended sandboxing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Following:** The primary weakness is the chrome process blindly following symlinks provided by the content process. This bypasses intended file access restrictions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The chrome process does not validate the type of the file path received from the content process, specifically not checking for symlinks.
*   **Reading File Paths from Untrusted Sources:** The chrome process directly uses file paths received from a less privileged content process, which is susceptible to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker, through the content process, can make the chrome process open arbitrary local files via symlinks. While the printing process requires data in a custom binary format, it might be possible to craft the symlink and printing data to expose some information from a local file.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Although not directly resulting in privilege escalation, by being able to read arbitrary files, an attacker could be able to gain access to sensitive data such as configuration files or other information not intended to be accessed by the content process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious website or content running in a Firefox tab (the content process) could create a symlink within its temporary directory.
*   The malicious content would then initiate a print request.
*   The printing process would receive the file path from the content process, and due to the symlink, would attempt to read a file outside the content process's permitted area.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to run JavaScript code within a Firefox tab (i.e., a malicious website or crafted content).
*  **Exploit Specific to Printing Process:** An attacker needs knowledge of the Firefox printing mechanism to create a symlink that can lead to information disclosure. This means they need to be able to trigger a print action.
*   **No user interaction** beyond visiting the website.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by sandboxing on release channels other than nightly.
*   The fix involved changes in bug 1319423, which seems to have moved to using handles/FDs instead of filepaths.
*   The bug report also mentions an uninitialized memory read vulnerability in `PrintTranslator::TranslateRecording` if the specified file does not exist, although this appears secondary to the primary issue.
*   The bug was classified as `sec-moderate`.
*   The issue was resolved by moving to a safer method of inter-process communication for printing, by passing a handle/fd instead of a file path.
