{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability of a web page to initiate the opening of local files and folders through a drag-and-drop event. Specifically, when a user drags a specially crafted text string (resembling a file path) from a web page and drops it onto the browser's address bar, the browser interprets this string as a local file path and attempts to open it, bypassing security restrictions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Improper handling of drag-and-drop events",
    "Insufficient validation of dropped content in the address bar",
    "Failure to correctly distinguish between URLs and local file paths during drag-and-drop operations."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when its content is dragged and dropped into the address bar, leads to the opening of arbitrary local files or folders on the user's system. This could potentially expose sensitive data or allow an attacker to execute malicious files, depending on the user's system configuration and permissions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious web page displays a crafted text string that resembles a local file path, the user drags the text string and drops it into the address bar or tab bar.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page, and rely on user interaction to drag content from the page and drop it into the address bar or tab bar."
