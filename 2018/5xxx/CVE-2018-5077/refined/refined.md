The provided content details multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the "Advanced Real Estate Script".

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Input validation is missing or inadequate in several administrative functionalities, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code into various fields.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data in multiple fields such as "keyword", "contact", "cast", "moviename", "snacks_name", and "newstitle".
    *   The application directly renders user-provided data without proper encoding or sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when an administrator views the affected pages.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the admin, steal session cookies, or deface the admin panel.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious scripts using the identified vulnerable parameters of the POST requests.
    *   The crafted POST requests must be submitted when creating or editing the affected entities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious POST requests.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.

**Specific XSS examples:**
    *   XSS1: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/sitesettings.php` with `keyword` parameter.
    *   XSS2: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/manageownerlist.php?edit&usrid=51` with `contact` parameter.
    *   XSS3: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/eventlist.php?edit&eventid=45` with `cast` parameter.
    *   XSS4: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/movieedit.php?movieid=134` with `moviename` parameter.
    *   XSS5: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/snacks_edit.php?sid=8` with `snacks_name` parameter.
    *  XSS6: `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/newsedit.php?newsid=7` with `newstitle` parameter.

**CSRF Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms on the admin panel, specifically when submitting forms.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to verify that a request is originating from a legitimate user session and not a malicious attacker.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to unknowingly perform actions like modifying movie details or other sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can host a malicious page containing the required POST request.
    *   When a logged-in admin visits the page, the malicious POST request is submitted to the vulnerable application.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to host or distribute a malicious HTML page
    *  Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and expected structure of POST request.
    *   The attacker relies on a logged in administrator to visit the malicious page.

**Specific CSRF example:**
  * The provided HTML page demonstrates a CSRF attack targeting `http://198.38.86.159/~dineshkumarwork/demo/movie/admin/movieedit.php?movieid=134`, which modifies the "moviename" parameter.
