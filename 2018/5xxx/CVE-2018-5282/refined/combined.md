Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local

Severity Level:
===============
High

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local stack buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official Kentico v9.0, v10.0 & v11.0 content management system software.
The buffer overflow vulnerability allows local attackers to compromise the local system process by an overwrite of the active registers.

The local buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the `Load XML Configuration` module for file imports. The xml file impact input
data of the configuration for the software. In several values of the xml file the inputs are not recognized by an approval of the secure
software validation mechanism. The iis configuration settings are connected to a secure validation process, the sql install database
information in the xml file are not. The non-exisiting input validation and the unrestricted context size allows local attackers to
trigger a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. That results in compromise of the software process with system privileges.

The security risk of the local buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0.
Exploitation of the stack buffer overflow vulnerability requires a low privilege or restricted system user account without user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in overwrite of the active registers to compromise of the computer system or process.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Load XML Configuration

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privileged or restricted system user account without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the software vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue the process.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Download the newst software version of the Kentico cms (v9.0.x - 9.0.5981.23486)
2. Accept the program conditions and click to custom installation
3. Open the local hosted xml poc file
4. Include a large unicode payload to the marked values
5. Save the xml file on your localhost
6. Move back to the kentico v9.x installation process with the custom install screen
Note: Attach a debugger to followup with the overwrite on the active registers
7. Load the xml poc file by usage of the import function of kentico (left|buttom)
8. The vulnerable values loaded and the process will permanently crash with different exceptions
9. Move back to the debugger that is attached to the active software process and followup with an overwrite of the active ecx, ebp or eip registers
10. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability!

Note: Start the software exe file kentico v9.0 on windows, attach the windows debugger and load the xml config file to overwrite the ecx and eip registers.
The installation path and the iis website values are not exploitable, because of the active content restrictions of the process that drops an invalid
argument exception to prevent.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure file size and input character restriction like on the iis scheme website input.
Parse the full xml file on import and restrict the memory size on imports to prevent further buffer overflow attacks.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the kentico cms software is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.0)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local stack buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official Kentico v9.0, v10.0 & v11.0 content management system software.
The buffer overflow vulnerability allows local attackers to compromise the local system process by an overwrite of the active registers.
The local buffer overflow vulnerability is located in the `Load XML Configuration` module for file imports. The xml file impact input
data of the configuration for the software. In several values of the xml file the inputs are not recognized by an approval of the secure
software validation mechanism. The iis configuration settings are connected to a secure validation process, the sql install database
information in the xml file are not. The non-exisiting input validation and the unrestricted context size allows local attackers to
trigger a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. That results in compromise of the software process with system privileges.
The security risk of the local buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.0.
Exploitation of the stack buffer overflow vulnerability requires a low privilege or restricted system user account without user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in overwrite of the active registers to compromise of the computer system or process.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Load XML Configuration
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privileged or restricted system user account without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the software vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue the process.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Download the newst software version of the Kentico cms (v9.0.x - 9.0.5981.23486)
2. Accept the program conditions and click to custom installation
3. Open the local hosted xml poc file
4. Include a large unicode payload to the marked values
5. Save the xml file on your localhost
6. Move back to the kentico v9.x installation process with the custom install screen
Note: Attach a debugger to followup with the overwrite on the active registers
7. Load the xml poc file by usage of the import function of kentico (left|buttom)
8. The vulnerable values loaded and the process will permanently crash with different exceptions
9. Move back to the debugger that is attached to the active software process and followup with an overwrite of the active ecx, ebp or eip registers
10. Successful reproduce of the local buffer overflow vulnerability!
PoC: Vulnerable Source (XML)

Note: Start the software exe file kentico v9.0 on windows, attach the windows debugger and load the xml config file to overwrite the ecx and eip registers.
The installation path and the iis website values are not exploitable, because of the active content restrictions of the process that drops an invalid
argument exception to prevent.
