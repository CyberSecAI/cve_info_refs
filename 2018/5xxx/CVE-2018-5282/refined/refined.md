Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `Load XML Configuration` module of Kentico CMS during file imports.
- The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation and size restrictions when parsing data from an XML configuration file, specifically within the SQL install database information.
- Several values within the XML file are not validated, which allows attackers to provide overly large inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow
- Missing input validation
- Lack of size restrictions on imported data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local attackers can overwrite active registers, leading to potential system compromise.
- Attackers can compromise the software process with system privileges.
- The process will crash when the large payload is loaded, causing a denial of service
- Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable application, leading to complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `Load XML Configuration` module, specifically during XML file imports.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML configuration file with oversized payloads in the `SqlName`, `SqlPswd`, `Database`, `Server`, `UserName`, and `Password` fields under the `<Sql>` and `<Notification>` XML tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- A low-privilege or restricted system user account is sufficient for exploitation.
- No user interaction is required after the attacker has access.
- The attacker needs to be able to import an XML file.
