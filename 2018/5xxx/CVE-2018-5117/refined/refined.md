Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles right-to-left (RTL) text within the address bar when the text is aligned left-to-right (LTR). This can lead to a visual URL spoofing issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **URL Spoofing:** The core issue is that the address bar can be manipulated to display a misleading URL. By using a combination of RTL text with a LTR alignment, an attacker can cause part of the URL to be scrolled out of view, while making a different, attacker-controlled, domain appear to be the actual location.
- This can confuse users to believe they are on a different site than the one they actually loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Users can be tricked into believing they are visiting a legitimate site, making them vulnerable to credential theft, or other malicious activities. The visible URL could lead the user to believe they are on a trusted site, when they are in fact on a malicious one.
- **Misinformation:** Users can be misled to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack requires a specially crafted URL with a combination of right-to-left and left-to-right text. This URL needs to be displayed in the address bar with a left-to-right alignment.
- The attack could be triggered by either pasting the crafted URL or by dragging the URL text from a web page to the addressbar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to craft a URL with right-to-left text and left-to-right alignment.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to either paste this URL into the addressbar or drag text to the addressbar.
- No special capabilities, permissions or local access to the machine is needed.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

- The vulnerability is present in Firefox, Thunderbird, and Firefox ESR.
- The vulnerability is related to the Skia library (integer overflow).
- Other vulnerabilities fixed in the same patch include memory safety bugs, use-after-free vulnerabilities in several areas including form elements, HTML media elements, font face manipulation, WebRTC, Web Workers, etc.
- Red Hat identified this vulnerability under RHSA-2018:0122 for Firefox and RHSA-2018:0262 for Thunderbird.
- The fix involves preventing the address bar text from being scrolled in a misleading way by properly handling right-to-left characters.

In summary, CVE-2018-5117 highlights a URL spoofing vulnerability in Firefox, Thunderbird and Firefox ESR caused by improper rendering of RTL text with LTR alignment in the address bar, making it possible for a malicious actor to misrepresent the actual URL. The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 58, Firefox ESR 52.6 and Thunderbird 52.6.
