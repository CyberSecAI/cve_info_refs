| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, and Jason Orendorff reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 57, Firefox ESR 52.5, and Thunderbird 52.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0122)

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 52.6.0 ESR.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2018-5089, CVE-2018-5091, CVE-2018-5095, CVE-2018-5096, CVE-2018-5097, CVE-2018-5098, CVE-2018-5099, CVE-2018-5102, CVE-2018-5103, CVE-2018-5104, CVE-2018-5117)
* To mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks similar to "Spectre" and "Meltdown", the resolution of performance.now() has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, Jason Orendorff, Looben Yang, Anonymous, Nils, and Xisigr as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

##### References

* [Bug 1421099](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421099)

#### [#CVE-2018-5109: Audio capture prompts and starts with incorrect origin attribution](#CVE-2018-5109)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson

#### [#CVE-2018-5111: URL spoofing in addressbar through drag and drop](#CVE-2018-5111)

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

DOM: CSS Object Model
▾

Core :: DOM: CSS Object Model

Issues with CSSOM support and other CSS-related DOM APIs. This is not the place for most CSS bugs unless they involve scripting; see the CSS and Layout components instead.

Example bugs:

* document.styleSheets doesn’t include style sheets from file:// URLs
* crash setting element.style.color to "red"

Specifications covered:

* CSS Font Loading
* CSSOM
* CSSOM View Module
* Geometry Interfaces

The following testcase crashes the latest ASAN build of Firefox nightly (SourceStamp=defccba824aa91e8d4d820b1defaadfdca34bac7). It requires the fuzzPriv extension.
<script>
function spin () {
var x=new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST","<https://mozilla.org>",false);
try{x.send("X");}catch(e){}
}
function start() {
o179=document.cloneNode(true);
o585=o179.fonts;
o919=new FontFace('font7',"url('X')");
o585.add(o919);
o585.clear();
spin();
o585=null;o179=null;
fuzzPriv.GC();fuzzPriv.CC();
o919.load();
}
</script>

:heycam, this involves FontFaceSet manipulation, which I think you know more about.... looks like the FontFace here has been GC'd even though the script still had a reference to it, implying that we mismanaged ownership/referencing at some point. Can you take a look?Flags: needinfo?(jfkthame) → needinfo?(cam)

Slightly varying stacks, but I'm seeing UAF crashes in DoLoadNextSrc in the wild in Release and Beta.

Those may not be the same crash as this so double-check object lifetime around this code, not just the specific path the testcase points at.Crash Signature: [@ RefPtr<T>::operator= | gfxUserFontEntry::DoLoadNextSrc ]

1. We start with the test document, its FontFaceSet, and the gfxUserFontSet (really, FontFaceSet::UserFontSet, which extends gfxUserFontSet). Call these document\_a, font\_face\_set\_a, etc.
2. We create the cloned document (this doesn't need to be cloned, just some separate document), which gets its own FontFaceSet and gfxUserFontSet. Call these document\_b, font\_face\_set\_b, etc.
3. The new FontFace() call creates a new FontFace with its mFontFaceSet (its "primary" FontFaceSet) being font\_face\_set\_a, and with its mUserFontEntry null.
4. We call font\_face\_set\_b.add(font\_face), which adds font\_face\_set\_b to font\_face's mOtherFontFaceSets.
5. We call font\_face\_set\_b.clear(), which, because it calls FlushUserFontSet, causes the FontFace to get a gfxUserFontEntry. That gfxUserFontEntry has a raw pointer to the user\_font\_set\_b. It then removes font\_face\_set\_b from font\_face's mOtherFontFaceSets.
6. We drop our local references to document\_b and font\_face\_set\_b, then do a GC/CC. This ends up unlinking both of these objects, and as part of unlinking FontFaceSet, it drops its strong reference to its gfxUserFontSet, and it is destroyed, while the gfxUserFontEntry still has its raw pointer to it.
7. We call font\_face.load() which wants to do something with the dangling gfxUserFontSet pointer.
So I think it's probably not correct to create the gfxUserFontEntry associated with the user font set of the thing that wants to load the font, and instead we should use the FontFace's primary FontFaceSet's gfxUserFontSet, since that is the one that will know will stay alive. (Because the FontFace holds a strong reference to that FontFaceSet.)
But we should probably check exactly what the gfxUserFontEntry uses its mUserFontSet for. We should only end up being able to share gfxUserFontEntrys between different documents/FontFaceSets that are same origin, so probably it's OK. But it might cause error messages to be reported to different windows.

So gfxUserFontEntry::mFontSet (not mUserFontSet as I mistyped above) is used for:
\* the CSP check
\* the referrer policy used
\* reporting errors to the console
\* the document node passed to NS\_NewChannelWithTriggeringPrincipal
\* the document load group used
\* doing the load origin check
\* determining whether the cache should be bypassed
\* checking whether we're in private browsing mode
For some of these things, whichever gfxUserFontSet is used we'll get the same result, e.g. because private browsing mode and cache bypass should have the same values. And since we can only stick a FontFace from one window into another window when script can access that other window, any difference in principal shouldn't matter. The CSP directives and referrer policy to use are bigger issues, but I think you could make the case that consistently using the FontFace's creating window is better than choosing one or the other depending on exactly how the FontFace load is triggered (via a load() on the FontFace itself, or due to layout / document.fonts.load() on one of the windows). Some quick testing shows Chrome does this, and I filed <https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2113> to clarify the spec.

Does this indicate that `fe` is e5e5e5e5e5e5e5e5 and we're crashing while trying to read its mRefCnt? If so, I'm not sure yet how that happens.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I'll attach backports.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I think the chance is low. This does cause a user visible change to some edge cases, where a FontFace is created in one document, inserted in another, and there are different CSP or referrer policies between the two documents. But this change does make us match Chrome now.
The existing test\_font\_loading\_api.html is pretty extensive, so would catch any important user facing regressions.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053622
Steps to reproduce:
The ActiveTab permission allows an extension to only access the current tab (after the user interacted with the extension). This is to allow "extensions to fulfill a common use case, without having to give them very powerful permissions" like <all\_urls> (quote from the documentation).
However, it was found that this permission also allows access to frames within the tab that can be of a different domain. This allows a malicious extension, that requested only a very strict permission set, to still interact with any domain:
1. The extension injects code into the tab that creates a hidden iframe to an arbitrary domain.
2. The extension then injects code into that frame creating an XSS situation. This obviously allows for many kinds of nefarious actions such as theft of information, request forgery etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To recreate:
1. Inject code that creates a hidden iframe
2. Wait for the frame to load
3. inject any script into that frame
I provide a POC extension that shows a browser action (button). When clicked, a hidden iframe to "<https://example.com>" is created in the current tab and the cookies for that URL are console.log()ed.
The extension only requests activeTab yet this works regardless of the URL of the active tab.
Actual results:
The malicious code runs in all the frames in the current tab, including the iframe that was just created.
Expected results:
The activeTab should allow access to the parent frame only, and not to any inner frames. This is the behaviour in the Chrome browser.

So what you are saying is that you expect 'activeTab' to only grant a permission to the origin of the top level frame? What happens if the page actually contains cross-domain iframes? The add-on can not interact with them? That's not very intuitive to me, but its interesting if that is the way chrome has implemented it. Our model might have been a deliberate design decision, I dont know.
(NB We haven't documented this behavior either way; I know this as I am currently writing the security model documentation at the moment for Firefox's implementation of browser extensions).
Kris, Andrew - what do you think about this? Firstly is this something we would like to change? On one hand I think it makes the security model more consistent (i.e. you explicitly need the host permission to in order to executeScript in a frame) but the flipside is that might break extensions which rely on the currently behavior (and it might also result in all extensions requesting the <all\_urls> permission. I tend to agree with the reporter here though - while activeTab isn't quite as permissive as <all\_urls>
If we are going to change this, then I assume we would also need to change the behavior of the tabs and activeTab APIs, to grant a permission to the current frame. (and then I wonder, would that be scoped to the actual page or the origin, ie can you inject script into same origin iframes with different URLs. Origin would probably make the most sense).
If we DON'T want to make this change, then we should at least ensure that AMO and reviewers treat tab & activeTab with the same level of caution. (in line with <all\_urls> )
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:
This seems like an important incompatibility with chrome if the behavior is as described - if we didn't do this deliberately, its probably something we want to address.

This behavior is intentional, yes. If Chrome behaves differently, that's certainly not the way it was documented when we implemented this. If we were to implement different restrictions, we'd probably still want to allow access to sub-frames that are same-origin with the root.
That said, I'm not sure that restricting access to subframes is what we want. Unless perhaps we only include subframes that were already present when the activeTab permission was granted.
But, really, any domain that's worth trying to hijack this way should set appropriate X-Frame-Options headers to prevent it being loaded in a subframe to begin with.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Honestly the documentation is all over the shop on this topic(both ours and theirs). But I think there is no point implementing restrictions if we allow subframes (there is no way to tell between legit sub-frames and injected sub-frames, right?). I'd agree with you x-frame-options, except that most sites don't set this even though they should.
From digging a little more into the chrome documentation, I don't think we are meeting the intention of the activeTab permission[1]. IIUC The design goals were to provide a permission which was NOT as dangerous as <all\_urls>, and hence they only allow scripting to the current page, until the page has been navigated. If don't restrict the sub-frame scripting then activeTab is as dangerous as <all\_urls> and in fact worse, since the implication isn't clear.
[1] <https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/activeTab#motivation>
And what our own documentation says is quoted above already ( "The intention of this permission is to enable extensions to fulfill a common use case, without having to give them very powerful permissions.")
Currently activeTab effectively as dangerous as <all\_urls>, just with the added restriction of requiring user interaction prior to execution. Of course, the other part of the story is that chrome doesn't show the activeTab permission to the user. Which seems deceptive to me. (I guess their assumption is that if the user is interacting with addon via a browser/page action, then this signals intent for the permission grant - and as such it would make sense to block sub-frames since the user cant be aware of the other origins that might be framed.)
So I actually think that we should 'fix' this, and block script execution in subframes, unless the extension has the correct permission.

I agree that it's confusing. Being called activeTab (and not activeTopFrameOfTab) it implies the entire tab. My own extension (Check4Change) would have wanted a "real" activeTab but would regrettably need to request <all\_urls> in order to access subframes in the current tab.
However, leaving this unfixed is too dangerous (IMO) as, like was said above, it is "effectively as dangerous as <all\_urls>" but without letting the user know.
One can overcome the X-Frame-Options restriction by loading URLs like these:
<https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png>
<https://www.facebook.com/ajax/bz>
The header doesn't mitigate the attack as it is intended to stop clickjacking and therefor only needed in the top-level pages (where there are actions to be done). It is not present (nor needs to be) in inner elements (in the examples about: The google logo, or a facebook ajax point). But of course an iframe can load an image and once it does it is within the Same-Origin of its domain, allowing execution of client side scripts.

[PoC modified to work in both chrome and firefox](attachment.cgi?id=8905692)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8905692&action=edit)

This should work in both Chrome and Firefox.
STR:
1. Install addon as temporary addon
2. navigate to webpage that isnt exmaple.com (e.g. <https://misuse.co>)
3. press the browser action button installed by the extension
Results:
In chrome, one alert fires (for the top level domain)
In Firefox, two alerts fire (for both domains)

My 2c. I wonder why a malicious addon wouldn't just request the permissions it needs to access subframes anyway. Maybe a few less people will install, but they wouldn't have to deal with limitations.

Its a fair point and why it's a P2 and not a blocker in my opinion.
Legacy add-ons could of course just do all this with no prompting at all, but hey we should probably get the permissions matching expectations.

My 2c reply. One of the majors reasons moving away from legacy add-ons in the first place was security. The idea that add-ons couldn't just do anything they wanted anymore but rather had to ask for granular permissions and thus giving control back to the users to make an informed decision.
It's definitely arguable if this security mechanism (permissions) is broken by design because most users just click "ok" anyway (similar to Android). However it is still \*a\* security mechanism of the browser. It would be much simpler to do away with it entirely and just grant all permissions to all add-ons, but I assume no one would advocate for that as the simplicity doesn't outweigh the security benefits.
----------
I've noticed the bug was labeled "sec-moderate". It is my feeling that according to the guidelines (<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings>) the bug doesn't adhere to the description of "sec-moderate", yet fits well as "sec-high". From the doc "sec-high" allows "Obtaining confidential data from other sites the user is visiting, or inject data or code into those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions." (assuming installing an add-on is normal browsing actions).
Disclaimer: While I genuinely feel all the above is true, I wouldn't be arguing over semantics if I wasn't excited about the possibility of my bug achieving bug-bounty fame. :)

I probably agree with you there - would the less scary warning be worth it for a malicious add-on writer? I don't know, but it's clear we need to fix this as currently the activeTab permission doesn't fulfill the purpose of its existence.
The whole reason for the existence of "activeTab" permission is that its supposed to be a less dangerous permission, and that's the justification for why we \_show nothing\_ in the install permission prompt when a add-on has this permission. The idea with ActiveTab is that since the user has interacted with the tab (browser/page action, context menu etc) [1] then there is an implicit permission grant to interact with that page, if the extension has asked that it needs such permission.
So I thinks an important bug to fix, as currently our permission warnings (or lack of) are somewhat misleading imho.
(In reply to Ronen Zilberman from [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames"))
> My 2c reply....
Totally agree with you here that it needs to be fixed. Security is definitely a motivation for web extensions, but its more about removing the all-powerful nature of legacy extensions than actively trying to giving the user more control.
I do think however that sec-moderate is appropriate though both because the limited value this represents for attacker and inherent limitations of permission granting as a security control (i.e. users don't read prompts). Also activeTab requires user interaction in the form clicking a browser action, page action or context menu button.
Regardless of the rating, I do think this is worth bounty consideration, and I have flagged it as such. I've been explicitly testing our web extension implementation and I hadn't noticed this bug, so I'm a definitely very grateful here for the bug report here.

I did a little more testing on this in Chrome and empirically, it seems that Chrome distinguishes script-injected content and does not grant access to that content via activeTab. When this bug was originally filed, it wasn't feasible to implement that behavior in Firefox. But Kris, with your recent work on [bug 1406278](/show_bug.cgi?id=1406278 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use the subject principal as the triggering principal for loads of script-generated content") would it be feasible to do that now?Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Yeah, to some extent. Script-injected frames should have a triggeringPrincipal set for their src attribute (but not for their srcdoc attribute). But there are other ways to navigate a frame than setting its src property.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

So the rule can be: an extension can only use the activeTab permission to inject a script into a frame if the frame's current location matches its src attribute and its triggeringPrincipal is not an extension principal (or should this check be even more specific?)

The extension can set the src using the page's principal, and we don't currently record any principal for parser-created nodes. We need to actually record when the src was set using a non-script-created parser.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

When you say "script-injected" content - does that mean "any frames that were injected by a script (as opposed to declared in html)"? IE that if a webpage dynamically adds frames to itself with a script, Web Extensions will not have permission to inject into these with only the activetab permission?
Just making sure I understand this clearly (I should test this I suppose)

That sounds great to me. Again just to make sure I understand your goal here, the effective permission of activeTab permission would then to allow script injection into:
a) the top-level window of the current tab
b) Any iframes which are declared in the HTML of the document
I was expecting just (a), but if you would prefer (a)& (b) for compat reasons, that seems to make sense too. My goal here is to ensure that activeTab is significantly less privileged than <all\_urls>.Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

Yes, that is the proposal. We can't reliably distinguish script-injected frames that are created by the page itself from those created by an extension so its really the only safe thing to do.

Right a&b is what Chrome does and is what is proposed here.

I don't think this will work. It will just tell us the resolved URL of the current src attribute, but that could have changed since the frame was created.
I think we probably need to change the frame element code to clear the mNetworkCreated flag when the src/srcset attributes are changed, rather than when it's inserted into the document.

Actually, ignore this. Your way is better. If an extension has permissions for a
frame, it should always be able to inject into it. If it doesn't, we should fall
back to active tab permissions.

Still needs a test which is going to be tricky since all the apis that grant
the activeTab permission are browser- or mobile-specific. But for now here's
the patch to look at.

I think this should be something like `if (!succeeded || !equal) mHasNavigated = true`
Otherwise, it should be possible to reset the flag.

aInit is const, do you suggest making a copy? That seems like small overhead but totally unnecessary in most (hopefully all) cases.

Hm. Fair enough. Maybe just throw and return rather than asserting, then.

The more I think about this, the more I think we should also keep this check in `MatchesURI`, even if it is redundant. We don't currently call this function anywhere else, but we do expose it to JS, and it might lead to a future footgun.

Maybe just .sort() and use `Assert.deepEqual()` rather than checking the length and then doing two .include() checks? Would make it a bit clearer exactly what's going on...

Clarify rules for applying activeTab permission to content scripts
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Relatively easily by somebody who understands the code
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The tests are in a separate patch that can be landed separately. I've tried to avoid any comments in the code or the checkin summary that point toward the problem.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
I believe all supported branches (release, beta, esr) are affected.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This should backport easily to 57. A backport to ESR would be rather difficult.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The patch touches docshell which is heavily used, but it is small and follows our established practices so the risk should be low.

Sec-approval+ for checkin on November 28, two weeks into the new cycle. Please do not check in before that date.
We'll want this on other branches so branch patches should be made and nominated at that time as well. If you don't think we can easily do ESR52 (as mentioned in [comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c37 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames")) then we can go without it since it isn't that long until the next ESR branch.

bz: this patch needs review from a DOM peer, I'm sure you're busy, should I redirect to somebody else?
This is still a week and a half from landing but I'm going to be on PTO most of next week and was hoping to get the review done before leaving. If you're pinched for time, focusing on the docshell bits and ignoring the webextensions bits (which kmag reviwed) should be fine.

This needs a much better commit message, unless that would expose the security issue. It should describe what the new rules are and why the particular rules we're changing to are the ones we want. This is part of what made this review so slow. I've had to reverse-engineer the intent from the patch. I probably should have just brought this up immediately instead. :(
>+ , mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage(false)
I don't understand the desired semantics of mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage.
If I do window.open(url), should that really have different semantics from:
var w = window.open();
setTimeout(function() { w.location.href = url }, 100);
? It looks to me like the former would have mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage false while the latter has it true.
Same thing for <iframe> created without src and then getting it src attribute set.
>+ NS\_ENSURE\_ARG\_POINTER(aResult);
Please don't. Callers just shouldn't do that.

I'm not sure I follow. At the very least, this needs a comment explaining why.

That (exposing the issue) is what I was concerned about. I'm happy to expand on the commit message, but could use some feedback on how much is okay (ie from security).
Regardless, sorry for the confusion :/

Yes, that is desired for this particular scenario. This case may be rather narrow but consider a page that has a blank iframe and an extension that has the activeTab permission (but no specific host permissions). The extension can navigate the frame to some new URL, then inject a content script with allFrames: true and now they've managed to inject a script at a site that they should not have access to. If we could distinguish when the extension is the one navigating the frame perhaps we could use that, but I don't think we actually can make that distinction in a foolproof way.
(If the above has too much WebExtensions jargon please ask for clarification, I'd be glad to clear it up here or on IRC or whatever)

> I'm happy to expand on the commit message, but could use some feedback on how much is okay (ie from security).
Can we start with a writeup in this bug of what the commit message would be if we ignore security considerations?
So if I understand correctly, if an extension has activeTab permissions we \_do\_ want to allow it to interact with cross-origin iframes the page itself loads, but not ones the extension loads?
Can the extension not inject the blank iframe itself? Can it not inject an iframe with src already set?

Correct, but only frames created by the network parser. It's too easy for the extensions to create frames from the context of content JS.

It can, but we're only allowing access to frames that were network-created.

Ah, I see. So the key part is that we're restricting this to <iframe> elements that have an src when they come out of the HTML parser, \_and\_ excluding cases when that parser is document.write() or innerHTML or whatever.
What happens if the extension injects something like:
<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src=whatever></iframe>"></iframe>
Does that inner iframe get treated as "created by the network parser"? If so, how is it handled by this setup?

That's a good question. I suspect that it does, but I'm not sure. We should test it.
I think we can solve that problem by checking the activeTab permission for parent frames when we do the matching.

I assume we can't easily leverage the "use the extension as the triggering principal for loads it starts" work, because that doesn't actually happen in all the cases we care about?

At this point, it's more that the extension can always do things using the page principal if it wants, using wrappedJSObject, eval, or injecting script nodes. I don't think there's really any reasonable way we can prevent that. I wish we could, though...

I tried this out and in my test, we never get around to checking hasNavigated.. since Matches() returns false here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/9bab9dc5a9472e3c163ab279847d2249322c206e/toolkit/components/extensions/WebExtensionPolicy.cpp#338-340>
This is over my head, I defer to kmag and bz to evaluate whether this is sufficient.

That will return false for the srcdoc iframe, but not for the iframe loaded from the parsed srcdoc attribute. Which may not actually exist in bz's actual example, depending on how the HTML parser deals with the invalid syntax from a > being present in an attribute value, but, e.g.:
<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src='[http://example.com/'&gt](http://example.com/%27%26gt);</iframe&gt>"></iframe>
for instance, should still wind up loading a content script into the example.com iframe.

Yes, I fixed that in my test. What I actually ended up with in the top-level doc is (as copied from devtools Inspector):
<iframe style="display: block;" srcdoc="<iframe src=&quot;[http://example.com/&quot](http://example.com/%26quot);></iframe>"></iframe>
The inner iframe didn't actually load anything from example.com though...

`>` ends an element declaration, even when it appears in an attribute value. At least in theory. But it looks like our tag soup parser currently accepts it, and:
document.body.innerHTML=`<iframe srcdoc="<iframe src='<http://example.com/>'></iframe>"></iframe>`
does appear to actually create an iframe with an example.com iframe loaded into it.

Bleah, never mind [comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames"), the inner frame was blocked by the CSP of the outer frame in my test.
With that removed, the script is indeed injected into the inner frame.

So I'm still a bit confused by the semantics of mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage. If the page has:
<iframe></iframe>
(no src attribute) and then the extension navigates the iframe to a url of its choosing, what will mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage be set to? Will the extension get access to the resulting page?Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

It shouldn't, but we should make sure that's tested.

Yep, that case isn't handled correctly.
Perhaps mHasNavigatedFromInitialPage is poorly named but the desired semantics are something like "false if this page/frame is what was originally loaded from the network, true if it is possible that a script has caused this page/frame to load something from a different source".
My first pass at this involved monkeying around with nsGenericHTMLFrameElement and that got kind of messy but it seems like this particular case isn't going to be detectable from the docshell and we'll have to go back to the frame element and track whether any of the frame's attributes have been changed? Any suggestions for simpler alternatives would be gratefully welcomed...

I agree that it's not clear how to detect this stuff from the docshell right now.
So one option is that the first time nsGenericHTMLFrameElement::LoadSrc reaches the mFrameLoader->LoadFrame() line for a given element that came from network, we indicate that to nsFrameLoader::LoadFrame somehow. This will, in practice, mean the load when we get inserted into the document.
I agree that threading this information through LoadFrame, LoadURI, frameloader initialization, etc, is a pain. I'm not seeing an obvious better option, though...

No tests. No bug that needs sec-approval should ever land with tests. If it is nightly and beta only, we can check in tests right after it lands on both. Otherwise, tests need to wait until about a month after public release.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

In theory a&b matches a user's expectation and Chrome compat is important, so I'm OK with it in theory. But implementing (b) raises all kinds of edge cases (some of which bz notes in comments above) that I worry in practice we won't be plugging the hole.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

"normal browsing" means with an unmodified browser; an attack like that can affect all our users. Installing an extension of any kind is already granting extra power that would be considered a security hole if a web page suddenly started doing it.

I haven't followed this thread for a while, so I wanted to chip in.
If I understand your proposed solution correctly, the idea is that with ActiveTab an extension can interact with iframes that were loaded by the original page, but not with iframes that were loaded by the extension itself.
I'd like to point out that many pages might have "high-value" iframes originally: Facebook Like buttons for example, are implemented as an iframe pointing to facebook.com. This means that if a page has a Like button, an extension with "ActiveTab" can steal that user's cookies and therefor identity. Google ads might be the same case.

Clarify rules for applying activeTab permission to content scripts
I \_think\_ there's a hole here, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
Say the page has <iframe src="foo">. We go through nsGenericHTMLFrameElement, set mLoadCount to 1.
Then a navigation is performed by setting frame.contentWindow.location.href. The docshell is not created dynamically, nsContentUtils::IsNavigatedFrame returns false, right? So we're going to end up returning true from ShouldMatchActiveTabPermission(), but the desired behavior is to return false, I would think. We should make sure to add a corresponding test. And tests for all the other edge cases we've considered in this bug so far...
That is, we need to keep track of whether the thing we're looking at was in fact loaded from the src attribute of the element, not just of how many loads were done from that src attribute.

[wip](attachment.cgi?id=8934269&action=diff) (obsolete)

Here's a snapshot of the work in progress, I've rolled the tests into the
patch just to (hopefully) make it easier to look at for now. I've done
the rough work from [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames") but once we get into docshell I quickly
got lost. In the current patch I just remember the value of the incoming
flag in nsDocShell::LoadURI() but that's clearly too early, if the load
fails or if it ends up occurring in a different shell, we won't do the
right thing. But I am unsure how to handle this and could use some advice...

wip
I'm really sorry about the lag. I was trying to figure out what we're really trying to accomplish here.
So my gut feeling is that trying to store this in members on docshell/frameloader/etc is going to be very fragile.
It seems to me that conceptually we should do something like this:
1) A frame element <iframe> or <frame> keeps track of whether the load it's doing is for the initial value of the attribute for a parser-created element. More on this below.
2) We propagate this information far enough down the callstack to stash it in the LoadInfo of the channel.
3) When we need to find this information for a given inner window or document, we ask the document channel.
This would handle cases like the page having <iframe></iframe> with no src and the extension setting src later, for example....
Note that this sort of needs to operate on inner windows, not outer ones. I'm not sure why the existing checks are done on outer windows or docshells....
Does that make any sense?

Not to worry, thanks for being patient with the elementary questions and multiple iterations, I'm slowly absorbing everything here...

To be clear, is the way this information is gathered in the existing patch in nsFrameLoader adequate?

And do I understand correctly that this is again mostly what the existing patch does but enabling the new INTERNAL\_LOAD flag, then copying this into loadInfo inside nsDocShell::DoURILoad() ?

The code path in question here begins with an extension doing something like `browser.tabs.executeScript({tabid, {...}})` where tabid just identifies a tab (which corresponds to an outer window right?). At some point we need to map this to the specific document currently loaded in that tab. I'm having a hard time grokking all the different components here, is there a difference between accessing `outerWin.GetDoc()` and `outerWin.GetCurrentInnerWindow().GetDoc()`? (I know the syntax there is wrong but you get the idea)
> Does that make any sense?
I think so, assuming the answer to the questions above isn't "no you're wildly off the mark"

> To be clear, is the way this information is gathered in the existing patch in nsFrameLoader adequate?
Hmm. I guess we have to use a member there because the load goes async before it needs the "is this the original src?" info, right.
I read over that part just now, and it looks fine. I wish it were simpler, but I don't see how to do that offhand without major surgery of some sort.

That seems plausible, yes. I'd like to avoid the mFrameAtOriginalSrc member on docshell.
> where tabid just identifies a tab (which corresponds to an outer window right?)
Yes.

That makes sense.
> is there a difference between accessing `outerWin.GetDoc()` and `outerWin.GetCurrentInnerWindow().GetDoc()`?
There is not. I guess my point was that we want to store this "I am the result of this sort of load" information on the document (and then get it from the window's current document), not the docshell.

I think this reflects everything we discussed previously. It touches
what seems to me like an unreasonably large number of files/lines, but
if there's a simpler way to do this I'm not seeing it :/

r=me with the nits fixed. Thank you for doing this.
And I agree that the way we had to propagate this boolean is moderately nuts. We should really simplify the loading codepaths and deCOM docshell loadinfo...

Why is it not injected into emptyframe?
There are some edge cases that are not really tested here:
1) <iframe> coming from innerHTML (should not get injected into).
2) <iframe> coming from an XHR responseXML (so from a network parser) and then getting adopted into the web page document.
3) innerHTML injecting an <iframe srcdoc> containing another iframe, as in [comment 45](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399#c45 "RESOLVED FIXED - An extension can XSS any domain with only the ActiveTab permission using frames").
4) window.open of a new window, which should get injected into, presumably.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the comment, are you concerned that the new tab can get created and loaded before we call awaitLoad()? There are many asynchronous things that happen between entering browser.tabs.create() and the corresponding onCompleted event firing, they would all have to go away for that to become an issue, which I think it is safe to say will not happen.

I've tried with the latest revision. Its not completely straightforward since a bunch of these functions get serialized into strings in extensions (but we write the code this way so we can lint the functions instead of putting the code into big string constants).

Oops, it means I meant to fill this in but I overlooked it before pushing. Sorry about that, I'll fix it.

Because in this case we're not passing the (somewhat misleadingly named) `matchAboutBlank` option to executeScript(). But I've done a bunch of refactoring of the tests and am now always passing that flag (and then checking empty frames as appropriate)

Whoops I realized I didn't cover this in the latest test patch.
However, we don't currently propagate activeTab to children created in this way, and my gut reaction is that we shouldn't do so. Maybe we could take this question to a follow-up bug?

> are you concerned that the new tab can get created and loaded before we call awaitLoad()
I'm concerned that it can get created and loaded before awaitLoad sets up enough of its state to be awaiting the load. Or is the idea that once awaitLoad has returned we are all set for the listeners it needs to add? If so this might be ok, though I would be happier if the awaitLoad() call happened \_before\_ the create() call.

Actually, we should probably just test that we do \_not\_ inject in that case, because an extension can do the window.open. Followup bug is OK for the test, though.

I would just do it on try at this point since it is checked into the integration branch.

Oops, my question about try was originally meant for trunk but now the main patch has landed. The patches apply cleanly to beta and all the new tests pass. I haven't done a beta try run but I think if the patch sticks on autoland we should be good:
<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=autoland&revision=ff6e9d3a6441aa4510ed47d5383e79fe5a412576>
I'm going to request beta approval now since I'll be away from the computer for a while this evening but if the approval is granted quickly can we wait to see that the above run is green before landing there (:RyanVM I assume you are the one who would be doing the landing)

Is there a reason we don't listen to this frame's load with frameLoaded? Seems like we should (and nframes should be 4, not 3).
r=me with that fixed or explained. Thank you!

Set intestsuite? to flag them for later. It is going to be at least four weeks after a release containing the fixes, assuming normal uptake and that we don't, for example, turn off updates for a week to chemspill. In other words, I can't give a specific date at this time. Probably the end of February.Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |

This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

Works on Linux too.
Dan: did you mean "RTL language" in the new title?
So the trick here is that the Arabic domain is RTL, so it appears on the right of the address bar, but then it gets pushed off by all the spaces and Hebrew text, because we are still left-justifying the contents? IOW, the fix is to make sure that the justification rules on the address bar are such that the actual domain is always visible?

Since this issue has a sec-moderate rating right now I don't want to track it for 56. We're getting close to the 56 release. Happy to take a patch for 56 if we land one.

Forwarding to Panos to evaluate the available resources.
It would be nice to fix it for sure, I don't know if it's as urgent to be in 56, the spoofed font is somehow recognizable and the identity panel points to the right domain. I can see it as a concern for a less expert user.
Surely the best thing would be to always scroll the locationbar to show the domain.Flags: needinfo?(mak77) → needinfo?(past)

We already do that (force selectionStart + End to 0). It's not clear to me off-hand what part of it isn't working somehow.

The url is LTR aligned (https is on the left), but the RTL chars are RTL aligned. And looks like there can be mixed direction domains. The input field is LTR in an LTR build.
There's some background in [bug 993806](/show_bug.cgi?id=993806 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - URL Bar text alignment in RTL mode") and [bug 641238](/show_bug.cgi?id=641238 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - The location bar alignment should be LTR, even though the Firefox build is RTL (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic..) — Regression from Firefox 3.6") for the braves.
Fwiw, Chrome puts the scheme in a static element, and scrolls all the rest of the string to the right. It may not be necessary to keep showing the scheme considered the identity panel? (they also don't decode the %20)

The trouble is, the domain is nowhere near the start (offset 0) of the urlbar content. Setting selectionStart/End to 0 ensures that the left-hand edge of the "https://..." scheme is visible; but then the domain is at the far right of the urlbar content, out of sight.
If I arbitrarily hack browser.js so that it sets selectionStart/End to 8 instead of 0 (i.e. placing the selection immediately after "https://"), then the testcase here behaves better, with the (Arabic-script) domain visible -- although not perfectly, because of the fade-out effect is still applied at the right-hand end, so the beginning of the domain name fades away. And of course now the scheme is no longer visible. So even if we did this (more correctly, by checking the actual offset of the domain rather than hard-coding "8"), it wouldn't be very satisfactory.
If we could avoid decoding the %20 characters, that would help quite a lot, although it could make some legitimate URLs look more ugly. (Note that the %20s in question are part of the fragment identifier here, not part of an actual domain label.) Offhand I'm not sure where to hack that, though.

That's why I'm wondering if, with the identity icon always visible, we still care about the scheme.
If we care, Chrome solution (sticky scheme) sounds feasible.

There's also the issue that the fade-out truncation we apply at the (right-hand) end of the urlbar results in fading the beginning of the domain name.

We could drop the fade out at the end and instead truncate in the middle with an ellipsis (…) so that the beginning and end of the URL are always visible. Is that what you mean by a sticky scheme, Marco?
I agree with Jonathan that not decoding the spaces would help a lot. I'd go further and say that by itself is an acceptable fix for this case. But I think I like the truncation idea, too.

yes, even if I'd not define that "in the middle", it looks like they put ellipsis just after the scheme (so the scheme is "sticky" positioned and the rest of the url is just scrolled to the far right).
Putting ellipsis in the middle, with that many spaces could still be confusing, especially on 16:9 and ultrawide (21:9) screens, the real domain would still be at the far right, while the fake one would still appear just after the scheme.

My interpretation of Chrome's behavior is that the ellipsis is at the (logical) end of the text, which means it appears at the left-hand end of the (right-to-left) text.
Something like this could possibly be achieved by wrapping the URL (not including the scheme) in an inline-block element with dir=auto and styling it with text-overflow:ellipsis, overflow:hidden, and width:.... umm, not sure what. I don't think -moz-available works here, so it might have to be computed somehow.
(Applying text-overflow:ellipsis to the URL as a whole (including scheme) cannot give this result, AFAICT from the spec for text-overflow.)
I suspect forcing the spaces to be displayed as %20 is much easier to implement as a short-term fix, however. Reworking the elements within the urlbar to separate the scheme from the rest of the URL (and allow us to align/truncate them separately) sounds....risky and disruptive.

So, I think that in any case we should show the %20, the spaces are just too confusing.
The 2 proposed solutions:
1. ellipsis in the middle:
- simpler and potentially upliftable
- on overflow it may still look confusing
scheme://fake.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20...%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
2. separate the scheme from the url, ellipsis at the end of the url
- more complex to do
- on overflow it's less confusing
scheme://...e.domain%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20real.domain
if there's no overflow, the 2 solutions look the same, and the confusion may be solved by the domain hilight. Regardless the hilight helps if we always show the domain, so probably solution 1 has better cost/benefit balance.

Just ensuring the spaces are displayed as %20 goes a long way towards mitigating this, IMO. I think we should do that immediately (and uplift it to 57), and then look into further improvements (either (1) or (2) above) as a followup for 58 or later.

Another interesting POC is using %e30%80%80 instead of %20. Pretty much any recognized whitespace.
To avoid decoding these, it may be enough to fix losslessDecodeURI that currently skips whitespaces on purpose, probably for beautification reasons.
I can try to patch it and see if any tests are failing. It will also need a test for these 2 cases, at least.Assignee: adw → mak77Flags: needinfo?(past)

And here comes back [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow") that makes cropping in the middle a nightmare. It may be easier to actually split the scheme considered that bug is open from 6 years and the proposals got few interest in W3C.
At this point I agree with [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), let's just show the encoded whitespaces and I'll file a separate public bug about cropping the urls better.

Attached patch

[don't decode whitespaces](attachment.cgi?id=8917347&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8917347&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8917347)

This just avoids decoding whitespaces, so they will stay % encoded.
Cropping is a more complex problem we'd better handle separately, I suggest a normal public bug in the Address Bar for that.
Does this sound sufficiently good to you?

Decoding whitespaces is a nice UX win. Can we refuse to decode them only when there's more than N of them, or a run of more than N of them, or something?

We will keep decoding them for javascript or exotic urls, the change only affects http, https, file and ftp schemes. For these I'm not sure there's any UX win.
While your suggestion is technically feasible, it would make the behavior more unpredictable and maybe even surprising, imo.

Really? I'd say that:

Fwiw, all the wikis I tried rewrite %20 to underscores, makes more sense imo, web devs should use underscores if they care about readability of their urls. Your example in reality would be <https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/CA_Information_Checklist>
To look into the other browsers, and understand if we're breaking users expectations: Chrome doesn't decode %20, as well as Edge. I don't have Safari at hand atm.
How would you measure the right N? The window and, as a consequence, the Address Bar, can be small. To hide the smaller host possible you may not need a lot of spaces, indeed even if invalid per RFC, some dns may support single letter hostnames.
If we only care to mitigate the problem, we could maybe allow single isolated spaces.
Let's see what the others think.

FWIW, I too think it would be preferable to find a way to keep decoding spaces in the "non-spoofy" cases for UX reasons, even if that makes the behaviour less predictable, because it'll keep the 'nice' behaviour for the common case while defeating spoofing attempts (if done right :-) ).

The only "right" way I can think of currently is to decode only isolated whitespaces.

Even if, something like "<http://fake.domain> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . real.domain" (or some unicode glyph even more subtle than a dot) could still be quite confusing.

The correct fix here is making sure that the real domain is always visible. Combine that with domain highlighting, and we are fine even if spaces are not decoded at all. Let's focus on that. If we want to stopgap by refusing to decode long runs of spaces, let's do it. But we are already at the edge case of edge cases. Phishers don't bother with this stuff for good reasons. It works fine without.

If we want the fix in 57 the only way would be to hide the scheme, and I'm not sure we're comfortable with that.
If we can wait, then surely we could look into the static scheme solution (that off-hand looks easier than waiting for [Bug 740910](/show_bug.cgi?id=740910 "NEW - Support cropping in the middle for text-overflow")).

How about a regex something like
/%(?!3B|2F|3F|3A|40|26|3D|2B|24|2C|23)|\s(?=\s)|\s$/
This would mean we'll encode any whitespaces that are followed by a further whitespace, or that occur at the end of the URL. (I'd have liked to catch any whitespaces -preceded- by another whitespace, too, but that would have needed a lookbehind assertion, which AFAIK isn't available in JS regex.)
I agree the proper solution is to make sure the real domain is always visible and highlighted, but I don't think we're going to fix that for 57, so I'd suggest doing a whitespace fix like this as an interim fix that could be safely uplifted (also to ESR if desired).

We should still always encode \r\t\n, even if they are not followed by another whitespace char. In my patch I just replaced them with \s because it was a catch-all solution. Surely it could be adapted, something like [\r\n\t]|\s(?=\s)|\s$
Though, gerv is right the only real solution is to show and hilight the real domain. I was looking for an "almost whitespace char" to see the effect. Replacing isolated spaces in this case doesn't help much, and I didn't search the whole unicode.

At that point, we're getting into territory that's more like the "barely noticeable combining mark" cases -- a glyph that is unambiguously visible (assuming non-broken fonts!), but nevertheless easily overlooked by users who aren't accustomed to noticing it.

Considering the approvals for 57 were just made strict to the point of "only if it may cause a chemspill release", I'd say we will just skip the stopgap solution.

Attached patch

[patch v2](attachment.cgi?id=8919079&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8919079&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8919079)

This is a possible patch. It still lacks tests, but I'd first like to collect some feedback.
\* multiple spaces are encoded as suggested by jfkthame, single spaces are not, so we retain ux advantage.
\* the address bar gradient is on the left or on the right, depending on the overflow direction.
\* there is an overlay label that always shows the scheme when it is overflowed and the url has a host.
\* I didn't use ellipsis because it's impossible without proper text-overflow support. If we'd have a text-overflow where one could define at which char to put the ellipsis, it would be trivial.
I tested this with an ltr long url, and this rtl-host long url, in ltr, rtl and dark theme modes. In all the cases both the scheme and the host are visible and the gradient is on the right side.
The code is not the cleanest, because while it's true we can set the selection to the end of the "scheme://", that still creates situations where the url is overflowed on both sides when moving between states.
It would be much simpler if we'd strip the scheme, but that creates more risks of regressions when we have to put it back, and we'd only strip some schemes, that would make things even more foggy.
Another alternative I tried, was to create a special kind of selection like SELECTION\_OMIT, that would not be drawn to the textrun. Then I could set that on the scheme, and always show the scheme in the separate label. It should be less regression prone, since the actual input value wouldn't change.
Unfortunately I'm not very good at layout code, I successfully introduced the selection type globally, but my changes to nsTextFrame.cpp didn't seem to work. Thus I don't know if it would properly align. Regardless, I'd need help implementing the omit selection type in the text frame, if we want to try that approach.
What do you think?

I tried this patch in a local build (based on current m-c tip), and while it seems like a possible way forward, I observed a couple of glitches that will need further work. As a testcase, I took the URL generated by the PoC here ([comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references")).
(a) When I paste this URL into the address bar of a new tab and press Enter, it is displayed with the https:// scheme visible (as expected), but then the URL is left-aligned, meaning that the fake "no.io" domain (actually part of the fragment id) appears after the scheme, followed by the sequence of spaces (all but one %20-encoded). The same occurs if I navigate to the URL by choosing it from the History menu. Also, note that the fade-out gradient is missing at this point.
(b) If I switch to a different tab, and then return to my test tab with the long URL, it now displays right-aligned, so that the real domain (اسماء.شبكة) is visible. However, the sequence of %20-encoded spaces in the fragment identifier are overprinting the still-visible scheme.
I'll attach screenshots of (a) and (b) as seen on my system.

Personally, I'd still favor doing a minimal patch that %-encodes multiple spaces (i.e. just the regex change in function losslessDecodeURI) and trying to uplift that to 57, as I think it's a useful mitigation with minimal risk. Then all further improvements would go into a future release. But I recognize I'm not an owner/peer here, so it's not my call.

No, I wasn't aware of that. Just tried it, though, and I'm still seeing the issues. The exact result (a) seems to vary -- a couple of times, it's appeared with the gradient on the scheme at the left, though still showing the wrong part of the URL; case (b) with the overpainted scheme after switching tabs seems consistently reproducible.

Ah, problem b) is related to the fact I was testing using Dark Theme. The css needs some tweaks for the default theme.
Problem a) seems to depend on whether the text was already overflowed before pasting.

This definitely looks better; I can no longer reproduce (b) at all, AFAICT.
I can still see some behavioral glitches, though, including a form of (a) in certain circumstances. I'll try to give STR that reliably misbehave for me:
(a) Visit the test URL from the PoC in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), so that it gets into History.
Open a new browser window (NOT a new tab in the same window).
Choose the test site's from the History menu.
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, so the wrong part of it (the fake "no.io") is visible.
Note that this only seems to happen for the first tab in a window.
(b) Visit the test URL from the PoC.
Copy the entire long URL to the clipboard.
Paste it back into the URL bar (overwriting the copy that's already there).
Press Enter to confirm ("navigating" to the page we're already on).
>> The URL is displayed left-aligned, with a fade applied to the left-hand end.
>> Also, note that the https:// scheme label is missing.

Thank you, that was useful, all the reported issues should be fixed.
I'm not 100% sure about the text misalignment, since so far I only tested on Win, but I changed the alignment approach for a simple box centering.
I'll start looking into what I can add a test for.

I agree. This patch is a bit hard to evaluate since it tries to do different mostly unrelated things, there are many edge cases to consider, and the code isn't the cleanest, as Marco admitted. Can we just encode spaces here and move the other ideas to followups?Flags: needinfo?(dao+bmo)

The newest patch is much cleaner, surely there are a few edge cases, but in practice it relies on the formatting code now, that is well tested. Have a look at it, I think it's a pretty good MVP.
We can surely land the fixed at different times, but there are 2 reasons I didn't:
1. uplifiting to 57 is very unlikely, per rel-eng decisions, so the benefit of splitting for 58 is minor
2. even with the whitespaces fix, the bug is not really fixed, since the host is still not visible. It would make the url less confusable just for more savvy users. And by landing the first part we'd practically expose the problem without having the final fix at hand.

I tested briefly again with the new patch; this is definitely a lot more stable. At this point, I've only noticed a couple of relatively minor glitches (again, I'm testing on a Mac, in case this has any significance):
1. Open a new window.
2. Load the test URL from the PoC above (the "fake no.io").
> It displays correctly, with the Arabic-script domain visible at the right, the scheme visible at the left, and the long URL truncated (with fade-out) before it hits the scheme
3. Now, assume we want to edit the URL. So click in it, let's say at the dot in the domain name.
> The focus goes to the URL bar, and the entire URL is selected
> HOWEVER, sometimes (maybe one in three or four times, the URL "jumps" horizontally so that the domain is no longer visible, and I'm looking at a run of encoded spaces (%20%20%20%20...)
4a. Click in the (now-selected) URL a second time, to place an insertion point for editing.
> If the URL didn't "jump-scroll" in the previous step, this behaves fine. If it did, the insertion point seems to be misplaced by a few characters from where I clicked.
4b. Instead of clicking in the selected URL to begin editing, I change my mind and click back in the content of the page.
> The URL bar loses focus, but in the process its content momentarily jumps to the wrong end of its scroll range, before reverting to the expected right-aligned scroll position. This produces a distracting visual flicker as the text skips back and forth.

I fear the jumping issue is due to the underlying editor and I'd not have much control over that from the urlbar code.
If it just happens for overflowed urls with RTL domains, it sounds like an edge case, so we may ignore it for now. I'll have a look at it.

This may be unavoidable unless we have a way to tell if the first char after the scheme is RTL. Do you know if we have something like that exposed to js?

After some testing, I think this is a bug somewhere in the editor or the selection code, that is uncovered by the rtl selection. Indeed the only thing we do is a call to .selectAll(). I don't have much control over that, but it seems rare enough to not be a blocker.

It's not limited to cases that involve RTL; I've also seen it with purely LTR long URLs. But on checking, I find that I can also reproduce it (intermittently) in a current nightly (i.e. without the patch here), in the existing URL bar. So as you say, it's not an issue with this patch; it seems to be a bug elsewhere in editor/selection handling.

Drive-by (sorry) - this should have a check against re-entrancy (ditto for the further-nested updates a bit further down).

I'm afraid the whole .urlbar-scheme-box[scheme][textoverflow="start"] thing is an edge case. :/
It will be easy to regress and we won't necessarily catch that in nightly testing.

With the whitespce fix, this bug doesn't seem severe enough to me to be concerned about that. But we can land without a commit message and keep this bug marked security-sensitive for as long as we want.

Hmm, this isn't how SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY works. It explicitly doesn't use the alpha channel since this might get us grayscale anti-aliasing:

It is sort-of an edge case, but this bug is about an edge case.
I agree it's something we may miss in Nightly, that's why I added a test, so we don't regress.

If dveditz is fine with that, no problem on my side.
I still think not showing the domain doesn't really fix anything for the non-technical users, it will just be a weak indicator: "something looks strange, but I see a host here".
But for the next version I will split the patch into the 2 parts.

I want to address the re-entrancy Gijs pointed out and re-test for this tab switching case, I didn't see it on Win/Mac.
I suppose the 1px offset is not a critical problem, considered as you said this is an edge case, and security comes first.

I know, but I have no way to reproduce what the textframe is doing.
Is it critical to have subpixel AA in a small label shown in edge cases? Any alternative suggestion on how to achieve that?

If we want to commit to doing this, I'd rather do it right. These kind of glitches that aren't covered by the test and will only add up over time are exactly what concerns me.

Perhaps use a textframe with SELECTION\_URLSECONDARY?

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1395508&attachment=8926403)

This is the part we agree upon: don't decode consecutive spaces. It preserves UX for urls having single spaces to separate words, but makes long runs of spaces visible and likely warnings the user something may be wrong.
I'm still looking at the second part (always show the domain) to see if I can reproduce the reported intermittent issues.
Daniel, would you be fine with landing the first part for now, so that consecutive spaces are shown encoded, and keep the second part for later when we are more comfortable with it?
Do you think there's risk exposing a partial fix to the problem?

I'd leave the reference to that old bug and tweak the wording a bit:
"Re-encode select whitespace so that it doesn't get eaten away by the location bar ([bug 410726](/show_bug.cgi?id=410726 "RESOLVED FIXED - address bar eats escaped newlines")). Re-encode all adjacent whitespace to prevent spoofing attempts where invisible characters would push part of the URL to overflow the location bar."
Maybe also add a reference to this bug. Blame is a bit annoying here because these lines tend to get touched again and again.

I've updated the comment locally, though now it's basically exposing what this bug is about and how to reproduce it.
Imo that forces us to move the remaining work to a separate bug. Let's see what Daniel thinks.

This fixes the opacity AA, the alignment and the re-entrancy. I didn't have a chance to test the Linux intermittent problem. Testing is welcome.

I agree w/Dão that we shouldn't remove the old bug reference and should add a reference to this bug.
Should be fine to land just this part -- spaces are already known to be spoofy and nothing here references the RTL aspect.

Can we add a test with two embedded spaces (possibly different ones, like %20%C2%A0) to show the expected "%20 " behavior and not " %C2%A0"?

What did you update the comment to? If you take the comment I saw and just stick "([bug 1395508](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"))" on the end it's not revealing the key part of this. Even if it does I'd prefer keeping the work in this bug. Something like

should be fine, and then keep the remaining work in this bug.

We will actually show "%20%C2%A0" and not " %C2%A0" because they are considered consecutive spaces and thus re-encoded by this patch. I still added the test, I hope it's ok, it should be from the point of view of this report.

I tried to reproduce and verify the fix of this issue. Based on [Comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), I suppose that the fixed builds should displayed the real domain (سماء.شبكة). Compared with Chrome, where the real domain is always in focus, on Firefox the domain is displayed only at the end of the URL (can be seen only by using the horizontal scroll). Not sure what the fix should be here! Am I missing something?

Yes, the "always show domain" fix didn't land here but has been moved to [bug 1419391](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419391 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox address bar spoof using RTL language and references"), because the patch is fragile due to missing editor APIs and there's some discussion about a completely new approach for the Address Bar that would be less likely to suffer from spoofing attempts. That didn't happen yet.
What landed here is the patch that decodes multiple whitespaces when they are adjacent, that by itself makes the user less likely to fall for the spoofing attempt since there's no long empty space after the fake domain making it look good.Flags: needinfo?(mak77)
