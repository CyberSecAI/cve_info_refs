{
  "CVE-2018-5968": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485 in jackson-databind, allowing unsafe deserialization through the use of c3p0 libraries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization",
      "Incomplete blacklist for preventing deserialization of malicious objects"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to the ability to deserialize and instantiate malicious objects.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper.",
      "Leveraging polymorphic type handling methods like `enableDefaultTyping()` or @JsonTypeInfo using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted JSON payload to an application that uses a vulnerable version of jackson-databind."
