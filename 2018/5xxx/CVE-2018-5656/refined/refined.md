Combined with CSRF, an attacker can trick an admin into performing actions without their consent.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript payloads into vulnerable plugin parameters.",
       "CSRF: By crafting a malicious HTML page that sends a forged request to the vulnerable plugin."
    ],
