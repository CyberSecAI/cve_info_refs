Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-5461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an inadequate encryption strength in the web interface of the affected Hirschmann Classic Platform Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate encryption strength (CWE-326). The specific encryption algorithms used or their implementation is weak, making them susceptible to attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by intercepting network traffic (man-in-the-middle attack) due to the weak encryption.
- An attacker might achieve a limited ability to modify data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the web interface of the affected devices.
- Man-in-the-middle attack (eavesdropping on network traffic).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network where they can intercept the traffic between the user and the affected device's web interface.
- High skill level is required to exploit, as described in the advisory.
- No user interaction is explicitly needed for the exploitation according to the CVSS vector provided in the advisory, but a man-in-the-middle position is implied.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions that this vulnerability was reported by Ilya Karpov, Evgeniy Druzhinin, Mikhail Tsvetkov, and Damir Zainullin of Positive Technologies.
- The affected products include multiple series of Hirschmann Classic Platform Switches such as RS, RSR, RSB, MACH100, MACH1000, MACH4000, MS, and OCTOPUS.
- The advisory provides mitigation steps such as disabling HTTP, using HTTPS or SSH, using complex passwords, restricting access by IP address, and disabling remote access when not in use.
- CVSS v3 score is 6.5 with vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
