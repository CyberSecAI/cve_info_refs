Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WebExtension Find API was not restricted from searching privileged pages (such as `about:debugging`) open in tabs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious WebExtension could use the Find API to search for and potentially extract sensitive information from privileged pages, which are normally protected from access by extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker could gain access to potentially sensitive data displayed on privileged `about:` pages (e.g., debugging information).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WebExtension:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious WebExtension installed by a user.
- **User Action:** The user must have a privileged `about:` page open in a tab for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to create and distribute a malicious WebExtension.
- The attacker must rely on the user to install the malicious extension.
- The user must open a privileged page in a tab for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "moderate" in severity.
- The fix implemented restricts the Find API from searching any `about:` pages by checking if the scheme is "about" and also checking `contentPrincipal.isSystemPrincipal`
- The fix also includes a test case.
