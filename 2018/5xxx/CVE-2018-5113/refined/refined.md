Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper enforcement of URL schemes within the `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions. This function, intended to load content only over `https:`, did not prevent loading of other schemes like `about:` or `file:`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate input validation:** The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function failed to validate the provided URL, allowing non-HTTPS URLs to be used.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By loading privileged `about:` pages or local `file:` URLs, an extension could potentially gain access to resources or functionalities it normally wouldn't have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Privileged Pages:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to open privileged `about:` pages within the extension context.
*   **Potential for Further Exploits:** This vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities, like XSS in `about:` pages, to create a more severe security exploit (as noted in the bug report).
*   **Data leakage:** The vulnerability could also allow to open local file URLs, potentially leading to data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebExtension:** An attacker would create a malicious WebExtension that uses `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` with a non-HTTPS URL.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to install the malicious extension. Once installed, the extension can then open privileged pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create WebExtensions:** The attacker must be able to create and package a malicious WebExtension.
*   **Ability to Persuade Users to Install the Malicious Extension:** The attacker needs to convince a user to install their malicious extension.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was rated as "sec-moderate" severity.
*   The fix involves limiting the API arguments via schema validation by enforcing the use of `https:` URLs.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 59 and backported to Firefox 58 beta.
*   The vulnerability was reported externally.
*   The bug report mentions that while this specific vulnerability wasn't seen as highly dangerous alone, it could be combined with other vulnerabilities to create a more serious attack.
