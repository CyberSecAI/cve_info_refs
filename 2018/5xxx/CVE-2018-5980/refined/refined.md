Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5980:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `exploit-db.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2018-5980 and describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in Joomla! Component Solidres version 2.5.1. This aligns with the provided CVE ID, confirming the content is related.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the Solidres component, specifically within the `hub.search` task. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to a complete compromise of the application and database.
    - The `exploit-db.com` content highlights that an attacker could use the vulnerability to extract information from the database, as shown by the base64 encoded SQL payload.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the `index.php` entry point of Joomla!, specifically targeting the `com_solidres` component.
    - The vulnerable parameters are within the URL, particularly those related to the `hub.search` task and potentially the `ordering` and `direction` parameters, as indicated by the exploit examples.
    - The `exploit-db.com` content provides example URLs demonstrating where the SQL injection can be placed within the query parameters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
    - No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability as it is exploitable through the URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example provided in `exploit-db.com` indicates that the vulnerability is triggered through manipulating the `direction` and `ordering` parameters when searching through the `hub.search` task.
*   The provided SQL payload is encoded in base64, when decoded, reveals the malicious SQL query. The payload is: `SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71626a7171,(SELECT (ELT(4561=4561,1))),0x716b706271,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x` which attempts to extract data from the database.

*   The version of Solidres affected is 2.5.1 according to the exploit-db.com entry. The Joomla extension page indicates a more current version, but does not state that the vulnerability is patched. This may indicate that a newer version is required to remediate the SQLi.
