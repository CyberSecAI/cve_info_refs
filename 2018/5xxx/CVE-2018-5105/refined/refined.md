Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles filenames when downloading and opening files using the WebExtensions API. Specifically, the `downloads.download` and `downloads.open` APIs, when combined with a filename containing a null byte (`\x00`), bypass the checks that prevent execution of potentially dangerous files, such as executables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Filename Manipulation:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of a WebExtension to include a null byte in the filename when using `downloads.download`.
2.  **Inadequate Executable Check:** The `nsLocalFile::IsExecutable` function in `nsLocalFileWin.cpp` uses a blacklist-based check. It fails to recognize filenames containing a null byte as potentially dangerous executable files, leading to a bypass.
3.  **Missing Extension Validation:** The WebExtension layer in `ext-downloads.js` or the `nsLocalFile::IsExecutable` in `nsLocalFileWin.cpp` failed to properly validate the file extension to detect potentially dangerous files.
4. **Bypass of user prompt**: The download prompt is only guarded behind whether a file is "executable". When the check fails, the file is opened with the system's default action without any warning to the user.
5.  **downloads.open with no user gesture requirement before Firefox 56:** Extensions could open tabs and potentially trick users to click within those tabs which triggered the vulnerable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious WebExtension could download an executable file (e.g., a `.bat` file), and then open and execute it without user interaction (before Firefox 56) or with minimal user interaction (after Firefox 56) by leveraging the null byte injection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Since the extension can execute the downloaded file, it can perform actions with the privileges of the user running the browser.
*   **Bypassing Security Warnings:** The normal security warning associated with running executable files is circumvented, creating a stealthy attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WebExtensions:** An attacker could create a malicious WebExtension and distribute it through the Firefox Add-ons store or other channels.
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker can trick a user into installing the malicious extension which can trigger the vulnerable download and open functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WebExtension Development Skills:** The attacker must be able to develop a WebExtension that leverages the `downloads.download` and `downloads.open` APIs.
*   **Ability to distribute the malicious extension**: An attacker must be able to distribute the malicious extension to victim machines.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered in Firefox 55.0.1 and 57.0a1.
*   A user gesture requirement was added to `downloads.open` in Firefox beta (56).
*   The fix was implemented in bug 1402279.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 58.
*   The affected functions were located in `DownloadIntegration.jsm` and `nsLocalFileWin.cpp`.
