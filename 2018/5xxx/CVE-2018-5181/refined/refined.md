Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-5181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a failure to properly enforce security policies when handling drag-and-drop operations involving `file:` URLs. Specifically, when a `file:` URL is dragged from one browser tab to another, especially a tab opened with `rel=noopener`, the browser incorrectly allows the target tab to load the local file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed Same-Origin Policy:** The primary vulnerability is a bypass of the same-origin policy.  The browser should not allow a web page, even in a noopener tab, to access local files using a `file:` URL that originated from another origin.
*   **Incorrect Principal Handling**: When a file URL is dragged and dropped to a new tab, the new tab does not use the principal of the originating document, and therefore inappropriately grants the new tab access to local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page with a link to a local file and trick a user into dragging this link to a new tab (especially if the tab is opened with "noopener"). This would cause the browser to load the local file, potentially revealing sensitive information on the user's file system.
*   **Limited Impact:** The vulnerability's impact is mitigated by the fact that the file is loaded in a noopener context, which has limited interaction with the opener. However, the local file's contents are still exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and Drop:** The attack vector is user-initiated drag-and-drop of a hyperlink containing a `file:` URL from a web page to a new tab.
*   **Target Tab:** Specifically, this vulnerability is easily triggered when the target tab is opened with `rel=noopener`, which often causes the tab to run in a separate process, where principal information is lost.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user's action of dragging and dropping a crafted link, making it a social engineering vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious web page.
*   **Crafted Link:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a hyperlink containing a `file:` URL.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to trick the user into dragging the link into a new tab.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was present due to a deficiency in the handling of drag and drop events in the context of e10s (Electrolysis or multi-process architecture)
*   The fix involved ensuring that principal information is passed along when dragging between content processes.
*   The bug was classified as "sec-low" severity and did not warrant a security bounty.

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, how it could be exploited, and its potential impact.
