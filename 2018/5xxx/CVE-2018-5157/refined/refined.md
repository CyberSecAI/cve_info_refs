  "CVE-2018-5157": {
    "description": "The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker. Also same-origin protections for the PDF viewer can be bypassed, allowing a malicious site to intercept messages meant for the viewer. This could allow the site to retrieve PDF files restricted to viewing by an authenticated user on a third-party website.",
    "vulnerability": "The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, and same-origin protections can be bypassed",
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code with PDF viewer permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to PDF files, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or exfiltration of data.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted PDF file or malicious website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious PDF or host a malicious website to exploit this vulnerability."
