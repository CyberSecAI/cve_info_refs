Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5704

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- OpenOCD, a JTAG debugger, did not properly restrict HTTP POST requests to localhost.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-protocol scripting (XPS) vulnerability: OpenOCD's HTTP server allowed arbitrary HTTP POST requests, which could be used to conduct cross-protocol scripting attacks.
- Default binding to all network interfaces: OpenOCD by default was listening on all network interfaces, not just localhost.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers could craft a malicious webpage, and when a victim running OpenOCD visits this webpage, the attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious webpage and tricking a user running OpenOCD to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page or control a web page that a victim using the vulnerable OpenOCD visits.
- The victim must be running OpenOCD with its HTTP server enabled.
