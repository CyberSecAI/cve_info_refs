Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-5404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the KACE System Management Appliance (SMA) that allows for Blind SQL Injection. This is caused by the improper handling of user-provided input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89). This means an attacker can inject SQL code but cannot directly see the results of their queries, requiring them to infer information based on the application's responses (or lack thereof).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation of the blind SQL injection could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
- **Full Database Copy:** The vulnerability could also be exploited to copy the entire database, potentially exposing all stored data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Authenticated Attack:** Exploitation requires the attacker to be authenticated to the KACE System Management Appliance.
- **Least Privileged User:**  An attacker with a "User Console Only" role can exploit the vulnerability, meaning even users with limited privileges could perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the KACE SMA.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the KACE SMA as a user with at least "User Console Only" privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities reported by CERT Coordination Center, including CVE-2018-5405 (Stored XSS) and CVE-2018-5406 (Misconfigured CORS).
- The vulnerability is addressed in KACE SMA version 9.1 and later.
- The vendor, Quest, recommends upgrading to the latest version to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
