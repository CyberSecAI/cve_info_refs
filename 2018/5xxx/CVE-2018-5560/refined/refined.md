Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Guardzilla IoT video camera firmware contains hard-coded Amazon S3 credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The device uses hardcoded AWS S3 access keys and secret keys within the firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to all video data stored in the Amazon S3 buckets associated with the hardcoded credentials. This includes video data of all users of the Guardzilla system.
- Potential for information disclosure, as attackers can access video feeds stored by other users.
- Attackers could potentially modify or delete stored video data, though this is not explicitly mentioned.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Once the hardcoded credentials are extracted, an attacker can access the AWS S3 buckets from anywhere with internet access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to firmware:** The attacker needs to extract the firmware of the Guardzilla camera.
- **Static analysis:** Requires skills in static analysis to extract the access keys and crack the root password.
- **AWS knowledge:** Knowledge of AWS S3 and how to use access keys.
