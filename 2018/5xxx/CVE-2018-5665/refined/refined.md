  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in the 'responsive-coming-soon-page' WordPress plugin.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in multiple input fields.",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to lack of CSRF protection."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions. Combining with the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can trick an admin user into making changes within the plugin by visiting a malicious page and submitting a form, potentially gaining full control over the site or performing malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "xss": "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into specific input fields in the plugin's settings page, an attacker can achieve stored XSS. The vulnerable fields include `coming-soon_title`, `coming-soon_sub_title`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`, `bg_color`, `button_text_link`, `social_icon_1`, `counter_title_icon`, and `counter_title`.",
      "csrf": "The CSRF vulnerability can be exploited by tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious web page, which contains a crafted form that submits to the vulnerable plugin's settings page."

    "attacker_capabilities": {
         "xss": "The attacker needs to be able to insert a malicious payload into one of the vulnerable input fields, which in this case would be done via the vulnerable admin panel.",
         "csrf": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the administrator into accessing a page under the attacker's control. The attacker must also have knowledge of the structure of the request that needs to be crafted."
