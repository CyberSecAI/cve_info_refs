Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-5551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the `DTISQLInstaller.exe` installer of DocuTrac's QuicDoc and Office Therapy software. The installer creates three database accounts with static, well-known credentials during the setup process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The installer includes the usernames and passwords for database accounts directly within its code.
*   **Static Credentials:**  The same credentials (QDMaster/dti.93.qd!, OTMaster/dti.93.ot!, and sa/myDTI123) are used across all installations of the software.
*   **Lack of User Control:** End users are not informed about these accounts and cannot change the passwords without impacting the application's functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** Attackers can use these hard-coded credentials to gain unauthorized access to the backend SQL server database, where sensitive patient and billing information is stored. This includes names, addresses, SSNs, prescriptions, therapy notes, credit card data, insurance information, and bank accounts.
*   **Potential Host Compromise:** The `sa` account provides system administrator level access to the SQL server. Attackers can use this to further compromise the host operating system by potentially using stored procedures like `xp_cmdshell` or `sp_add_job` to execute commands on the server.
*   **Data Breach:** The potential for exfiltration and misuse of the sensitive medical and billing information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers with network access to the database server can use the hard-coded credentials to directly connect to the database and gain access to the data.
*   **SQL Injection (Potentially):** The article does not explicitly mention SQL injection; however, given the compromised database credentials, it's a relevant consideration since attackers could use the database access for further malicious activities if the application is also susceptible to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the SQL server to leverage the hard-coded database credentials.
*   **Database Knowledge (For System Level Exploitation):** Basic understanding of SQL Server administration and potentially advanced knowledge of stored procedures (e.g., `xp_cmdshell`) would be necessary to fully compromise the system via the `sa` account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through static analysis of the installer executable.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Critical with a CVSSv3 score of 9.0
*   The affected software is used in medical billing and documentation, making the exposure of patient and billing data particularly critical.
