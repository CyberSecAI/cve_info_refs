{
  "CVE-2018-5953": {
    "Root cause": "The `swiotlb_print_info` function in the Linux kernel's swiotlb subsystem prints kernel memory addresses to the system log.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can obtain sensitive kernel memory addresses. These addresses can help in exploiting other vulnerabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": "By reading the system log (dmesg), a local user can obtain the memory addresses printed by the swiotlb subsystem.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user able to read the system log."
  }
