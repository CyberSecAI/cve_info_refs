The provided content details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the "responsive-coming-soon-page" WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation when saving plugin settings. The plugin does not properly filter user-supplied data for several parameters before storing them, allowing malicious HTML and JavaScript code to be injected into the database.
- Lack of CSRF protection on the settings page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** Multiple parameters within the plugin's settings page are vulnerable to XSS. Specifically, when the admin user saves the plugin options, several fields are not sanitized which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. These include: `coming-soon_title`, `coming-soon_sub_title`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`, `bg_color`, `button_text_link`, `social_icon_1`, `counter_title_icon`, and `counter_title`.
- **CSRF:**  The plugin's settings page lacks CSRF protection, enabling an attacker to trick an admin user into submitting malicious requests, thus triggering the stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. When an admin user visits a page where this data is displayed (e.g., the coming soon page), the injected script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal the admin user's session cookie
    - Redirect the user to a malicious site
    - Perform actions on behalf of the admin user
    - Deface the site or otherwise cause harm
- **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in admin user, will force the user's browser to send a request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page with attacker-controlled values. This can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to execute malicious javascript.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker crafts malicious input, containing javascript code within specific parameters, and saves these settings via the plugin's settings page.
- **CSRF:** An attacker creates a malicious HTML page and tricks a logged-in admin user into visiting it. The HTML page contains a form that, upon submission, sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **XSS:** The attacker must have the ability to modify plugin settings, typically requiring admin or equivalent access to the WordPress dashboard.
- **CSRF:** The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a crafted webpage.
