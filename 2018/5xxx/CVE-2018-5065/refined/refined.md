Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-5065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error, specifically within the handling of the JPEG2000 image format within the JP2KLib.dll library used by Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior. In this case, a memory region is deallocated, but a pointer to that memory is still used, resulting in a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means they could potentially gain full control of the affected system by running malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted PDF Files:** The primary attack vector involves using a specially crafted PDF document. The crafted PDF includes a malicious JPEG2000 image that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability during parsing by the vulnerable library within Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create or Obtain Malicious PDF:** The attacker must be able to create, modify, or obtain a malicious PDF file that contains a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
- **Victim Must Open the Malicious PDF:** The victim needs to open this malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader for the exploit to trigger.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also describes the methodology used by Check Point researchers to find the vulnerability using fuzzing, including the creation of a harness to target a specific library (JP2KLib.dll) within Adobe Reader. This harness allowed them to effectively test the JPEG2000 parser and uncover the use-after-free flaw, as well as other vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is identified as a "critical" severity issue by Adobe.
- The researchers discovered multiple vulnerabilities by using their fuzzing techniques, with CVE-2018-5065 just being one of them.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader across Windows and macOS.
