{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before storing them in the database or displaying them on the page, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Additionally, the application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website. CSRF vulnerabilities can enable attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user, such as changing settings or modifying data.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "XSS": "Malicious payloads are injected through various input fields, including keyword, contact, cast, movie name, snacks name, and news title. These are then stored and executed when the relevant pages are viewed by other users.",
    "CSRF": "A crafted HTML page can be used to send requests to the application, potentially modifying data or performing actions without the user's explicit knowledge or consent."
  },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": {
    "XSS": "An attacker needs to be able to submit data to the vulnerable input fields, which typically requires access to the admin panel or other user input locations.",
    "CSRF": "An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious HTML page while the user is logged into the vulnerable application."
  }
