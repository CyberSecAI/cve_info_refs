- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77). A remote attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges, leading to full control of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and requires low skill to exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges or user interaction.
