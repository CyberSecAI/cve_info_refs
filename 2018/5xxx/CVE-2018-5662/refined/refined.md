The provided content details Stored XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in the "responsive-coming-soon-page" WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Insufficient input sanitization when saving plugin settings. Several parameters, including `coming-soon_title`, `coming-soon_sub_title`, `logo_width`, `logo_height`, `bg_color`, `button_text_link`, `social_icon_1`, `counter_title_icon` and `counter_title` do not filter out malicious input allowing injection of JavaScript.
*   **CSRF:** Lack of CSRF protection when saving plugin settings. The plugin does not validate the origin of the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of users visiting the admin settings page.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can forge requests to modify plugin settings if they can trick an authenticated admin user into submitting a form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   The attacker can potentially hijack the admin's session, steal cookies or perform unauthorized actions within the admin interface.
    *   The attacker could redirect the admin to a malicious page or deface the administrative interface.
*  **CSRF:**
    *   An attacker can modify plugin settings, potentially injecting malicious scripts through the Stored XSS vulnerability.
    *   The attacker could change the site configuration or create backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker crafts malicious input and submits it through the plugin's settings form. This code is then stored by the plugin and executed when an admin visits the settings page.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker creates a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting a request to the vulnerable admin page. If an authenticated admin visits the attacker's page, the form is automatically submitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the settings page of the vulnerable WordPress plugin and save malicious input.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated admin user to visit a malicious webpage they control. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to carry out a CSRF attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided examples demonstrate how the vulnerabilities can be exploited. The payload `onfocus=console.log(/xss[number]/) autofocus test="123"` is used to demonstrate the injection and execution of JavaScript, while the CSRF exploit shows a crafted HTML form submitted to the vulnerable admin endpoint.
*   The content explicitly mentions the vulnerabilities were tested on WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the plugin at the time of the report.
