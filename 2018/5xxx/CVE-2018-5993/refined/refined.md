Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `com_aist` component of Joomla. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (SQLi).
* **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control of the server depending on the database permissions and the application's configuration.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
    *   Vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_aist&view=showvacancy&id=[SQL]`
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
    *   The attacker does not need any authentication.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads.
