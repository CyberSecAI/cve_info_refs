{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `quicktake_100_load_raw()` function in `internal/dcraw_common.cpp` due to improper bounds checking of input image dimensions. When processing specially crafted RAW image data, the function allocates a buffer on the stack based on user-supplied width and height without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted RAW image data",
      "Processing user supplied input"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted RAW image file that triggers the overflow. No special privileges or network access is required."
