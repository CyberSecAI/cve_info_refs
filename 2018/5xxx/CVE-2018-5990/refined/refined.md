- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla! Component AllVideos Reloaded 1.2.x is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability in the `divid` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data extraction, modification or deletion, potentially compromising the entire database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `option=com_avreloaded`, `view=popup`, and a malicious SQL injection payload in the `divid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance.
