Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! MediaLibrary Free component is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `view_author` task and the `mid` parameter in the `lend_request` task are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive information)
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    *   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or server by injecting malicious code to be executed by the database server if the database has such permissions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests by manipulating the vulnerable `id` and `mid` parameters.
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php?option=com_medialibrary&task=view_author&id=[SQL]`
    *   `http://localhost/[PATH]/index.php/component/medialibrary/0/lend_request?Itemid=0&mid[0]=[SQL]`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection.
