Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2725-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : lrzip
Version        : 0.631-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-8844 CVE-2017-8846 CVE-2017-9928 CVE-2017-9929
                 CVE-2018-5650 CVE-2018-5747 CVE-2018-5786 CVE-2018-10685
                 CVE-2018-11496

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in lrzip, a compression
program. Heap-based and stack buffer overflows, use-after-free and infinite
loops would allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly other
unspecified impact via a crafted file.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.631-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your lrzip packages.

For the detailed security status of lrzip please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/lrzip>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# use-after-free in ucompthread (src/stream.c)Â #90

## Description

[![@ProbeFuzzer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35150299?v=4&size=48)](/ProbeFuzzer)[ProbeFuzzer](https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer)opened [on Jan 17, 2018](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/issues/90#issue-289322575)

on 0.631 (the latest version) and the latest master branch:

there is a use-after-free problem in the ucompthread function (src/stream.c) that causes the program to crash. Note that this issue is caused by the memory free of "ucthread", which is different from [CVE-2017-8846](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7qpf-hv34-vvr8 "CVE-2017-8846") ([#71](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip/issues/71)) casued by memory free of "stream\_info \*sinfo".

This issue can be triggered by the POC with command lrzip -t $POC

POC: <https://github.com/ProbeFuzzer/poc/blob/master/lrzip/lrzip_0-631_lrzip_use-after-free_ucompthread.lrz>

The problem happens in line 1519 of stream.c file. Once "ucthread" is released, "uci" points to a random address, resulting in segmentation fault.

1513 uci = &ucthread[i];

...

1518 retry:

1519 if (uci->c\_type != CTYPE\_NONE) {

1520 switch (uci->c\_type) {

1521 case CTYPE\_LZMA:
