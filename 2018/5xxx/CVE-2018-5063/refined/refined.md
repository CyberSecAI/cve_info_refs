Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-5063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This type of error occurs when a program attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer or array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core weakness is that the software reads data from a memory location that it is not supposed to, leading to potential information disclosure or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory space.
*   The advisory also states that successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities, including out-of-bounds write, heap overflow, use-after-free, type confusion, untrusted pointer dereference and buffer errors, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, specifically while processing a maliciously crafted file. The specific format is not explicitly stated in the advisory, but according to the Checkpoint research article, it was found during fuzzing of the JP2K image parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to create a malicious file that, when opened by a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   The attacker must convince a user to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software. This could be done via email, website or other distribution channels.

**Additional Notes from the Check Point Research:**

*   The vulnerability was found through fuzzing, a method of testing software by feeding it with a wide range of inputs.
*   The vulnerability was specifically discovered in the JPEG2000 (JP2K) parser (JP2KLib.dll) within Adobe Reader.
*   The Check Point researchers reverse-engineered the JP2K library to create a harness for the fuzzer.
*   They found several other vulnerabilities (53 total) in Adobe Reader and Adobe Pro using the same methodology.
*   The researchers used WinAFL, a Windows port of the AFL fuzzer, to find these vulnerabilities.
*   The research underscores that even well-known software can have many undiscovered vulnerabilities and that fuzzing can be an effective method for finding such issues.
