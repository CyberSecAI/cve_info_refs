Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `ccNewsletter` component for Joomla. Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the `removeSubscriber` task, which is triggered by the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the database. The PoC provided shows that the attacker can retrieve database information (like version and database name).
*   **Potential full system compromise:** Depending on the database user's permissions, the attacker could potentially gain control over the entire database server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file.
*   **`id` parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Joomla installation.
*   **No authentication required**: The exploit does not seem to require prior authentication, making it easy to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Exploit-DB entry includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, providing the exact URL path and malicious SQL payload to inject.
*   The Joomla Extensions Directory lists `ccNewsletter` as unpublished with the reason being "PE1: PE1", which is likely related to the vulnerability being present in the extension.
*   The vulnerable version is specified as `2.x Stable`
