Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the wpglobus WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several configuration options before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.
*   **CSRF:** The plugin does not implement proper CSRF protection (like nonce validation) on the options update functionality. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions via a malicious crafted request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize input in the following parameters:
    *   `wpglobus_option[enabled_languages][en]` (and similar for other languages)
    *   `wpglobus_option[more_languages]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[selector_wp_list_pages][show_selector]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[post_type][post]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[post_type][page]`
    *   `wpglobus_option[browser_redirect][redirect_by_language]`
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin does not use nonce to validate requests, allowing CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies, potentially gaining administrator access.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify content on the WordPress site.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the administrator.
*   **CSRF:** A successful CSRF attack allows an attacker to:
    *   Modify plugin settings, including injecting the XSS payloads.
    *   Potentially compromise the entire website by gaining admin access if combined with the XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious code into the vulnerable plugin options via the WordPress admin interface. This can be done by an attacker who has already gained access to the WordPress admin panel or, using the CSRF vulnerability below, by tricking an admin into submitting a malicious form.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that contains a form that submits a request to the vulnerable options update endpoint. A logged-in administrator visiting this page will unknowingly submit the form, allowing the attacker to modify the plugin options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** To directly inject the XSS payload, the attacker would need administrator level access to the WordPress admin panel. Alternatively they can use the CSRF attack vector.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs the ability to host an HTML page and lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit the page. They do not necessarily require direct access to the WordPress site itself.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes specific payload examples for exploiting both the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities.  It also notes that the vulnerability was tested in WordPress 4.9.1 and the latest version of the wpglobus plugin at the time of the report.

This analysis provides more details than a typical CVE description, including specific vulnerable parameters, example payloads, and the combination of the CSRF and XSS issues.
