  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `s_order` and `s_row` parameters within the `site_search.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the application",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `site_search.php`, by manipulating the `s_order` and `s_row` parameters with crafted SQL payloads.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and manipulate the GET parameters."
