{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The WordPress plugin 'responsive-coming-soon-page' does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when saving plugin settings, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities. Additionally, the plugin lacks CSRF protection, allowing attackers to trick administrators into performing actions they did not intend.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored XSS vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "CSRF vulnerability due to missing CSRF protection."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser. Combined with the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can trick an administrator into unknowingly performing actions on the WordPress site, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft malicious input containing JavaScript payloads within the plugin's settings page. By tricking an administrator into submitting the malicious form via a CSRF attack, the attacker can trigger the stored XSS when the admin views the affected settings page or views content that displays the stored data. The attack requires the victim to be an authenticated user.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious HTML page to exploit the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker also needs to lure a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to visit the malicious HTML page and submit the malicious form."
