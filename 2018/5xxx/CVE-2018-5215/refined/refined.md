Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5215

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the Fork CMS application when handling the "title" parameter in the page editing functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The application doesn't adequately sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the "title" parameter before saving it to the database, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page.
*   **Account Takeover:** This could lead to session hijacking or stealing of credentials, leading to complete account takeover.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect to malicious websites or distribute malware.
*   **Defacement:**  Altering the displayed content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by using the vulnerable title parameter in the edit pages section of Fork CMS.
*   **Admin Access Required:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or have sufficient privileges to edit pages within the Fork CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have valid administrative privileges to access the "Pages" edit functionality of the Fork CMS.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to navigate to the page editing section and use the title parameter to insert the malicious code.
