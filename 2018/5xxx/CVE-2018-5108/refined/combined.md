## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/printing/ipc/RemotePrintJobParent.cpp?q=RemotePrintJobParent%3A%3APrintPage&redirect_type=single#100-127>
Is the relevant code, it accepts a path from the content process and then opens it up. On macOS at least, the content process can write a symlink into that directory, causing it to open an arbitrary file on disk.
It looks like the expected format of the the file is a custom binary format, so this probably can't be used to leak the full contents of arbitrary files, but it needs closer inspection: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/printing/PrintTranslator.cpp?q=%2Bfunction%3A%22mozilla%3A%3Alayout%3A%3APrintTranslator%3A%3ATranslateRecording%28std%3A%3Aistream+%26%29%22&redirect_type=single#28>
Unfortunately I haven't found a way to use the macOS sandboxing policy language to disallow creating symlinks. I'm going to file a bug with apple requesting it. Therefore any place the chrome process opens up paths in the content process's temporary directory, it needs to validate that they aren't symlinks -- my understanding (correct if wrong!) is that printing is the only place we do this. (I wonder if we should instead generate a pipe-pair and send the content process the write end, to avoid needing to read from this path on disk in chrome).
(I put this bug in sandboxing, but maybe it belongs in printing?) I believe this should be sec-low or sec-moderate (it only really affects nightly because the sandbox doesn't prevent filesystem access directly on other release channels!)

It also looks like passing a non-existant file path will cause |PrintTranslator::TranslateRecording| to read uninitialized memory.

Yes opening the files in the parent and passing down the handle, was something I wanted to look into here.
I think on Windows symlinks can only be created by Administrator.
I guess using a pipe essentially does the same thing?
Would there be size limitations here though?

I agree that it would be good to check that the file exists (along with the symlink check for MacOS and linux, although doesn't hurt on Windows as well). Better still to pass down some Handle/FD from the parent, if not too difficult.
However, I think if the file doesn't exist the ifstream will just fail to open and subsequent reads will fail.
This does mean that magicInt will remain uninitialised, but it would then almost certainly fail the following check.
If not there in the next checks or the call to good().
We could initialize it anyway, to make sure, given ReadElement doesn't indicate failure (not quite sure why that is).
When you say "read uninitialised memory" do you mean this uint32\_t (magicInt)?

How could this leak the contents of files, wouldn't that need the parent process to pass something back to the child for it to read?
The main risk here is an attack on the parent process I think, but the child can already write whatever it wants into this file.
This is all somewhat mitigated by the fact that you have to convince someone to print first before the attack.

It's the only case that I know for sure, I think we might write to it for some crash reporting data.
I know we create temporary files for media (for the cache I think) and blobs, but they are created in the parent [1].
We might be able to use this for printing or at least some of the code for a parent driven version of it.
One complication is that I'm not sure how easy it is to create an ofstream from an FD.
Although it looks like there have been some changes to further abstract the stream required for the recording.

Thanks for looking at this code by the way. :-)
It's definitely an area for concern as a possible route for exploits, so it's great to get more eyes on it.

Yes, when I said "read initialized memory", I was talking about |magicInt|, I don't know how seriously we consider uninitialized-stack-reads.
As for how it could leak the contents of the files, I don't \_think\_ it can. If the results were put in some file readable by content, that'd be a problem (for files properly formatted in this graphs serialization file, heh). I suppose if you physically printed the symlinked-to-file that'd be an interesting attack :-)
Agreed that the best way to resolve is to switch to passing around a handle/fd instead a filename. (Do we have a document anywhere that lists all the places that use content temp?)
a) Is there someone from a printing/gfx team we should add to this bug?
b) Is there good prior art to look at for passing the handle/fd to the child?

Not that I am aware of.

Maybe jwatt (added) at least so he's aware, as he's been dealing with a fair amount of printing stuff.

That code I mentioned does it, if you look at AnonymousTemporaryFileRequestor.
I think haik might also have done something similar for the webext change, but he might have used existing functionality.
Getting the handle might be the easy part, we probably need to think about how we use it in the child first before we go too far down that road.

For the moz-extension remoting, there are two ways the file access is remoted. One uses AutoIPCStream and the other sends a bare FD to the child.
When the child is requesting a single non-JAR file from the parent, we use an AutoIPCStream. ExtensionProtocolHandler::NewStream() returns a FileInputStream to NeckoParent::RecvGetExtensionStream() and the Necko code creates an AutoIPCStream to send to the child. The child can then read from the input stream it receives. The AutoIPCStream implementation actually passes the FD to the child so data is \_not\_ streamed over IPC. See the comments on AutoIPCStream: <http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/5dadcbe55b4ddd1e448c06c77390ff6483aa009b/ipc/glue/IPCStreamUtils.h#123> This seems like a good possibility.
The other way is when the child is requesting a JAR file FD from the parent, we use the FileDescriptor IPDL type in a new Necko IPDL message which handles IPC serialization and "just works". In ExtensionProtocolHandler::NewFD(), the parent opens an existing file and gets its FD to send to the child. The child then creates an nsIFile using the received FD (which is slightly ugly because the nsIFile implementation FileDescriptorFile doesn't support all the nsIFile methods.)
:baku has done a lot of work to make this streamlined and might have a better recommendation.

The symlink part of this is addressed by 1379803 - assuming that Windows and Linux are also able to lock out symlinks.

Even with 1379803, I think it would be good for the parent to make sure it's not getting a symlink (assuming we don't change the code to use FD's only) providing some defense in depth.

On Linux this might also apply to hard links, but I don't think we need to allow link() at all — the only thing we saw using it was an input method plugin, and we stopped loading those in content processes because they don't directly handle input events.

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

STR:
1. in a normal tab, open a page with this code:
var b = new Blob(["<script>var a = new BroadcastChannel('b'); a.onmessage = e => { alert(e.data); }</" + "script>"], { type: 'text/html' });
var u = URL.createObjectURL(b);
console.log(u);
2. open a private browsing window with the blobURL shown in the web console.
3. in the web console for the normal tab do:
var a = new BroadcastChannel('b');
a.postMessage(42);
Expected result:
First of all, a blob URL generated on a normal tab should not be accessible from a private browsing tab. Additionally, it should not be able to receive messages from the normal tab.
Note that this is not a bug in BroadcastChannel, but it's related on how we treat blob URLs.
This test works on any OriginAttributes segregation: containers, first party isolation and so on.
We should probably revisit the idea of keeping the principal together with a blob URL, via nsIURIWthPrincipal.

blobUrl\_subsumes.patch
Doesn't this break sensing blob urls across cross-domain windows and loading urls in non-original window?
Please test, and perhaps test also some other browser too.
But I assume that just works atm.

This bug should me marked as sec-moderate. Patch landing because this issue can be reproduced only if the user users a blobURL as top-level URL manually.

This patch breaks a feature in Firefox Screenshots: screenshots can no longer be downloaded in 'never remember history' mode[1].
The Screenshots implementation involves generating a blob from a canvas in content[2], sending the blob to the webextension background page[3], then triggering a download from the background page[4]. This patch (deliberately) breaks the messaging step.
Is there any way we could restore the Screenshots download feature when history is disabled?
We'd ideally like to get this bug fixed and uplifted to 58 this week.

Can you only message strings? And it's too expensive to just message the data: URL?

Elaborating on Anne's comment, I presume the problem is that <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/713f2e3fbeefcaaecba634515184d00029c69d89/addon/webextension/blobConverters.js#L11> does new Blob() in a content script, and the Blob is coming from the content window global.
I think we want to add "Blob" and "File" to the wantGlobalProperties of the extension content script's sandbox at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/2e08acdf8862e68b13166970e17809a3b5d6a555/toolkit/components/extensions/ExtensionContent.jsm#451> but this probably also wants webextensions to add a bunch more tests.

If you can message the actual Blob object and only create a URL from it at the point of download, there should be no problem. Blob objects by themselves don't carry an origin (principal if you will), those only get associated with blob: URLs.

|  | |

Ah, whoops, right.
Then the mis-match here probably is the situation where "Never Remember History" is really "always use private browsing mode" which means that the extension's background page principal will end up having an mPrivateBrowsingId > 0 but the download is using the system principal[1] and the system principal has mPrivateBrowsingId == 0. And so the new error case will fire because IsOriginAttributesEqualIgnoringFPD will fail because it doesn't special case for the system principal.
Or at least I think we haven't fixed the extension background page private browsing id issue...

Yes, thanks for the responses. I'll experiment with actually creating the URL inside the background window.

As I read <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/58c82fb9fa151f7db4a094fe9bd5eb85741a7acd/addon/webextension/background/main.js#L227>, you're already doing that and this is a function of the originattributes for the background window having an mPrivateBrowsingId > 0.

What type of download are you referring to? Normal file downloads are handled by the nsExternalHelperAppService[1] creating a DownloadLegacyTransfer[2] by way of it implementing nsITransfer[3]. In that case the channel is already opened by the uriloader which "diverts" the channel to the external helper app stuff in the parent. Compare with the screenshot extension which uses the Downloads.jsm API via the webext downloads API to explicitly trigger a download which I believe uses the DownloadCopySaver[4] which takes on the responsibility of opening the channel and decides to do it with the system principal, rather than the relevant docshell (which would inherently be associated with the principal that minted the URL via createObjectUrl).

As I understand it, this is already happening and most of our problem[1]. Unless it's been corrected, I believe the webextensions' background windows end up with private browsing flags set on their docshell. Okay, and yeah, I just ran a nightly build under linux with "never remember history" and attached gdb and it agrees with me[1]. Also if I set a breakpoint at <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b2e989b32e54#l1.58> we see it's a private browsing flag mismatch[2]

And to propose a short-term fix, we probably want to avoid the originattributes equality check if the aLoadInfo's principal is the system principal. I'll quickly create a patch and test it and ask baku to review/handle from there.

(fixing assignee... I keep forgetting bzexport does that and it doesn't honor my .hgrc)
We should probably add an explicit test that covers the downloads API, possibly as exposed by the webextensions API, downloading a blob url minted in an origin that will not match up with the system principal. This would likely take the form of a test where we use a content page that's in a container or private browsing mode, have it perform a createObjectUrl, and have the webextension pass that URL to the downloads API. Unless we think the webextensions API should explicitly forbid that use-case.Assignee: bugmail → amarchesini

I'd say it's generally cleaner to pass around objects. Especially since if you pass on a string you don't know when to revoke it (basically manual memory management).

System principal does not need to match originAttributes
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]:
This bug, the patch already uplifted to beta.
[User impact if declined]:
The webext Downloads API will fail to download URLs created via createObjectURL() that originate in a page context whose originattributes aren't the same as those used by the system principal. This means private browsing pages and user container pages. Because of weird fallout from the "always use private browsing"/"never remember history" preference surfaced in our preferences UI, the built-in Firefox Screenshots extension thing breaks when that is enabled. It's also likely other webexts can break even without that preference enabled if they are using createObjectURL from within a content script.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]:
Not for this specific edge case, but we have test coverage that ensures the world won't break.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]:
By me, locally.
The fix has been in nightly since the 20171207220423 build.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]:
This was found by QE in <https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3886> and probably wants QE to re-verify. I'm going to comment on that issue again to ask for a verification.
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]:
No.
[Is the change risky?]:
No.
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]:
It's just a system principal check and the check explicitly handles edge-cases to a null principal being provided.
[String changes made/needed]:
None.

For clarity, I believe a data URL is being passed around, if we're talking about this code path:
<https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/41e27fd2567743f7067fd3d3649df8203f05f978/addon/webextension/selector/shooter.js#L194>
And here's where it goes from data URL to Blob and then Blob URL that gets downloaded:
<https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/blob/58c82fb9fa151f7db4a094fe9bd5eb85741a7acd/addon/webextension/background/main.js#L226,L241>
aside: I was confused about this previously and thought the Blob was being directly passed because I confused the "takeShot" code path, which does send a Blob, with the "downloadShot" path, which does not, and is the actual thing we're talking about.
Double-aside: The use of data URLs instead of blobs is understandable given that IndexedDB is inoperable for webexts for the "never remember history" snafu we're dealing with here. But it is sad, Blobs rock! :)

System principal does not need to match originAttributes
might have been cleaner to do the followup in a separate bug, but let's get this new patch in beta so things are consistent.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))
