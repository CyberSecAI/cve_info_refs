Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition that occurs when form input elements, their focus, and selections are manipulated by JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: The core issue is that a form input element, or a related object, is accessed after it has already been freed from memory, leading to memory corruption and a crash.
- Improper handling of script manipulation: The browser fails to properly manage the lifecycle of form input elements when they are actively manipulated by JavaScript. Specifically, when focus and selections are involved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potentially exploitable crash: Successful exploitation can lead to a crash of the application.
- Arbitrary code execution: The provided content suggests that, because the use-after-free occurs in an area of memory related to browser objects, the crash could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, though this is not guaranteed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious website: The attacker needs to entice the user into opening a specially crafted web page.
- JavaScript manipulation: The malicious web page employs JavaScript to manipulate form input elements, their focus, and selections in a way that triggers the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and host malicious website or embed the malicious code into a web application or website with an injection vulnerability
- Ability to entice the user to visit the crafted web page

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when form elements, focus, and selections are manipulated by script content
- The use-after-free condition results in a crash of the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Red Hat bugzilla entry, and mentions the vulnerability is resolved in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 6 via RHSA-2018:0122 and RHSA-2018:0262.
- Mozilla explicitly mentions in the security advisory that "these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts."
- A similar bug report (Bug 1399400) is included, showing a simplified test case
