{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization/validation when saving/displaying data in the 'Extras', 'Themes', and 'Forms' sections of the WordPress Booking Calendar plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the 'Extras', 'Themes', and 'Forms' settings pages of the WordPress Booking Calendar plugin.",
    "Lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the browsers of other users, including administrators, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via form input fields in the 'Extras', 'Themes', or 'Forms' sections. This injected code is then stored and executed when other users view or edit these sections. The CSRF vulnerability can be leveraged to force administrators to make unintended changes to the pluginâ€™s settings. An attacker could use a malicious crafted HTML page hosted on their own server to trigger the CSRF vulnerability by tricking an administrator into loading the page in their browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to edit settings in the plugin. This can be achieved through either a low-privilege user role or by tricking a higher-privilege user into visiting a malicious web page that exploits the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker can also exploit the Stored-XSS vulnerabilities if they have low level access to plugin configuration page."
