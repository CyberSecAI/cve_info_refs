Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote sql-injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Zenario v7.1 - v7.6 content management system web-application.
The sql-injection web vulnerability allows remote attackers with restricted account to execute own malicious sql commands to compromise
the web-application and database management system.
The sql-injection vulnerability is location in the `Name` input field of the `Categories - Edit` module create POST method request.
Remote attackers with restricted privileged accounts are able to execute own malicious sql commands to compromise the application.
The attack vector of the vulnerability occurs on the client-side and the request method to inject is POST.
The security risk of the sql-injection vulnerability is estimated as high with a common vulnerability scoring system count of 7.0.
Exploitation of the sql-injection web vulnerability requires a restricted site admin user account without user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the sql-injection vulnerability results in web-application or database management system compromise.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Categories - Edit
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] organizer.php
[+] admin\_boxes.ajax.php

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Escape the content and the parameter of the current\_value
2. Disallow the usage of special chars
3. Restrict the size of the input to prevent further exploitation
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the remote sql-injection web vulnerability in the web-application is estimated as medium
because of the site\_admin account access is required. (CVSS 5.9)
