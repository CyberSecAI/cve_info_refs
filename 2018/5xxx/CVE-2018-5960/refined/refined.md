  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Name` field of the `Categories - Edit` module when creating or editing a category.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection. The application fails to sanitize the 'Name' parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of the web application and the database management system. Attackers could potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or take control of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, requiring a POST request to the `admin_boxes.ajax.php` endpoint with a crafted payload within the `Name` field of the Categories - Edit module.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a restricted administrator account on the Zenario CMS application. No user interaction is required."
