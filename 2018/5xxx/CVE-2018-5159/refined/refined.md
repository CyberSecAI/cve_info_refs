  "CVE-2018-5159": {
    "Description": "An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in Skia's SkTDArray due to lack of overflow checks when allocating memory for an array. Specifically, the `fReserve` and `fCount` variables are 32-bit integers and the calculation `fReserve * sizeof(T)` or `sizeof(T) * count` could lead to an integer overflow on 32 bit systems.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An out-of-bounds write can occur when appending an element to a `SkTDArray` whose memory allocation size calculation resulted in an integer overflow, leading to a crash. It can be triggered by malicious web content.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious web content",
      "Crafted PDF file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to entice a user to load a malicious web page or open a malicious PDF file. The vulnerability is triggered when rendering dashed paths in the Skia library and can be reached through HTML Canvas API, Javascript, SVG, and PDF rendering.",
      "Additional Details": "The `baseURI` property can be manipulated to install themes without user interaction which can contain malicious content. This vulnerability is located in the Skia library, specifically `SkTDArray`. Skia uses 32-bit integers to store array length and capacity, failing to check for integer overflows when allocating memory, leading to out of bounds write conditions. The vulnerability is present in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, but also potentially affects other software that uses the Skia graphics library."
