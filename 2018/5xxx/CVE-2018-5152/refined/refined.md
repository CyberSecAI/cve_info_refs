Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5152:

**1. Verification:**
The content from `usn.ubuntu.com` and `bugzilla.mozilla.org` directly references CVE-2018-5152, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how WebExtensions handle permissions and the `webRequest` API, specifically in relation to Mozilla-owned websites like `accounts.firefox.com`.
- WebExtensions with sufficient permissions could use the `webRequest` API to intercept network traffic and inject content scripts into these Mozilla sites, effectively bypassing the intended same-origin policy restrictions and potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Same-Origin Bypass:** WebExtensions could circumvent same-origin policy by attaching content scripts and using the `webRequest` API on privileged Mozilla sites.
- **Information Leak:** The `webRequest` API could be used to eavesdrop on sensitive network traffic, including login credentials for Firefox Accounts.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker can intercept and manipulate data in transit, they could potentially compromise user accounts and the data associated with them in the sync backend.
-  The bug report also discussed that malicious extensions could potentially modify the list of synced addons, causing other web extensions to be installed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker could intercept usernames and (encrypted) passwords.
- **Account Compromise:**  By gaining access to account credentials, attackers could modify synced data such as history, bookmarks, and even installed extensions.
- **Potential for wider impact:** Modification of extensions through the sync backend could introduce malicious extensions, thus impacting the user beyond the immediate account.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious or compromised WebExtensions with the necessary permissions to access specified sites.
- The attacker requires the user to install a malicious extension.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Extension:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious WebExtension or compromise a legitimate one.
- **Appropriate Permissions:** The malicious extension must request the necessary permissions, like `webRequest` and host access permissions for the target Mozilla website (e.g., `accounts.firefox.com` or `<all_urls>`).
- **User Interaction:** The user has to install the malicious extension.

**Additional Details from the Bugzilla Content**
- The vulnerability was initially classified as a security-high bug but was later downgraded to moderate severity
- The fix involved introducing a preference that maintains a list of restricted domains for which WebExtensions have limited access
- The fix was implemented by adding checks on both the URL of the request as well as the URL of the document that triggered the request.
-  The fix involved restricting content script injection,  `webRequest` events, and usage of the Devtools API on specified sites.
-  The fix was included in Firefox 60.
