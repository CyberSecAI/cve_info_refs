Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is within the LibRaw library's handling of image files. The specific flaw is not detailed in the provided text, but it is part of a series of vulnerabilities related to incorrect handling of photo files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability in libraw allows for a crash, denial of service, or possibly arbitrary code execution. This suggests memory corruption vulnerabilities may be at play, such as out-of-bounds reads/writes or other memory safety issues. Specific vulnerability types are mentioned in a related advisory as: divisions by zero, out-of-bounds read memory access, heap-based buffer overflows and NULL pointer dereferences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: A successful attack can cause applications that use LibRaw to crash, making them unavailable.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:  The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to execute malicious code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted photo file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted photo file to a system running an application that uses the vulnerable libraw library. No specific user interaction beyond opening a file is specified.
