Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-5380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd)'s handling of internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables used for debugging. Specifically, the code does not properly handle conversion tables, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The bgpd daemon can read past the allocated buffer when converting BGP codes to strings, which causes an internal table overrun by 1 pointer value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is the ability to insert binary data into the internal log files.
- The vulnerability may lead to denial of service due to the crash and/or exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious BGP code-point. An attacker needs to send crafted BGP messages with specific code-points to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a configured and trusted BGP peer.
- The attacker does not need any special system privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of Quagga BGP daemon prior to 1.2.4.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious BGP code point.
- At the time of the advisory publication, no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.
- CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 4.3
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
- The vulnerability is addressed in Quagga version 1.2.4 and later.
