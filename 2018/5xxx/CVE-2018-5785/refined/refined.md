Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5785:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when handling certain BMP files within the OpenJPEG library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code attempts to perform a left bit shift operation using an exponent that is too large for the integer type, leading to an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition. This likely occurs due to the program crashing or entering an unrecoverable state caused by the overflow. It could also involve excessive resource usage that makes the service unusable.
*   **Possible Remote Code Execution:** While the primary impact is DoS, some sources suggest that remote code execution could be possible. This is mentioned in the Ubuntu Security Notice.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted BMP File:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted BMP file to the vulnerable software. This file would be specifically designed to cause the integer overflow when processed by OpenJPEG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or cause the vulnerable software to process the malicious BMP file. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   Sending the malicious file via email or other file transfer mechanism.
    *   Uploading the malicious file to a website that uses the vulnerable library.
    *   Directly interacting with software that utilizes the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects the `openjpeg2` library.
*   **Versions:** The issue was resolved in the `2.1.2-1.1+deb9u3` version for Debian stretch and `2.3.0-2build0.18.04.1` for Ubuntu 18.04.
*   **Reproducibility:** The issue can be reproduced using the `opj_compress` tool from the OpenJPEG library with a crafted BMP file.
*   **Detection:** The issue was detected using UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer).
*   **Mitigation:** Users are advised to update their `openjpeg2` packages to the fixed versions provided by their respective distributions.

**Summary**

CVE-2018-5785 in OpenJPEG is caused by an integer overflow when processing crafted BMP files which can be exploited for denial of service. There is a suggestion in one source that remote code execution is a possibility, although this is not in the other sources. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious BMP file to software using vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
