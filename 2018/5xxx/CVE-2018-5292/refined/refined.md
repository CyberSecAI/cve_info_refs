The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the "gd-rating-system" WordPress plugin. The vulnerabilities include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**XSS Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `panel` parameter in the admin pages of the plugin is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
*  **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests to specific admin pages with a malicious payload in the `panel` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the admin pages, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking of admin users
    *   Defacement of the admin panel
    *   Execution of malicious actions on behalf of the admin user

**LFI Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `panel` parameter in the admin pages of the plugin allows for arbitrary file inclusion due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. The plugin uses the parameter to construct file paths for inclusion using the `include` function, without properly validating the parameter.
*   **Weakness:**  Insecure use of the `include` function with user-controlled input.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests to specific admin pages with a crafted path in the `panel` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be logged in as an admin to exploit this vulnerability
*   **Impact:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the webserver, leading to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., configuration files, source code)
    *   Remote code execution if an attacker can upload a malicious file.
    *   Denial of service

**Vulnerable files:**

*   `/forms/information.php`
*   `/forms/about.php`
*   `/forms/transfer.php`
*   `/forms/tools.php`

**Specific vulnerable code:**
```php
include(GDRTS_PATH.'forms/panels/'.$_panel.'.php');
```
**Affected plugin version:**
The content states the bugs were tested in the latest version of the `gd-rating-system` plugin.
