Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5114:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2018-5114** based on the alias tag "CVE-2018-5114" in the bug report.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox handles cookies, particularly when a non-HttpOnly cookie is overwritten by an HttpOnly cookie.  Due to a regression introduced in Firefox 57, the original non-HttpOnly cookie remains accessible to JavaScript, even after the server sends a `Set-Cookie` header to update it to an HttpOnly cookie. This is because Firefox was not correctly updating the child process that handles Javascript access to cookies, while correctly setting it in the parent process for network requests.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Cookie Handling:** The core vulnerability is the inconsistency between the parent process (handling network requests) and the child process (handling JavaScript cookie access) when updating a cookie's HttpOnly attribute.
*  **Bypass of HttpOnly Protection:** The HttpOnly flag is intended to prevent JavaScript from accessing a cookie, mitigating XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This vulnerability allows JavaScript to access the cookie, effectively bypassing the HttpOnly protection.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Exploitation:** This vulnerability could be exploited through XSS attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a web page. This script can then access and steal cookies, even if those cookies are supposed to be protected by the HttpOnly flag.
*  **Session Hijacking:** Stolen cookies could allow an attacker to impersonate a user and gain access to their accounts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website/XSS:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious website or by exploiting an XSS vulnerability on a legitimate site. The attacker uses a website with malicious javascript.
*   **Cookie Overwrite:** The attacker needs to make the browser set a non-HttpOnly cookie, then overwrite it with the same cookie with the HttpOnly flag.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject JavaScript:** An attacker needs the ability to inject JavaScript into a webpage the victim visits, either through a malicious website they control or by exploiting an existing XSS flaw in a legitimate site.
*   **Control over HTTP Response:** The attacker either needs to have control over the server to set cookies, or they need the user to visit an affected page where they can manipulate the cookie responses.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a regression introduced in Firefox 57 and is caused by the fix in bug 1331680.
*   The issue only occurs in multiprocess mode of Firefox.
*   The fix involves modifying the rejection logic for HttpOnly cookies within `CookieServiceChild` to ensure that Javascript is blocked from accessing it.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 58.
*   The bug report indicates that the initial, non-HttpOnly cookie is not visible in the devtools storage panel, meaning that the user won't see the discrepancy using the standard debugging tools.

In summary, CVE-2018-5114 is a moderate security vulnerability in Firefox where the HttpOnly flag is not properly enforced when a cookie is updated. This allows an attacker to potentially gain access to cookies via Javascript, even when the cookies should have been protected, enabling session hijacking or other malicious activity.
