User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Unpack attached PoC addon
2. Go to about:debugging and temporarily load the unpacked addon
3. 'about:addons' is opened in new window
Actual results:
browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow does not check whether the passed URL is http/s only. We can open privileged about: pages as well as file: urls.
Expected results:
It should only open http/s (maybe other) URI schemes.

FYI I'm not certain this is any real security concern here. Extensions should get no more access to eg. about:addons opened this way than they would if a user opened a tab to it. Nonetheless, it is fixed.

This bug alone is not that dangerous, like the only security issue I can think of is opening 'about:addons' as soon as a user drags a link pointing to an addon and then once its dropped it will attempt to install.
Another example is that I found an xss in one of the about: pages which alone is not exploitable due to having the victim type the url manually to open the effected about: page. But coupled with this bug the whole process is automated resulting in a sec-highISH security exploit.
So technically this bug is a sec-moderate issue ( <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-21/#﷒0>﷓ )

The above URL should have a hash pointing to "[CVE-2017-7816](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7816): WebExtensions can load about: URLs in extension UI" Not sure why it did that.

* [Bug 1379276](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379276)

#### [#CVE-2018-5108: Manually entered blob URL can be accessed by subsequent private browsing tabs](#CVE-2018-5108)

Reporter
Andrea Marchesini
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

Reporter
Mario Gomes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When the text of a specially formatted URL is dragged to the addressbar from page content, the displayed URL can be spoofed to show a different site than the one loaded. This allows for phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another site.

##### References

* [Bug 1321619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1321619)

#### [#CVE-2018-5112: Extension development tools panel can open a non-relative URL in the panel](#CVE-2018-5112)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Development Tools panels of an extension are required to load URLs for the panels as relative URLs from the extension manifest file but this requirement was not enforced in all instances. This could allow the development tools panel for the extension to load a URL that it should not be able to access, including potentially privileged pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1425224](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425224)

#### [#CVE-2018-5113: WebExtensions can load non-HTTPS pages with browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow](#CVE-2018-5113)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow` function of WebExtensions is only allowed to load content over `https:` but this requirement was not properly enforced. This can potentially allow privileged pages to be loaded by the extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1425267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425267)

#### [#CVE-2018-5114: The old value of a cookie changed to HttpOnly remains accessible to scripts](#CVE-2018-5114)

Reporter
Inko
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an existing cookie is changed to be `HttpOnly` while a document is open, the original value remains accessible through script until that document is closed. Network requests correctly use the changed HttpOnly cookie.

##### References

* [Bug 1421324](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324)

#### [#CVE-2018-5115: Background network requests can open HTTP authentication in unrelated foreground tabs](#CVE-2018-5115)

Reporter
Jerry Decime
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an HTTP authentication prompt is triggered by a background network request from a page or extension, it is displayed over the currently loaded foreground page. Although the prompt contains the real domain making the request, this can result in user confusion about the originating site of the authentication request and may cause users to mistakenly send private credential information to a third party site.

##### References

* [Bug 1409449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409449)

#### [#CVE-2018-5116: WebExtension ActiveTab permission allows cross-origin frame content access](#CVE-2018-5116)

Reporter
Ronen Zilberman
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions with the `ActiveTab` permission are able to access frames hosted within the active tab even if the frames are cross-origin. Malicious extensions can inject frames from arbitrary origins into the loaded page and then interact with them, bypassing same-origin user expectations with this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1396399](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1396399)

#### [#CVE-2018-5117: URL spoofing with right-to-left text aligned left-to-right](#CVE-2018-5117)

Reporter
xisigr of Tencent's Xuanwu Lab
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If right-to-left text is used in the addressbar with left-to-right alignment, it is possible in some circumstances to scroll this text to spoof the displayed URL. This issue could result in the wrong URL being displayed as a location, which can mislead users to believe they are on a different site than the one loaded.

##### References

* [Bug 1395508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395508)

#### [#CVE-2018-5118: Activity Stream images can attempt to load local content through file:](#CVE-2018-5118)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The screenshot images displayed in the Activity Stream page displayed when a new tab is opened is created from the meta tags of websites. An issue was discovered where the page could attempt to create these images through `file:` URLs from the local file system. This loading is blocked by the sandbox but could expose local data if combined with another attack that escapes sandbox protections.

##### References

* [Bug 1420049](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420049)

#### [#CVE-2018-5119: Reader view will load cross-origin content in violation of CORS headers](#CVE-2018-5119)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

The reader view will display cross-origin content when CORS headers are set to prohibit the loading of cross-origin content by a site. This could allow access to content that should be restricted in reader view.

##### References

* [Bug 1420507](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420507)

#### [#CVE-2018-5121: OS X Tibetan characters render incompletely in the addressbar](#CVE-2018-5121)

Reporter
Khalil Zhani
Impact
low
##### Description

Low descenders on some Tibetan characters in several fonts on OS X are clipped when rendered in the addressbar. When used as part of an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) this can be used for domain name spoofing attacks.
*Note: This attack only affects OS X operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

You've probably noticed that BMO has a lot going on. We'll now delve into some more details of various definitions, features, and processes in BMO.

For people working on Firefox, please see [the Bug Handling section in the in-tree documentation for information on how to triage and make decisions on bugs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/index.html).

Finally, this is a work in progress (and may always be, since BMO is improving all the time). There are many stubs (indicated by italics).

# Creating a Bugzilla Account

To fully use all of the features of bugzilla.mozilla.org and most importantly, to file a new bug you will need to create an account. Currently there are two ways to do this.

## Create a Local Account

From the homepage, click "new account," which will let you create an account directly. You will need a valid email address. An email will be sent that will provide a special link you can follow to finish the account creation process. You will be able to enter your own private password.

## Log in With GitHub

If you have a GitHub account you can use it to log in and create an account.

* First click "Log in".
* Then click the Octocat/GitHub logo.
* If you are signed into GitHub you'll be asked if you want GitHub to login to bugzilla.mozilla.org on your behalf and what information about your account will be shared from GitHub with us.
* If you aren't signed in, GitHub will ask you to login, then if you want to be asked if you want GitHub to be able to login on your behalf.
* You'll be identified by the email address you use on GitHub.

**Note:** If you have previously created a local account as described in the first method above, and then decide to use GitHub to login later, just make sure the email address you have registered in GitHub matches the email address used to create the local account. Otherwise, a separate account will be created which is likely not what you want.

# Searching

*Omg, so many ways to search; why do we have so many, and how do they work?*

## Quick Search

*Quick Search rocks! You should use it.*

## Advanced Search, Pronouns

*Advanced search looks hardcore, but the rewards for learning how to drive it are plentiful. Also, pronouns are amazing.*

## Other Searches (Instant, Simple, Google)

*In case you were looking for more ways to search.*

# Bugmail

*Bugmail* is the common term for automated emails from BMO. The biggest source of bugmail is changes to bugs, but BMO may also email you reports and other notices.

## Filtering

*Too much bugmail? Filter on BMO itself and/or via x-headers!*

### Filtering with GMail

GMail's ability to filter on headers is somewhat limited. We've got a separate, complete [guide](/BMO/UserGuide/Filtering_Bugzilla_Email_in_GMail "BMO/UserGuide/Filtering Bugzilla Email in GMail") on advanced bugmail filtering with GMail.

# Users

Bugzilla isn't as user-centric as many modern web apps, but we've added a few features in the last few years.

## User Profiles

By selecting [My Profile](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile) from the dropdown in BMO's header, you can see a collection of statistics about your interactions with BMO. You can use the Search field at the top to see the profile of any other BMO user. Clicking on a user's name in a bug view also provides a link to that user's profile.

There's a [project page](/BMO/UserProfiles "BMO/UserProfiles") about User Profiles which has brief description of the fields.

## "New to Bugzilla"

A user's comments will be tagged as "New to Bugzilla" under the following conditions:

* The user does *not* have editbugs access.
* The user has made 25 comments or less **OR** the account is less than 60 days old.

The "New to Bugzilla" indicator doesn't mean *this account was created recently*, it's an indicator that *this user hasn't used Bugzilla much, please tailor your responses accordingly*.

This is only displayed to people with canconfirm or editbugs access.

# Understanding, Editing, and Filing Bugs

## Standard Bug Fields

Bugzilla bugs have a lot of fields that allow for classifying types of bugs. This also allows for easy grouping and searching for specific bugs. Most of the standard bug fields are described [here](/BMO/UserGuide/BugFields "BMO/UserGuide/BugFields").

## Comment Tagging

Want to convey some out-of-band information on a comment? Tag it.
Want to auto-collapse a spammy, abusive, or obsolete comment? [Tag it](/BMO/Comment_Tagging "BMO/Comment Tagging").

## Comment Editing

Some users can edit comments made on bugs, if you do so, please follow [our guidelines](/BMO/Editing_Comments "BMO/Editing Comments").

## Keywords and the Whiteboard

*What are all these keywords and weird whiteboard stuff? What is a whiteboard anyhow? Which should i use?*

**Keywords**:
These are a limited set of keyword tags, set by teams and people with admin privilege. You can start typing a tag and get a dropdown menu of all the keywords currently available. Keywords like "regression" and "crash" are used by engineering, release, and QA teams, for example.

**Whiteboard**:
The whiteboard field is for free tagging. It's used both by teams and by people who want to track bugs they're interested in.

## Tracking Status

See [BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses](/BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses "BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses")

## Tracking Flags

[![Flagexample.png](/images/thumb/8/89/Flagexample.png/400px-Flagexample.png)](/File%3AFlagexample.png)
### tracking-firefoxXX

*Who's doing the tracking? Should i even set these flags?*

Tracking flags are used by developers, triagers, QA and the release management teams to keep track of bugs whose fixes are slated to go into a particular product release. A tracking flag shows whether a bug is being investigated for possible resolution in the Firefox XX release. Bugs marked tracking-Firefox XX are bugs that must be resolved one way or another before a particular release ships. [Release drivers](/Firefox/Drivers "Firefox/Drivers") will track and shepherd the bug until it is determined the bug no longer impacts the release.

[![Tracking-flag-example.png](/images/thumb/4/4b/Tracking-flag-example.png/300px-Tracking-flag-example.png)](/File%3ATracking-flag-example.png)

Tracking flags have the values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| --- | Default/Not nominated |
| ? | Bug is nominated for this release |
| + | Bug is tracked for this release |
| - | Bug will not be tracked for this release |
| blocking | Bug is considered a blocker for this release |

Most users will only be able to [nominate a bug for tracking](/Release_Management/Release_Process#All_about_Flags "Release Management/Release Process") by setting the tracking flag for a release to *?*. The Release Drivers group (which includes Release Management) will respond to the request for tracking.

For example, a [search for tracking Firefox Beta and "+"](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=cf_tracking_firefox_beta&o1=equals&v1=%2B) would list the bugs which release managers decided to track for the Beta release of Firefox.

If you would like to suggest a bug and its fix be considered (by release managers) for a particular release, edit the bug and set the tracking flag for that release to *?*. This is often done for a bug that's been fixed in one release channel but needs to be uplifted to another.

Refer to [these guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20160417051846/https%3A//blog.mozilla.org/channels/2011/06/01/more-details-about-how-to-use-the-tracking-firefox-bugzilla-flag/) on setting the tracking flag.

### status-firefoxXX

A flag which represents the status of the bug with respect to Firefox XX.

status-firefoxXX

| --- | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected |
| --- | --- |
| ? | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected, but we want to find out |
| unaffected | This bug does not affect Firefox XX |
| affected | This bug affects Firefox XX |
| fix-optional | This bug affects Firefox XX, we would take a fix but don't consider it as release blocking |
| fixed | This bug is fixed in Firefox XX |
| verified | This bug is fixed and verified in Firefox XX |
| disabled | This feature is disabled in Firefox XX |
| verified disabled | Disabling the feature is verified in Firefox XX |
| wontfix | A fix for this bug will not be accepted in Firefox XX |

**Approval Flags**: Set on the attachment of a bug
All patches landing on *mozilla-beta/release/esr* branches must have these nominated by setting a ***?***  flag.
Please make sure to fill in the populated list of questions **[Approval Request Comment]** that come up on the attachment.
This helps Release Management understand the user impact & the risk/reward analysis before we grant or deny approval. If this form is left incomplete it will be sent back to you for completion.

[![ApprovalRequest.png](/images/thumb/e/e7/ApprovalRequest.png/750px-ApprovalRequest.png)](/File%3AApprovalRequest.png)
## Status Flags

Status flags detail, at the release level, if a bug is present or will be addressed in a particular version.

[![Thumb](/images/6/62/Status-flag-example.png)](/File%3AStatus-flag-example.png "Thumb")

## Project Flags

Project flags are used to supplement a bug's prioritization. These flags are defined at the product and component level and will not be present for all bugs. Most often they are used to establish when a bug is to be worked on during a multi-release spanning project.

Example project flags are:

* [a11y-review](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/processes/accessibility-review.html)
* [Webcompat Priority](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/WebCompat_Priority_Flags)
* [Performance Impact](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Bugzilla#Project_Flag)

## Needinfo Flag

In some bug tracking systems, to request information from someone about a bug, the bug is usually assigned to the person asked. In Bugzilla, we use *needinfo* flags.

The *needinfo* flag can be set at or after a bug's creation. When a *needinfo* flag is set, the person asked receives an email directing them to visit the bug, logging in if necessary, and answer the question.

To create a *needinfo*, you can specify the bug's assignee (if any,) the bug's triage owner (if one is defined,) the bug's reporter, or another user. Ask the question in a comment and set the *needinfo* flag before you save the bug.

Common uses of *needinfo* include:

* Asking a bug reporter for more information so that a bug can be triaged
* Asking a subject matter expert for direction or clarification

Please respond to *needinfo* requests quickly to keep others from being blocked.

To clear a needinfo, go to the bug's page, respond to the question and save your comment. By default the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox is ticked.

If you need to route the request to another person, leave the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox ticked, and set a new *needinfo* for the person to which you want to send the question to, then save the bug.

You can see the *needinfo* flags you have requested of others and the ones requested of you in [My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html).

# Team to components mapping

All Bugzilla components are linked to a team.

The full list of teams is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams>.

The full list of components linked to a specific team is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams/TEAM_NAME> (replace TEAM\_NAME with an actual team name).

Use <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/product?type=accessible&include_fields=name&include_fields=components.name&include_fields=components.team_name> if you want to find out what team is assigned to a specific component.

When creating a new component, make sure to link it to the right team. If you are not sure, use the team the triage owner of the new component belongs to.

## Adding a new team or changing an existing one

File a bug at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration> asking to change component info.

Make sure :marco is CCed so they can adjust the quality weekly reports. Needinfo :dveditz to adjust the weekly security report

# Other Ways to use BMO and its Data

## Whining

*Bugzilla can automatically send you buglists (requires canconfirm).*

BMO can automatically send you buglists (or a group of people) at defined intervals. This requires that you have specific rights required to [create whines](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/editwhines.cgi).

## APIs

*I hear you want to integrate with BMO. Where to start, what to do next, and best practices which won't get you blocked.*

BMO has a REST API that can perform most common tasks and is great for allowing external systems to integrate with Bugzilla. More details on how to use the API can be found [here](http://bmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).

## Dashboards

*Trying to answer the "what should i do today" question? Go no further than the dashboards.*

[My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html) has some nice options for viewing lists of bugs that may be of interest to you.

# Permissions and Groups

If you would like to be able to change the status of bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW, you will need the canconfirm permission. It also allows you to file a bug as NEW rather than as UNCONFIRMED, which is the default for bugs filed by new users to bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The editbugs permission gives you the ability to edit most fields of a bug. It's very useful for adding good information to a bug, and for making summaries more clear and descriptive.

## How to apply for upgraded permissions

If you want **canconfirm**, you can add it yourself using [triage request form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=triage_request.html).

If you want **editbugs**, [file a new bug, including](https://mzl.la/2izLT4J):

* The URLs of two bugs to which you have attached patches or testcases.
* The URLs of the relevant comment on three bugs which you wanted to change, but couldn't, and so added a comment instead.

**Note:** **editbugs** implies **canconfirm** there's no need to apply for both.

There are many other groups, some team-specific, some for security reasons, and some that are for corporate confidential bugs or comments. By default, everyone is in the BMO group **everyone**. Your permissions affect which shared searches you can see. When you create a saved search of your own, you can choose to share it with any group that are in.

You can see your current [groups and permissions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=permissions).

# BMO vs Bugzilla

Bugzilla is the name of the popular issue-tracking software application, used by many organizations and maintained by the Bugzilla project. Its home is at <http://www.bugzilla.org>. While the Bugzilla project was started by Mozilla, it is administered separately, having its own Project Lead, Assistant Project Leads, and other roles. Most of the roles are, at current, occupied by Mozilla contributors, but in the past core Bugzilla contributors have not had significant involvement in other Mozilla projects. Mozilla does provide resources, including employee time, to the Bugzilla project. The best description of Mozilla's involvement in Bugzilla is that of a steward.

BMO is an abbreviation of bugzilla.mozilla.org. It is Mozilla's site-specific Bugzilla installation, which is a slight fork of the standard Bugzilla source (or "upstream") with many extensions. At the moment, the fork is technically from Bugzilla 4.2, but many features have been backported from 4.4 and master—in fact, many features in those branches were written by the BMO developers, who added them to upstream but also backported them so they could be immediately available to BMO users. Since we've backported most fixes and features that are of particular use in BMO, we haven't been strict about keeping up with the latest official upstream release. Another difference is that the BMO devs have not prioritized deployability in BMO, since fixes and features are just pushed out each week to the BMO installation, although they have made significant progress in making BMO [more hackable](/BMO/Hacking "BMO/Hacking").

In sum, the main difference between Bugzilla and BMO is that the former is the name of the general-purpose software, and the latter Mozilla's site-specific installation. An analogue is [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) versus [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
A HTTP Request is sent to the server (192.168.1.1), which responds with with a Set-Cookie (without HttpOnly flag) statement to set a cookie:
Example Response:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 287
Location: <http://192.168.1.1/webpage.php?id=1>
Connection: close
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45; path=/
<...>
The cookie PHPSESSID is set in Firefox, and the Browser follows the Location redirect to the webpage (same server 192.168.1.1) issuing the following request:
GET /webpage.php?id=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Referer: <http://192.168.1.1/login.php>
Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
This request results in the following response from the server setting a HttpOnly protected cookie (overwriting the existing one with additional HttpOnly flag):
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 303
Connection: close
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Pragma: no-cache
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45; path=/; httponly
Vary: Accept-Encoding
<...>
Summary:
=========
"Upgrading/Overwriting" a normal cookie to a httponly flagged cookie.
Actual results:
The cookie is, although now flagged with httponly, still accessible via JavaScript:
PoC 1:
Web Console:
document.cookie
"PHPSESSID=qevb2lkbjviniu2i3ie278tp45"
PoC 2:
also works via Cross-Site Scripting vector, aka:
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
-> resulting in an alert box disclosing the cookie value
Expected results:
After setting the httpOnly flag, the cookie should be protected from accessing it via JavaScript. This is a Cross-Site Scripting prevention meassure which seems to not work as intended anymore (worked as intended in earlier versions of Firefox, and works as intended in other Browsers (Chrome)).

Easy way to reproduce the issue:
Step 1:
-------
PHP script on a webserver:
<?php
setcookie("PHPSESSID", "123456", 0, "/", "", false);
//setcookie("PHPSESSID", "123456", 0, "/", "", false, true);
echo "<html><head><title></title></head>";
echo "<body><script>alert(document.cookie)</script></body></html>";
?>
Visit the PHP Script with the Firefox Browser.
Actual result:
Popup with cookie value.
Expected Result:
Popup with cookie value.
Step 2:
-------
Now comment the first setcookie line, and uncomment the second line and visit the webpage again. This line (last parameter setting HttpOnly to true) now overwrites the existing cookie with a HttpOnly protected cookie with the same name and value.
The HttpOnly flag is in fact set (can be checked by a HTTP proxy like Burp, or via a Firefox Addon like Cookie Manager).
Actual result:
Popup with cookie value.
Expected Result:
Empty Popup cause the cookie is protected by HttpOnly.

We seem to be creating \_two\_ cookies. The first, unprotected, cookie stays available to website script. The second httponly one is what we send in HTTP requests. Are we using httponly (and maybe other attributes) as a key to the cookie store?
The original non-httponly cookie is not visible in the devtools storage panel. Dev Tools seems to get the same (correct) view as network requests. Where is the bogus original cookie hiding?
This can be tested by changing the cookie value in the commented-out line of your testcase.Group: firefox-core-security → network-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → Networking: CookiesProduct: Firefox → Core

This also works fine if you disable multi-process.
Amy: could this be fall-out from [bug 1331680](/show_bug.cgi?id=1331680 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider not doing sync IPC for document.cookie getter/setter")? Just guessing that network code in the parent process updates the "real" cookies store, but because the new value is httpOnly we bail out before we sync the child process ("web content doesn't need to know about httponly cookies") and never tell it to drop the old value.Flags: needinfo?(amchung)Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

Hi Daniel,
Yes, this problem is the regression bug of [bug 1331680](/show_bug.cgi?id=1331680 "RESOLVED FIXED - Consider not doing sync IPC for document.cookie getter/setter").
I will fix this bug.

Attached patch

[implementation -- Modified rejection timing when processing httponly cookie on CookieServiceChild.](attachment.cgi?id=8933187&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8933187&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1421324&attachment=8933187)

Hi Josh,
I found we didn't consider the situation as below:
1. Server side sets a non-httponly cookie whose name is test1, and test1 will store in hashtable on CookieServiceChild.
2. Server side modifies test1 to httponly, but CookieServiceChild will reject httponly cookie on CookieServiceChild::SetCookieInternal().
3. Still can access test1 through document.cookie.
I have modified above situation as below:
1. Removed if (aCookieAttributes.isHttpOnly) {return;} from CookieServiceChild::SetCookieInternal().
2. Moved the rejection the httponly cookie setting on CookieServiceChild::RecordDocumentCookie().
Would you help me to review my patch?
Thanks!

Hi Josh,
I have finished the test case and found I have to do more modification as below:
1. CookieServiceParent has to send all of cookie-change to CookieServiceChild.
2. CookieStatus has to add isHttpOnly.

Hi Josh,
I have finished the test case, and security team suggested that us try not to create test case on security bug.
Base on this reason, I used feedback? on this test case, after f+, I will create new bug and r? this patch.
The steps of this test case:
1. Used XHR to set a cookie whose name is xhr1 and set it to non-httponly.
2. Modified xhr1 to httponly cookie.
3. This mochitest receive the notification from observer is earlier than CookieServiceParent sends the ipc msg of notifying CookieServiceChild to add/modify cookie.
base on above reason, the mochitest will confirm document.cookie can't access xhr1 after using document.cookie to set xhr2.
4. Confirmed document.cookie only accesses xhr2.
Would you help me to review this patch?

I was not able to reproduce the initial issue on old build Fx 57.0 using an Apache server and running the script following steps from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overwrite of existing cookie with HttpOnly flagged cookie results in HttpOnly being ignored by Firefox").
On both builds Fx 57.0 (that does not have this fix) and Fx 58.0 (that does have this fix) I'm getting the same result after running the script for the first time (Popup with cookie value) and for the second time after changing the comment (Popup without cookie value, empty due to HttpOnly).
Reporter, would you be comfortable verifying that the fix works for you on Firefox 58.0?

I reproduced the issue with the old (unfixed) Fx 57 (<https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/candidates/57.0-candidates/build4/win64/en-US/firefox-57.0.zip>) in multiple VMs. Maybe same issue as described in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1421324#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Overwrite of existing cookie with HttpOnly flagged cookie results in HttpOnly being ignored by Firefox") ?
Fix in 58.0 worked on my test system (Win10, x64, Fx 58.0), Popup empty.Flags: needinfo?(inko)
