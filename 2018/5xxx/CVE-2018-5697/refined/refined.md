- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `unaprove` and `order` parameters within several PHP files, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `admin_jr_admin.php`, `functions_kb.php`, and `admin_kb_art.php` files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially compromising the database management system, webserver, or the entire web application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `unaprove` and `order` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need a privileged web-application user account to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
