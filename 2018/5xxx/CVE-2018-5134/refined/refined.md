  "cveId": "CVE-2018-5134",
  "description": "WebExtensions may use `view-source:` URLs to view local `file:` URL content, as well as content stored in `about:cache`, bypassing restrictions that only allow WebExtensions to view specific content.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on how WebExtensions can use `view-source:` URLs. This allows a WebExtension to bypass the usual content restrictions and gain access to privileged content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate content security policy enforcement",
      "Improper URL handling in WebExtension APIs",
      "Lack of restrictions on view-source: URLs"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious WebExtension can use this flaw to view local file contents, as well as content from the `about:cache`. This can lead to information disclosure.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "A malicious WebExtension can open view-source: URLs for file:/// paths or about:cache through browser APIs.",
      "A malicious WebExtension can include view-source: URLs as resources in the extension's manifest."
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to create and install a malicious WebExtension to exploit this vulnerability."
