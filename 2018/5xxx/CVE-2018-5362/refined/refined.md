{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The WPGlobus plugin for WordPress fails to sanitize user-supplied input in several options, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Additionally, it lacks CSRF protection on the options update page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored XSS",
      "CSRF"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser (admin user), potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious payload within specific plugin options.",
      "The attacker creates a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by an authenticated admin user, triggers the XSS payload in the vulnerable options and also updates the vulnerable options."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to persuade an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious page controlled by the attacker or be able to convince the victim to submit the form on the attacker's page."
