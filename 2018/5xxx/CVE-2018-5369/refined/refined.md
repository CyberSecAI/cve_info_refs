{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SrbTransLatin WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize user input in the `lang_identificator` parameter when updating plugin options.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the administrator's session when they visit the plugin's settings page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick an administrator into unintentionally updating the plugin settings, injecting the malicious payload.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "Stored XSS": "By crafting a malicious value for the `lang_identificator` parameter and submitting it through the plugin's settings page. This payload is then stored in the database and executed when the settings page is loaded by an admin.",
    "CSRF": "By crafting a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable plugin's settings page, pre-filled with the malicious `lang_identificator`. When the administrator visits this page, the malicious settings update is triggered without their direct knowledge."
    },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and either trick an administrator into clicking a link (CSRF) or to have access to the vulnerable settings page to inject the XSS directly. For the CSRF, the attacker needs to host the HTML and have the admin visit it. For the stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to submit the vulnerable form."
