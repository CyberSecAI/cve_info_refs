    "summary": "Foxit Reader PDF Parsing U3D Out-of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
    "details": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of embedded U3D images inside of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.",
