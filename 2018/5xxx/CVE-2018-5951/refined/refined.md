Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2018-5951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how MikroTik RouterOS handles EoIPv6 (Ethernet over IPv6) packets. Specifically, the RouterOS implementation uses 12 reserved bits in the EtherIP header to store a tunnel ID, and swaps the first 4 and second 4 bits of the header.  The system attempts to retrieve and validate the tunnel ID by swapping bits within the EtherIP header (IP proto 97) of received packets. Crucially, it doesn't check the payload size of the received packets before performing this bit-swapping operation. This means that if a packet with a payload smaller than what's needed to extract the tunnel ID, such as a 1-byte packet is received the process fails, and the router reboots.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of payload size validation for IP proto 97 packets. RouterOS doesn't verify if the received packet has sufficient data to extract the tunnel ID.
*   **Vulnerable Packet Processing Logic:** The bit-swapping logic for EoIPv6 packets is vulnerable when processing undersized packets. It leads to a crash/reboot when the process attempts to extract the tunnel ID from an incomplete packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unauthenticated attacker can remotely trigger a device reboot, leading to service disruption. This can cause network downtime and disrupt business operations reliant on the router.
*   **System Instability:** Repeated attacks can cause frequent reboots, leading to severe network instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over a network using IPv6 packets.
*   **Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending packets using IP protocol 97 (EtherIP).
*   **Packet Size:** A small packet (e.g., 1 byte) sent to the router is enough to cause the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
*   **IPv6 Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the target router and must be on the same IPv6 network as the vulnerable router or have a route to the router.
*   **Target Requirements:** The target router must meet the following conditions:
    *   IPv6 enabled
    *   At least one tunnel interface present, although the tunnel type does not matter
    *   No firewall rules blocking input of proto 97.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit code `exploit.c` is available in the provided GitHub repository.
*   The vulnerability affects MikroTik RouterOS versions 6.39.3, 6.41, 6.42rc11, and likely other older versions with EoIPv6 support.
*   A workaround is to set up an IPv6 firewall rule to block or limit the traffic of protocol 97.  Specifically, dropping all packets with protocol=97 and packetsize<size of an ipoev6 encapsulated minimum sized ethernet frame.
*   The MikroTik team has acknowledged the issue and stated it will be fixed.
