{
  "CVE-2018-5383": {
    "description": "The Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations.",
    "root_cause": "The Bluetooth specification recommended, but did not require, that devices validate public keys during pairing using Secure Simple Pairing or LE Secure Connections features.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper validation of elliptic curve parameters during Diffie-Hellman key exchange.",
      "Missing cryptographic step, specifically public key validation, in the pairing procedure."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could use this vulnerability to expose sensitive information by intercepting and decrypting device messages or forge messages.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack during the Bluetooth pairing process.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A nearby attacker within wireless range capable of intercepting the public key exchange between two vulnerable Bluetooth devices.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects both Bluetooth low energy (LE) and BR/EDR implementations of pairing protocols. The vulnerability is in the specification itself, not the vendors implementation. The attacker needs to intercept the public key exchange by blocking transmissions, sending acknowledgements, and injecting malicious packets within a narrow time window. Both devices need to be vulnerable for a successful attack. The Bluetooth SIG has updated the specification to require public key validation and added testing to its Bluetooth Qualification Program."
