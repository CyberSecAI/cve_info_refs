## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

## Details

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when

performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11599](/security/CVE-2019-11599))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-13053](/security/CVE-2018-13053))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13093](/security/CVE-2018-13093))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted,

could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13097](/security/CVE-2018-13097),

[CVE-2018-13099](/security/CVE-2018-13099), [CVE-2018-13100](/security/CVE-2018-13100), [CVE-2018-14614](/security/CVE-2018-14614), [CVE-2018-14616](/security/CVE-2018-14616),

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

It was discovered that a use-after-free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when certain failure conditions occurred. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20856](/security/CVE-2018-20856))

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilty existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12818](/security/CVE-2019-12818))

It was discovered that the MDIO bus devices subsystem in the Linux kernel

improperly dropped a device reference in an error condition, leading to a

use-after-free. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-12819](/security/CVE-2019-12819))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Empia EM28xx DVB USB device driver

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability

when disconnecting the device. An attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-2024](/security/CVE-2019-2024))

It was discovered that the USB video device class implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control bits, resulting in an out of

bounds buffer read. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-2101](/security/CVE-2019-2101))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

It was discovered that the Appletalk IP encapsulation driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly prevent kernel addresses from being copied to user

space. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this to

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-20511](/security/CVE-2018-20511))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Validation of Elliptic Curve Parameters

Researchers at the Israel Institute of Technology identified a security vulnerability in two related *Bluetooth®*features: Secure Simple Pairing and LE Secure Connections.

The researchers identified that the Bluetooth specification recommends, but does not require, that a device supporting the Secure Simple Pairing or LE Secure Connections features validate the public key received over the air when pairing with a new device. It is possible that some vendors may have developed Bluetooth products that support those features but do not perform public key validation during the pairing procedure. In such cases, connections between those devices could be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack that would allow for the monitoring or manipulation of traffic. For an attack to be successful, an attacking device would need to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that were going through a pairing procedure. The attacking device would need to intercept the public key exchange by blocking each transmission, sending an acknowledgement to the sending device, and then injecting the malicious packet to the receiving device within a narrow time window. If only one device had the vulnerability, the attack would not be successful.

To remedy the vulnerability, the Bluetooth SIG has now updated the [Bluetooth specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/errata) to require products to validate any public key received as part of public key-based security procedures. In addition, the Bluetooth SIG has added testing for this vulnerability within our Bluetooth Qualification Program.

There is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited maliciously and the Bluetooth SIG is not aware of any devices implementing the attack having been developed, including by the researchers who identified the vulnerability. The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedy to our member companies, and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches. As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/304725).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1654809#c0)  Timothy Redaelli    2018-11-29 17:58:27 UTC  ``` DPDK 18.11 requires storm firmware version 8.37.7.0 (/lib/firmware/qed/qed_init_values-8.37.7.0.bin).  On last linux-firmware (linux-firmware-20180911-69.git85c5d90.el7) only 8.33.12.0 is available.  <https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/nics/qede.html#prerequisites>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1654809#c2)  Timothy Redaelli    2018-11-29 19:22:54 UTC  ``` From git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git  commit c7ba355ef94cc85c49f14f76a7a826c46fa12ae1 Author: Mody, Rasesh <Rasesh.Mody> Date:   Wed Oct 24 00:23:59 2018 +0000      qed: Add 8.37.7.0 firmware image          This patch adds new 8.37.7.0 firmware image for qed* adpaters with     enhancements and fixes.          Signed-off-by: Rasesh Mody <rasesh.mody>     Signed-off-by: Josh Boyer <jwboyer>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1654809#c3)  Bruno Meneguele    2018-12-10 16:22:16 UTC  ``` Hi Amnon,  before 7.6.z can be accepted we're going to need to understand the needs behind it, for instance, for z-stream we can't accept any firmware that enables new features for z-stream kernel drivers. In other words, if RHEL 7.6.z kernel driver for qed has any access the new features brought by this new version we can't update the package for z-stream. BUT, if only bugfixes will affect kernel driver we need at least a hint on the bugs being solved there and also a confirmation that the vendor will help RedHat's QE to test the firmware once it's updated, by setting OtherQA flag, since we can't just perform a sanity check for z-stream.  Because of that, if you don't have all these informations, feel free to bring any vendor/partner engineer to the discussion to help us to understand the needs. Unfortunately I can't move forward before we have these questions answered. Actually I'm no even the one responsible to get the z-stream flag set, you'll need to reach PM for that, but these questions will, for sure, help to make it move faster.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1654809#c5)  Zhang Kexin    2018-12-14 05:39:58 UTC  ``` Hi Tim,  What will happen if we use old firmware version when testing dpdk18.11?

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1702330#c0)  Simon Horman    2019-04-23 13:57:48 UTC  ``` In order to support offload of OVS tunnels where the tunnel endpoint is on an OvS bridge Netronome would like to request inclusion of an updated flower firmware for Netronome Agilio SmartNICs in RHEL7.7.  This relates to a driver update described in [BZ1700452](show_bug.cgi?id=1700452)  The updated firmware is present in the upstream linux-firmware project and the following commit can be pulled from <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/>  author	Louis Peens <louis.peens>	2019-03-14 14:39:58 +0200 committer	Louis Peens <louis.peens>	2019-03-15 10:14:52 +0200 commit	7f4139400b8d1b9f2e2eabda5f9d99178fa6b597 (patch) tree	a781fcca66d90106d8301ee4b388a01510b4a032 parent	7bc246451318b3536d9bfd3c4e46d541a9831b33 (diff) download	linux-firmware-7f4139400b8d1b9f2e2eabda5f9d99178fa6b597.tar.gz nfp: update Agilio SmartNIC flower firmware to rev AOTC-2.10.A.23 New in this release:   - Add support for Agilio LX cards  Improvements:   - Improve tunnel setup time in low traffic rate scenarios  Signed-off-by: Louis Peens <louis.peens> Tested-by: Charles Murcott <charles.murcott> Acked-by: Simon Horman <simon.horman>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1702330#c4)  Bruno Meneguele    2019-04-23 19:41:35 UTC  ``` Thanks for the info. Will update the pkg soon.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1702330#c5)  Rachel Sibley    2019-04-25 14:55:50 UTC  ``` @kexin can you assign and provide ack/nack for this bug ? Thank you !   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1702330#c6)  Simon Horman    2019-05-01 14:50:37 UTC  ``` Hi,  I had a brief discussion with Jonathan Toppins and others this afternoon about the relationship between this ticket and [BZ1673890](show_bug.cgi?id=1673890).  In short, I believe everything is in order.  In more detail:  This ticket requests an update to the Flower firmware included in RHEL 7.7 for Netronome Agilio SmartNICs whereas [BZ1673890](show_bug.cgi?id=1673890) requests an update to the basic firmware (a different firmware build) included in RHEL 8.0 (errata).  During the discussion I stated that the update requested in this ticket would bring RHEL 7.7 up-to-date with respect to RHEL 8.0 for Flower firmware. As both firmwares mentioned above use the same upstream, linux-firmware, there was a concern that the update requested in this ticket may cause a regression in the basic firmware.  This is not the case because I was mistaken and the update requested in this ticket would bring RHEL 7.7 up-to-date with respect to the current request to include updated firmware in RHEL 8.1 (n.b. not RHEL 8.0), as per [BZ1663989](show_bug.cgi?id=1663989 "CLOSED ERRATA - [NETRO 8.1 Feat] Pull new version of Netronome firmware"). I have checked and the upstream linux-firmware commit[1] that this ticket and [BZ1663989](show_bug.cgi?id=1663989 "CLOSED ERRATA - [NETRO 8.1 Feat] Pull new version of Netronome firmware") request an update to includes the commit[2] that [BZ1673890](show_bug.cgi?id=1673890) requests an update to. Thus there should be no known regression introduced from a Netronome point of view.  [1] 7f4139400b8d ("nfp: update Agilio SmartNIC flower firmware to rev AOTC-2.10.A.23") [2] 450632bb7822 ("nfp: update Agilio SmartNIC firmware to rev 2.1.16.1")   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1702330#c10)  LiLiang    2019-07-10 10:38:54 UTC  ``` I confirm linux-firmware contains the correct Netronome flower firmware version.

## Bluetooth implementations may not sufficiently validate elliptic curve parameters during Diffie-Hellman key exchange

#### Vulnerability Note VU#304725

Original Release Date: 2018-07-23 | Last Revised: 2018-08-17

---

### Overview

Bluetooth firmware or operating system software drivers may not sufficiently validate elliptic curve parameters used to generate public keys during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which may allow a remote attacker to obtain the encryption key used by the device.

### Description

| [**CWE-325**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/325.html)**: Missing Required Cryptographic Step** **-** CVE-2018-5383  Bluetooth utilizes a device pairing mechanism based on elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to allow encrypted communication between devices. The ECDH key pair consists of a private and a public key, and the public keys are exchanged to produce a shared pairing key. The devices must also agree on the elliptic curve parameters being used. Previous work on the "Invalid Curve Attack" showed that the ECDH parameters are not always validated before being used in computing the resulted shared key, which reduces attacker effort to obtain the private key of the device under attack if the implementation does not validate all of the parameters before computing the shared key.In some implementations, the elliptic curve parameters are not all validated by the cryptographic algorithm implementation, which may allow a remote attacker within wireless range to inject an invalid public key to determine the session key with high probability. Such an attacker can then passively intercept and decrypt all device messages, and/or forge and inject malicious messages.Both Bluetooth low energy (LE) implementations of Secure Connections Pairing in operating system software and BR/EDR implementations of Secure Simple Pairing in device firmware may be affected. Bluetooth device users are encouraged to consult with their device vendor for further information.Since the vulnerability was identified, the Bluetooth SIG has updated the Bluetooth specifications to require validation of any public key received as part of public key-based security procedures, thereby providing a remedy to the vulnerability from a specification perspective. In addition, the Bluetooth SIG has added testing for this vulnerability within its Bluetooth Qualification Program. The Bluetooth SIG has also released a [public statement](https://www.bluetooth.com/news/unknown/2018/07/bluetooth-sig-security-update) regarding the vulnerability.More information can be found on the [researchers' website](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/BT). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated, remote attacker within range may be able to utilize a man-in-the-middle network position to determine the cryptographic keys used by the device. The attacker can then intercept and decrypt and/or forge and inject device messages. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Both software and firmware updates are expected over the coming weeks. Affected users should check with their device vendor for availability of updates. Further information for vendors is provided in the Vendor Status section below. |

Package        : firmware-nonfree
Version        : 20161130-5~deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5383

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered a cryptographic weakness in the
Bluetooth LE SC pairing protocol, called the Fixed Coordinate Invalid
Curve Attack (CVE-2018-5383).  Depending on the devices used, this
could be exploited by a nearby attacker to obtain sensitive
information, for denial of service, or for other security impact.

This flaw has been fixed in firmware for Intel Wireless 7260 (B3),
7260 (B5), 7265 (D1), and 8264 adapters, and for Qualcomm Atheros
QCA61x4 "ROME" version 3.2 adapters.  Other Bluetooth adapters are
also affected and remain vulnerable.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
20161130-5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

AppleTalk implementation in the Linux kernel if an error occurs during

initialization. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15292](/security/CVE-2019-15292))

It was discovered that the Empia EM28xx DVB USB device driver

implementation in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability

when disconnecting the device. An attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-2024](/security/CVE-2019-2024))

It was discovered that the USB video device class implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate control bits, resulting in an out of

bounds buffer read. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-2101](/security/CVE-2019-2101))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the

virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.

Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper B. Rasmussen discovered

that the Bluetooth protocol BR/EDR specification did not properly require

sufficiently strong encryption key lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-9506](/security/CVE-2019-9506))

It was discovered that the Appletalk IP encapsulation driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly prevent kernel addresses from being copied to user

space. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could use this to

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-20511](/security/CVE-2018-20511))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the USB YUREX device

driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15216](/security/CVE-2019-15216))

It was discovered that the Siano USB MDTV receiver device driver in the

Linux kernel made improper assumptions about the device characteristics. A

physically proximate attacker could use this cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15218](/security/CVE-2019-15218))

It was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate data size information from the device. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-15221](/security/CVE-2019-15221))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-4095-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

13 August 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4095-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-11833](/security/CVE-2019-11833))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel on ARM processors allowed a tracing

process to modify a syscall after a seccomp decision had been made on that

syscall. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass seccomp

restrictions. ([CVE-2019-2054](/security/CVE-2019-2054))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Breaking the Bluetooth Pairing:Fixed Coordinate Invalid Curve Attack

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann

## Introduction

The Fixed Coordinate Invalid Curve Attack is a new attack, which could be applied to all current Bluetooth pairing protocols.

The pairing protocol is the process of connection establishment in Bluetooth. This process supplies the ground for all of the security and privacy features provided by Bluetooth. Failing to secure this process compromises the entire Bluetooth session.

Our new attack provides a new technique for attacking the Bluetooth pairing protocol by manipulating specific messages, without being detected by the victim devices. Our attack relies on a newly discovered protocol design flaws.

Using our attack, one can exploit this vulnerability in order to reveal the encryption key of the victim devices and use it in order to decrypt and forge data without user awareness.

## Academic paper

* The paper is [here](bt-fixed-coordinate-invalid-curve-attack.pdf).
* The technion's press release is [here](technion-press-release.pdf) (and [here](technion-press-release-hebrew.pdf) in Hebrew).

## Disclosure and Vendors' Information

* CVE-2018-5383 was assigned to the vulnerability in the Bluetooth protocol.
  * Cert/CC's publication is [here](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/304725). Notice that they list Microsoft as "not affected" because Microsoft implements an old version of the standard, which is even less secure, rather than the broken contemporary standard. Microsoft had recenly added Bluetooth 5.0 support to their Windows 10 implemetation (skipping 4.2), which may have been implemeted securely.
  * Bluetooth SIG security update is [here](http://www.bluetooth.com/news/unknown/2018/07/bluetooth-sig-security-update). It is odd to read that "It is possible that some vendors may have developed Bluetooth products that support those features but do not perform public key validation" - the standard did not require it at all, thus the standard itself was the problem - not the vendors.
  * Google's patch was included in their June 2018 update. See their June 2018 bulletin [here](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-06-01).
  * Intel's publication is [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00128.html).
  * Apple's publication for MacOS is [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208849) and [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208937).
  * Apple's publication for iOS is [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208848).
  * Lenovo information is [here](https://support.lenovo.com/bo/he/downloads/ds121010).
  * Samsung information is [here](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb).
  * LG's reference is [here](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html).
  * Huawei's reference is [here](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/bulletin/2018/7).
  * Dell's fix is [here](https://www.dell.com/support/home/gr/el/dhs/drivers/driversdetails?driverid=5dv5x&lwp=rt).

## Questions & Answers

#### Am I affected by the vulnerability?

It is very likely that you are either affected or vulnerable to older attacks.

#### Do both devices have to be vulnerable?

Yes, the attack exploits the vulnerability on both participating devices simultaneously. If any one of them is patched, the attack will not work any more.

#### What are the implications of the attack?

Every Bluetooth pairing performed by vulnerable devices (vast majority of the market) at the presence of the attacker could be compromised. An attacker could then eavesdrop all victims' communications, and even send forged requests for information. For example, an attacker can ask a phone for the contacts list, read or send SMSes, dial and talk on a compromized connection, and listen in to all Bluetooth conversations.

#### What is the difference between Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (aka. Bluetooth Smart)?

Bluetooth Low Energy first introduced in 2010 is intended for use by IoT and low power devices. The original Bluetooth is still widely used by audio peripherals. Although they are different in many aspects, Bluetooth Low Energy is largely inspired by the original Bluetooth. These differences do not affect our attack.

#### What happens if the attack fails?

On failure the participating devices cancel the pairing procedure, and might notify the user of authentication failure. The user may try again immediately afterwards. Therefore, on success of pairing, the attack had certainly been succeeded.

#### Can I detect if someone is attacking me?

On success the attack is undetectable by the user. When it fails the user may be notified of authentication failure, yet this behavior is implementation dependent. In any case current devices cannot distinguish between our attack and a normal authentication failure.

#### Has this attack been applied in the wild?

We are not familiar with any such incident.

#### What information could be compromised?

Today Bluetooth may carry a large variety of sensitive information:

* Bluetooth headsets may receive and transmit audio, such as phone conversations, music, podcasts, etc.
* Mobile phones may transmit health information, SMS content, contacts lists, and emails to nearby wearables.
* Wireless keyboards transmit keystrokes which may contain sensitive information (including passwords).
* IoT devices transmit various kinds of sensitive information, e.g., smart-locks transmit digital key in order to open.

#### Which platforms are affected by this attack?

As far as we know every Bluetooth chip manufactured by Intel, Broadcom or Qualcomm is affected. Therefore, almost any device, including smartphones and headsets of all types, are affected.
In addition, the Android Bluetooth stack (Bluedroid) is affected when using Bluetooth smart.
Apple had provided patches for both MacOS and iOS.
The Windows Bluetooth smart stack did not implement the lastest Bluetooth smart protocol and is therefore still vulnerable to older and simpler attacks.

#### What is the Invalid Curve Attack?

In order to exchange secret information over a public channel Bluetooth uses a mathematical structure called elliptic-curve. Due to insufficient validation an attacker could send an "invalid" point, which does not satisfy the mathematical properties of the elliptic-curve. By leveraging this phenomenon the attacker can compromise the secrets exchanged by the victim.

#### What is the recommended mitigation for platform developers?

The recommended and the most straight-forward mitigation is to validate that a given point satisfies the the elliptic-curve equation.

#### What is the recommended mitigation for users?

For users we can only recommend to verify that at least one of the paired devices has the patched version applied. Just make sure your smartphone is updated with the latest patches. Check with your vendor that both the chip and the operating system are patched (as the chip update fixes traditional Bluetooth connections, while the operating system update fixes Bluetooth LE connections).

#### How did you discover the problem?

We discovered the problem mainly by exhaustively reading the Bluetooth core specification. After considering the attack we used a programmable Bluetooth dongle in order to test devices for the vulnerability.

#### Who are you?

The researchers are part of a research team in the Technion in Israel which specializes in security and cryptography. Prof. [Eli Biham](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/) is an expert in cryptanalysis and cyber security, and has a record of discovering vulnerabilities in widely used ciphers and communication systems (such as GSM cellular phones and car remote controls). He is a professor at the [computer science department](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/) and serves as the head of the Technion's [Hiroshi Fujiwara cyber security research center](http://cyber.technion.ac.il/). Lior Neumann is a graduate student at the Technion, in the computer science department, and specializes in Bluetooth security.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the CERT Coordination Center for the great help in coordinating between all of the many affected vendors. We would also like to acknowledge the Bluetooth SIG, Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Google for discussing and addressing the vulnerability.
