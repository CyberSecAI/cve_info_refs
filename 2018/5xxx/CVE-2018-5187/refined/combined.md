Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:60.3.0-1~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

It appears there aren't any checks for bundled web extension experiments.
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f65d7528e34ef1a7665b4a1a7b7cdb1388fcd3aa/toolkit/components/extensions/Extension.jsm#632> doesn't check for privileged permissions.
experimentsAllowed appears never to be used:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f65d7528e34ef1a7665b4a1a7b7cdb1388fcd3aa/toolkit/components/extensions/Extension.jsm#1355>
I compiled the code with isPrivileged and experimentsAllowed hard coded to return false. I was still able to load an XPI built by web-ext build which was a bundled experiment through about:debugging.
This was able to set preferences etc. Is there something I am missing here?

This appears that [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") wouldn't be needed currently as the code isn't used in the evaluation of if an extension can have an experiment.
If the idea is that an extension is filtered out by AMO then perhaps this is fine too?

I just submitted an unlisted addon to AMO and got lint errors: "experiments.rollout is not supported" but it did not reject signing on that.
I was able to install this signed XPI to release 59.0.1

This includes the check I had for [Bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") however I couldn't find a way to check the isSystem from this bit of code.
However it seemed like it would be good to bundle the patches together.

I just verified my patch still works as a temp addon in about:debugging but not installing through about:addons. (not that I am even sure if we want users to install an xpi as a temp addon and get this behaviour either)

OK, then. Please request beta uplift before you land so we can land on both channels at once. And please land this patch as part of the bug to allow experiments in system add-ons. If you can add a stealth test, so much the better.
We can watch for new signatures while that rolls out.

Is it possible to land the patch after [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") is resolved? How long would [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") take until it is deployed on AMO? The risk of detection would be much lower if AMO had been fixed up already.

|  | |

At this point, this only affects nightly and beta users, so there's not too much risk of this being exploited. I'd rather land the fix sooner than wait for AMO. We can always block any experiment extensions if they're signed in the meantime.

Oh, did it land in 59? That's unfortunate. It might make sense to land the AMO fix first, then, but I'd still lean towards watching and blocklisting. We should be able to block before any add-ons get significant distribution.

In general they shouldn't, but I want this landed as part of [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"), with tests. We should be able to add tests for all of the cases there without drawing attention to this one.

This should probably be something like installLocation.isSystem. Though maybe this makes more sense, since system add-ons in other location shoud be signed, anyway.
Still needs a test. Please submit that for review in [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"). I'd rather not draw atrention to that by reviewing out of band.

It sounds like a good idea to me to submit all of the code for review in [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") and just leave this bug without patches.

Anyway my plan is to throw this into the [Bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") when we are happy with it to minimize noise in that bug.

CC'ing Lizzard to make sure this probable late 60 uplift is noted. Liz, there are plans to include this patch in the one for [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") (and then uplift together, I suppose).
I would also suggest downgrading this to sec-high since [bug 1454939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454939 "VERIFIED FIXED") was resolved and it's no longer a problem on release.

bug-1454909.e.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not very, we now have mitigations in AMO
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
59+
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I plan to uplift, it should cleanly apply to 60.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
The chance of regressions is low, we have more tests and the only "risk" is with system addons with experiments which currently don't exist.

jonathan, and aswan, does this resolve the issues mentioned by aswan in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1454820#c3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") ?
Are you planning to land patches with uplift requests in both this bug and that other bug?
It's late in beta but we still have the beta 16 build and next week's RC so I'd like to get this into 60.0b16 if Al gives sec approval.Flags: needinfo?(jkt)Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

My plan was now to move this patch into [bug 1454820](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM") and mark as uplift there, not mentioning anything security there in public view.
> does this resolve the issues mentioned by aswan...
Yeah I will override the patch there with this one.
So I will ask for :johannh's approval tomorrow on the other bug with the exact same patch, as he will be in the same room and we have the correct approvals here anyway.
Unless :lizzard it would be better to move this public as close to 60.0b16 as possible?Flags: needinfo?(jkt) → needinfo?(lhenry)

Just post the patch to the public bug now. It doesn't do anything to draw more attention it than it already has, and the routes to exploit have been closed by the AMO patches anyway.

Just to clarify [bug 1454820 comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1454820#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - bundled WebExtension experiments do not work for SIGNEDSTATE_SYSTEM"), which I left intentionally vague:
It's no longer possible to exploit this bug in release channels, since AMO will no longer sign extensions with embedded experiments, and release channels won't load unsigned extensions. So I don't think it's necessary to uplift the fix to 60.
That said, if we do plan to ship system add-ons with bundled experiments to 60, doing so without uplifting that patch would look suspicious, so in that case the uplift would probably still make sense.
Updating the severity to reflect the current state of affairs. This is no longer exploitable without an exploit on the AMO side which would cause it to sign these extensions, which makes it sec-moderate.Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2018-12368: No warning when opening executable SettingContent-ms files](#CVE-2018-12368)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems
*Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Package        : thunderbird
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5156 CVE-2018-5187 CVE-2018-12361 CVE-2018-12367
                 CVE-2018-12371

Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird: Multiple memory
safety errors and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service.

Debian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 52.x
series has ended, so starting with this update we're now following the
60.x releases.

Between 52.x and 60.x, Thunderbird has undergone significant internal
updates, which makes it incompatible with a number of extensions. For
more information please refer to
<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-60>

In addition, the new Thunderbird packages require Rust to build. A
compatible Rust toolchain has been backported to Debian stretch, but is
not available for all architectures which previously supported the
purely C++-based Thunderbird packages. Thus, the new Thunderbird packages
don't support the mips, mips64el and mipsel architectures at this point.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:60.0-3~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

For the detailed security status of thunderbird please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/thunderbird>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

As an attacker, initial access can prove to be quite the challenge against a hardened target. When selecting a payload for initial access, an attacker has to select a file format that allows arbitrary code execution or shell command execution with minimal user interaction. These file formats can be sparse, which is why attackers have relied on file types like .HTAs, Office macros, .VBS, .JS, etc. There are obviously a finite number of built-in file extensions on Windows, and as defenses improve, the number of effective payloads continues to shrink.

Additionally, an attacker has to get that file to the end user in a way that will result in execution. Again, options for this can be limited as directly linking to payloads or attaching them to emails tend to get blocked by antivirus or browser protections. This is why attackers have resorted to Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), ZIP files, etc. To combat the file delivery vector, Office 2016 introduced [blocking all of the “dangerous” file formats](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Packager-Activation-in-Office-2016-52808039-4A7C-4550-BE3A-869DD338D834) from being embedded via OLE by default. This reduces the effectiveness of one of the most relied upon payload delivery methods. When trying to activate a blocked file extension, Office will throw an error and prevent execution:

![]()

Office 2016 blocking one of many “dangerous” file extensions

In addition to OLE blocking, Microsoft also introduced [Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) into Windows 10 (which requires Windows Defender AV as a dependency). The purpose of these rules are to reduce the functionality that an attacker can abuse or exploit to obtain code-execution on the system. One of the most touted and effective ASR rules is “Block Office applications from creating child processes”. This rule will block any attempt to spawn a process as a child of an Office application:

![]()

Attack Surface Reduction Rules blocking Office child processes

When you combine OLE blocking and ASR together, the options to execute code on an endpoint from the internet become a little more limited. Most useful file types can’t be delivered via OLE per the new block in Office 2016, and ASR’s child process creation rule prevents any instances of a child process spawning under an Office application.

How could we circumvent these controls? I first decided to tackle the file format problem. I spent a lot of hours going through the registry looking for new file formats that might allow execution. Most of these formats can be found in the root of the HKCR:\ registry hive. The process involved pulling all of the registered file formats out and then looking at them to see if the format itself allowed for anything interesting.

After countless hours reading file specifications, I stumbled across the “.SettingContent-ms” file type. This format was introduced in Windows 10 and allows a user to create “shortcuts” to various Windows 10 setting pages. These files are simply XML and contain paths to various Windows 10 settings binaries. An example .SettingContent-ms file will look like this:

![]()

Normal SettingContent-ms file for the Windows Control Panel

All this file does is open the Control Panel for the user. The interesting aspect of this file is the **<DeepLink>** element in the schema. This element takes any binary with parameters and executes it. What happens if we simply substitute “control.exe” to something like “cmd.exe /c calc.exe”?

![]()

Replacing the <DeepLink> element with an attacker controlled value

Then if we double-click the file:

![]()

Execution of the modified SettingContent-ms file

What is interesting is that when double-clicking the file, there is no “open” prompt. Windows goes straight to executing the command.

Great! So we have a file format that allows shell command execution via a file open. This solves the “what file format to use” problem of initial access. Now, how can we deliver it? My next thought was to see what happens if this file comes straight from the internet via a link.

Execution of a SettingContent-ms file directly from the internet via a hyperlink

Yikes!! When this file comes straight from the internet, it executes as soon as the user clicks “open”. Looking at the streams of the file, you will notice that it does indeed grab [Mark-Of-The-Web](https://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2018/Content/Flare/Targets/More/Adding-MOTW.htm):

![]()

The MOTW ADS being applied to the downloaded

When looking up the [ZoneIds online](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131104-00/?p=2753), “3” equals “URLZONE\_INTERNET”. For one reason or another, the file still executes without any notification or warning to the user.

So, we now have a file type that allows arbitrary shell command execution and displays zero warnings or dialogues to the user. When trying to get initial access, going across a target’s perimeter with an unusual file type can be risky. Ideally, this file would be placed in a container of a more common file type, such as an Office document.

As mentioned before, Office 2016 blocks a preset list of “known bad” file types when embedded with [Object Linking and Embedding](https://enigma0x3.net/2016/03/15/phishing-with-empire/). The SettingContent-ms file format, however, is not included in [that list](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Packager-Activation-in-Office-2016-52808039-4A7C-4550-BE3A-869DD338D834):

![]()

Office 2016 OLE block list not blocking the SettingContent-ms file

At this point, we can evade the Office 2016 OLE file extension block by embedding a malicious .SettingContent-ms file via OLE:

![]()

Office 2016 OLE block list not blocking the SettingContent-ms file

When a document comes from the internet with a .SettingContent-ms file embedded in it, the only thing the user sees is the “Open Package Contents” prompt. Clicking “Open” will result in execution. If an environment doesn’t have any Attack Surface Reduction rules enabled, this is all an attacker needs to execute code on the endpoint. I was curious, so I poked at how this holds up with ASR’s child process creation rules enabled. **It is also worth noting that at of the time of this post, ASR rules do not appear to work on Office if Office was installed from the Windows Store.**

[Enabling these rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-attack-surface-reduction) is pretty simple, and can be done with one PowerShell command: “Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules\_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules\_Actions Enabled”

The <rule ID> parameter is the GUID of the rule you want to enabled. You can find the GUID for each ASR rule documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard). For this test, I want to enable the Child Process Creation rule, which is GUID D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A.

After enabling the rule, the attack no longer works:

![]()

Attack Surface Reduction rule blocking SettingContent-ms execution

Since the rule is designed to block child processes from being spawned from an Office application, our payload executed, but the rule blocked the command. This got me thinking into how ASR achieves that without breaking some functionality. I first started to just test random binaries in random paths to see if ASR was blocking based on the image path. This was quite time consuming and didn’t get me very far.

I ended up taking a step back and thinking about what parts of Office have to work. After running ProcMon and looking at Process Explorer for a little bit while clicking around in Word, I noticed that there were still child processes being spawned by Word.

![]()

Valid child process creation of Word

This makes sense, as Office needs to use features that rely on other programs. I thought that maybe the ASR rule blocks child processes based on image path, but images in the Office path are allowed to be spawned when features are activated.

To test this theory, I changed my .SettingContent-ms file to the path of “Excel.exe”:

![]()

Changing the <DeepLink> element to Excel.exe

The next step is to embed this new file into a Word document and see if ASR blocks “Excel.exe” from being spawned.

![]()

Excel spawning under winword via modified SettingContent-ms file

Interestingly enough, ASR allows Excel to start. So the child process creation ASR rule appears to be making decisions based on whitelisted paths.

This sent me down a long, long path of trying to find a binary I could use that existed in the path “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office”. After going through a few of them and passing “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” to them as a parameter on the command line, one of them kicked:

![]()

Execution of commands via ASR whitelisted “AppVLP.exe”

Perfect! We are able to abuse “AppVLP” to execute shell commands. Normally, this binary is used for Application Virtualization, but we can use it as an abuse binary to circumvent the ASR file path rule. To test this full chain, I updated my .SettingContent-ms file to look like this:

![]()

Final OLE/ASR evasion payload

Now, the file just needs embedded into an Office document and executed:

![]()

Evading the OLE block with .SettingContent-ms and ASR with AppVLP.exe

As you can see, with Office 2016’s OLE block rule and ASR’s Child Process Creation rule enabled, .SettingContent-ms files combined with “AppVLP.exe” in the Office folder allow us to circumvent these controls and execute arbitrary commands.

While Office documents are often marked with MOTW and are opened in the [Protected View Sandbox](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-protected-view-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653), there are file formats that allow OLE and aren’t triggered by the Protected View sandbox. You can find more on that [here](/phishing-against-protected-view-enigma0x3-on-wordpress-com-eed399fca512).

**Wrap Up:**

After looking into ASR and the new file formats in Windows 10, I realized that it is important to try and audit new binaries and file types that get added in each release of Windows. In this case, the .SettingContent-ms extension can allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the latest version of Windows while evading ASR and Office 2016 OLE blocks. Additionally, the file type appears to give execution (even from the internet) immediately after it’s opened, despite having the MOTW applied.

**Defenses:**

Great, so what can you do about it? Ultimately, a .SettingContent-ms file should not be executing anywhere outside of the “C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel” path. Additionally, since the file format only allows for executing shell commands, anything being run through that file is subject to command line logging.

It is also a good idea to always monitor child process creations from Office applications. There are a few applications that should be spawning under the Office applications, so monitoring for outliers can be useful. One tool that can accomplish this is [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

Another option is to neuter the file format by killing its handler. I have **NOT** tested this extensively and can offer no guarantee that something within Windows won’t break by doing this. For those who want to play around with the implications of killing the handler to the .SettingContent-ms file format, you can set the “DelegateExecute” key in “HKCR:\SettingContent\Shell\Open\Command” to be empty. Again, this might break functionality on the OS, so proceed with caution.

You can find a PoC SettingContent-ms file here: <https://gist.github.com/enigma0x3/b948b81717fd6b72e0a4baca033e07f8>

**Reporting timeline:**

As committed as SpecterOps is to transparency ([https://posts.specterops.io/a-push-toward-transparency-c385a0dd1e34](/a-push-toward-transparency-c385a0dd1e34)), we acknowledge the rate at which attackers adopt new offensive techniques once they are made public. This is why prior to publicization of a new offensive technique, we regularly inform the respective vendor of the issue, supply ample time to mitigate the issue, and notify select, trusted vendors in order to ensure detections can be delivered to their customers as quickly as possible.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.79 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Download attached SettingContent-ms file, or install attached extension for RCE.
Actual results:
SettingContent-ms is a new windows 10 extension that can be used to execute arbitrary local files with parameters.
Expected results:
Treat it as executable.
I am CCing Matt Nelson who originally found this file, I simply connected the dots with the browser RCE potential.
He wrote about this file in public <https://posts.specterops.io/the-tale-of-settingcontent-ms-files-f1ea253e4d39>
Web Extension RCE part is not mentioned.

Bob, do you have any idea what we should do with this? It looks like it could be kind of Windows platform integration-y.Flags: needinfo?(bobowencode)

FWIW, this was reported to MSRC and they responded that the severity of the issue is below the bar for servicing and that the case will be closed.

I should be more clear, the "this" in the above comment was the .SettingContent-ms file format. The MS disclosure timeline is at the bottom of this post: <https://posts.specterops.io/the-tale-of-settingcontent-ms-files-f1ea253e4d39>

Would also like to highlight an important part of the article Matt wrote (in case you didn't read it, worth a read tho!) - The mark of web is created for the file once downloaded with healthy content, but for some reason windows does not show any warning before executing. So this is a clean RCE requiring a single user click. (after installing malicious extension ofc)

The extension is calling browser.downloads.open, at which point the OS is up to protect you against arbitrary RCE. Microsoft is apparently considering this issue too low severity to fix. Now, we could either follow them and WONTFIX or we say that we consider this severe enough to add a blacklist of sorts to prevent opening this filetype via the downloads API.
In any case it seems to me like that decision should be made at the WebExtensions API level, so moving this to WebExtensions for now...Group: firefox-core-security → toolkit-core-securityComponent: Untriaged → WebExtensions: UntriagedProduct: Firefox → Toolkit

I thought we had a similar blacklist to what Windows does in terms of which files are executable, e.g. the stuff in $PATHEXT or whatever the env var is? I would expect us to warn for calling downloads.open() on this filetype in the same way as when a user clicks a download that would pop up the 'this file is executable, are you sure you want to run it' warning.
:paolo might know more about this too, but he's not accepting needinfo requests...

Attached patch

[The patch](attachment.cgi?id=8985901&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8985901&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1468217&attachment=8985901)

Adding "SettingContent-ms" to the list of executable file extensions solves the issue of the missing warning, both when opening from the Downloads Panel and from extension code.
In fact, we had other cases where Windows didn't warn before executing some file types even when they had the zone information, hence we now display our own warning dialog for every executable extension except "exe", even if it may be redundant.
The patch is straightforward and the general issue is public, so I've just stated what it does in the commit message, without any details on the steps to reproduce.
I already tested this with a local build that I ran on Windows 10. I believe it should be quite safe to land the patch in all branches, even at RC stage, so it may be already available to users in the release next week.Assignee: nobody → paolo.mozmailStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

The patch
Since this patch is quite straightforward, I'm already requesting the uplift flags so we can get this on the Release Management radar sooner. As mentioned in the previous comment, I think this is quite safe to land on all branches.
Let us know if you'd like us to land this on mozilla-central first, or just have the sheriffs land everywhere at the same time.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Recently announced security issue
[User impact if declined]: Code execution on the local machine without warning if an extension creates a file with a "SettingContent-ms" extension
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Not automatically testable, it effectively patches a Windows issue with a missing warning even if the file is correctly marked as having a remote source
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Yes, but only on one local build
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Yes, using the proof of concept attached to this bug
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None
[Is the change risky?]: Very low risk
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This only affects the download and file opening code path, and we don't actually use this file extension for anything in the source tree anyways.
[String changes made/needed]: None
[If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration]: Improves security from code execution on the local machine with minimal risk.

This needs to get sec-approval first (or at least be assessed a sec rating of moderate or lower) before it can land. Also, we're about to build the RC of Fx61, so I'm a bit iffy about taking this at this point in the cycle.

Looks like AssocIsDangerous is what Explorer itself uses. Ironically it doesn't appear to pick up ".settingcontent-ms" when testing on my machine.

Dan/Al, can you rate this?
As filed, the webextensions side of things is limited to sec-moderate anyway, so then it wouldn't need sec-approval.
I don't think the "manual" download + open side of things is severe enough to be sec-high/sec-crit, but even if it is, given the time in the cycle we're at and the safety of the patch (1 entry addition to a list of file extensions), I think we should just land this on all branches in time for shipping 61.

So, to be really clear, I think this is about as safe a C++ patch as we're likely to see, and we should take it.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(abillings)

Thanks Gijs for landing this sooner, I was traveling today.

This may be the reason why Windows Explorer does not warn about the file, as the documentation mentions that "ShellExecuteEx uses AssocIsDangerous to trigger zone checking".
Ideally we would have a way to serve additional entries in this list remotely using one of the already available mechanisms, or at least have the list defined in JavaScript so we could use a hotfix if necessary. We can also supplement the list using AssocIsDangerous, but it wouldn't handle cases like this bug.
While we're thinking about possible improvements, one thing I noticed is that the warning can be disabled globally and permanently using the checkbox. I think this ability should be removed, because it applies to every file type, not just the individual file being opened, and also applies to actions triggered by browser extensions. This is unclear from the current user interface, and there is no way to undo this action save from editing "about:config".Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

Can you file bugs for these follow-ups? I think we should at least split off the webextensions usage from the 'normal' usage of the pref (ie prompt for the webext case even if the user turns off the prompt generally).

Yes, I planned to do this next week after the release.
For the checkbox, I can consider replacing it with two separate "about:config" settings, but if there is no way to undo the choice from "about:preferences" then I don't think we should have the checkbox in the first place. The equivalent Windows warnings can also only be disabled globally from the registry. We can also ask the UX team for an opinion on this. We should also not reuse the existing "about:config" setting just in case users disabled the warning accidentally, possibly years in the past.

In your case, the file was downloaded with a ".xml" extension, which depends on the content type of the attachment, which is "application/xml". Whether the extension is added or not may depend on the local configuration, but when it's added, there is no security issue because the file will not be executed by Windows.
The link Matt provided may solve this issue. If this doesn't you may have to set up a local HTTP server, which is what I did for testing.

This can be an issue with the build being tested not having the patch, the preference to disable the warning being accidentally enabled in the profile, or the WebExtensions API not going through the same code path as the newer versions.
If you can test the Downloads Panel flow there, this will tell us if we are in the latter scenario.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail)

I don't know how to go from the build date to the exact changeset from which it was built, so we can verify that the revision from [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1468217#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - .SettingContent-ms file extension bypasses 'dangerous file' prompt leading to WebExt RCE") is actually included. Ryan, can you help here? This is the first thing that I would check, since the verification fails on both the Downloads Panel flow and the extension flow, which is strange.Flags: needinfo?(paolo.mozmail) → needinfo?(ryanvm)

Apparently not since the blog post was about getting Microsoft's star application to open these files, because it's not on the list they use either.

[bug 1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows") looks like it would land pretty cleanly so I could support taking it. ESR-52 doesn't have WebExtensions, but without [bug 1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows") the problem is arguably worse.Depends on: [1369771](/show_bug.cgi?id=1369771 "VERIFIED FIXED - Confirm launching executable more often on Windows")Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Regarding AssocIsDangerous, it’s a good API to use. I’m reaching out to MS to see if they will consider adding this file format, but if they do, it will probably only be in new Windows 10 builds.

Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Windows 10 does not warn users before opening executable files with the `SettingContent-ms` extension even when they have been downloaded from the internet and have the "Mark of the Web." Without the warning, unsuspecting users unfamiliar with this new file type might run an unwanted executable. This also allows a WebExtension with the limited `downloads.open` permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, read uninitialized

memory, bypass same-origin restrictions, bypass CORS restrictions,

bypass CSRF protections, obtain sensitive information, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5156](/security/CVE-2018-5156), [CVE-2018-5186](/security/CVE-2018-5186), [CVE-2018-5187](/security/CVE-2018-5187),

[CVE-2018-12371](/security/CVE-2018-12371))

A security issue was discovered with WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to obtain full browser permissions.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
