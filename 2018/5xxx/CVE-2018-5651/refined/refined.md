{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress plugin 'dark-mode' does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `dark_mode_start` and `dark_mode_end` parameters when a user visits the profile page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user profile settings. When a user with higher privileges, like a manager, visits the profile page, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `dark_mode_start` and `dark_mode_end` parameters when a user updates their profile.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have at least 'contributor' privileges to access the profile page and the capability to manipulate the aforementioned parameters. They also need the higher privilege user to visit the profile after the malicious input is stored."
