Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-5306

**Vulnerability Description:**
The provided content details multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities found in Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager OSS/Pro. It explicitly states that CVE-2018-5306 covers the XSS vulnerabilities in Nexus 3.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data, leading to the ability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerabilities are present in several areas, including parameters, file uploads, user creation, and server connection settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The `repoId` and `format` parameters of the `healthCheckFileDetail` function are vulnerable.
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   File Upload: JavaScript code can be embedded in filenames during file uploads, leading to execution when the filename is displayed.
    *   User Creation: JavaScript/HTML code can be injected into the username, leading to execution when the username is displayed.
    *   IQ Server Connection: JavaScript/HTML can be injected into the "IQ Server URL" field, leading to execution when the "IQ Server Dashboard" menu item is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage these XSS vulnerabilities to:
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
*   Create arbitrary (administrative) users if the victim has sufficient permissions.
*   Perform stored XSS attacks through the file upload or username injection vulnerabilities.
*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker would need to lure a user into clicking a crafted link containing the malicious payload.
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   File Upload: An attacker would need to upload a file with a malicious filename.
    *   User Creation: An attacker would need to create a user account with a malicious username.
    *    IQ Server Connection: An attacker would need to modify the IQ Server URL with a malicious string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   For reflected XSS, the attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a crafted link.
*   For stored XSS through file upload or user creation, the attacker needs to have access to the respective functionalities of the application (e.g., the staging upload or the user creation interface).
*   For stored XSS through IQ Server Connection, the attacker needs to be able to set up/modify the IQ server connection settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that the vulnerabilities were found in version 2.13.0-01, and that none of the patch notes following that version indicated a fix, but the vulnerability also exists in versions <=2.14.5 and <=3.7.1.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in version 2.14.6 and 3.8.0.
*   The advisory indicates that there is no known workaround other than upgrading.
