## Synopsis

Critical: firefox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0122)

## Topic

An update for firefox is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Critical. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.

This update upgrades Firefox to version 52.6.0 ESR.

Security Fix(es):

* Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2018-5089, CVE-2018-5091, CVE-2018-5095, CVE-2018-5096, CVE-2018-5097, CVE-2018-5098, CVE-2018-5099, CVE-2018-5102, CVE-2018-5103, CVE-2018-5104, CVE-2018-5117)
* To mitigate timing-based side-channel attacks similar to "Spectre" and "Meltdown", the resolution of performance.now() has been reduced from 5μs to 20μs.

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, Jason Orendorff, Looben Yang, Anonymous, Nils, and Xisigr as the original reporters.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

# USN-3544-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

24 January 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash, spoof the origin in audio capture prompts, trick the user in to

providing HTTP credentials for another origin, spoof the addressbar

contents, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5089](/security/CVE-2018-5089), [CVE-2018-5090](/security/CVE-2018-5090),

[CVE-2018-5091](/security/CVE-2018-5091), [CVE-2018-5092](/security/CVE-2018-5092), [CVE-2018-5093](/security/CVE-2018-5093), [CVE-2018-5094](/security/CVE-2018-5094), [CVE-2018-5095](/security/CVE-2018-5095),

[CVE-2018-5097](/security/CVE-2018-5097), [CVE-2018-5098](/security/CVE-2018-5098), [CVE-2018-5099](/security/CVE-2018-5099), [CVE-2018-5100](/security/CVE-2018-5100), [CVE-2018-5101](/security/CVE-2018-5101),

[CVE-2018-5102](/security/CVE-2018-5102), [CVE-2018-5103](/security/CVE-2018-5103), [CVE-2018-5104](/security/CVE-2018-5104), [CVE-2018-5109](/security/CVE-2018-5109), [CVE-2018-5114](/security/CVE-2018-5114),

[CVE-2018-5115](/security/CVE-2018-5115), [CVE-2018-5117](/security/CVE-2018-5117), [CVE-2018-5122](/security/CVE-2018-5122))

Multiple security issues were discovered in WebExtensions. If a user were

tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to gain additional privileges, bypass

same-origin restrictions, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5105](/security/CVE-2018-5105),

[CVE-2018-5113](/security/CVE-2018-5113), [CVE-2018-5116](/security/CVE-2018-5116))

A security issue was discovered with the developer tools. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the developer tools

open, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from other origins. ([CVE-2018-5106](/security/CVE-2018-5106))

A security issue was discovered with printing. An attacker could

potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5107](/security/CVE-2018-5107))

It was discovered that manually entered blob URLs could be accessed by

subsequent private browsing tabs. If a user were tricked in to entering

a blob URL, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information from a private browsing context. ([CVE-2018-5108](/security/CVE-2018-5108))

It was discovered that dragging certain specially formatted URLs to the

addressbar could cause the wrong URL to be displayed. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website and dragging a URL to

the addressbar, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the

addressbar contents. ([CVE-2018-5111](/security/CVE-2018-5111))

It was discovered that WebExtension developer tools panels could open

non-relative URLs. If a user were tricked in to installing a specially

crafted extension and running the developer tools, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-5112](/security/CVE-2018-5112))

It was discovered that ActivityStream images can attempt to load local

content through file: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in

combination with another vulnerability that allowed sandbox protections to

be bypassed, in order to obtain sensitive information from local files.

([CVE-2018-5118](/security/CVE-2018-5118))

It was discovered that the reader view will load cross-origin content in

violation of CORS headers. An attacker could exploit this to bypass CORS

restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5119](/security/CVE-2018-5119))

critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, and Jason Orendorff reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 57 and Firefox ESR 52.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This is the first-line reparenting stuff, again. I figured out why this happens...
Here are some notes:
We create the letter frame with aBlockFrame = 0x7f90e39970b0 -> float: none
It's a :-moz-column-content!!!!
We reparent this frame when pulling out placeholders off the first-line.
$90 = (nsBlockFrame \*) 0x7f90e39970b0 -> :-moz-column-content
(rr) p providerFrame
$126 = (nsColumnSetFrame \*) 0x7f90e3997160 -> float: right
Then we reparent the first-letter under it, but:
p correctedFrame
$137 = (nsColumnSetFrame \*) 0x7f90e3997160 -> float: right
Now the first-letter is inconsistent, because it thinks it's floating but it's not.Assignee: nobody → emilioFlags: needinfo?(jfkthame)

0001-Bug-1417661-Use-the-correct-parent-style-for-inherit.patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not much, it's clear what's wrong, but nothing is clear about how this could be exploited, or how could it even lead to something exploitable.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Again, not much, there's a reftest included, because this happens to be a correctness issue too. But it's hard to make it crash. I can also omit the reftest for now if it's preferred, but I'd rather don't.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
Release, beta, and nightly.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Stylo
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
No, but they're trivial to create, I'm pretty sure the patch applies cleanly.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Not much, it's a one-liner that makes the style we inherit from for ::-first-line correct.
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Stylo
[User impact if declined]: Correctness in ::first-letter cases and issues like this bug.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: No
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: No
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: not risky
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: One liner that makes us consistent about the style the ::first-line inherits from.
[String changes made/needed]: none

sec-approval+ for trunk checking on November 28 but ONLY THE FIX, NOT THE TEST. Tests can't be checked in until after the fix ships in a public release (such as 58). You'll need to put the test into a separate patch.
We'll want a beta patch nominated after this lands on trunk as well.

Fair enough, though note that the test doesn't test the security issue, but an observable behavior which is not turnable into something that crashes.
Anyway moving the test to a new patch sounds fine.
> We'll want a beta patch nominated after this lands on trunk as well.
The patch should apply cleanly to beta.

I managed to reproduce the initial issue on the ASAN build that was mentioned in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1417661#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-buffer-overflow in nsFirstLetterFrame::CreateContinuationForFloatingParent"). I can confirm that latest ASAN builds of firefox 58 [1] and firefox 59 [2] are verified fixed using Ubuntu 16.04 x64.

I don't remember the details of it, sorry, I'd need to debug it again :(.
IIRC this was type-confusion or just null-crash after not finding the placeholder property. But again I'd need to debug it again to be certain. Let me know if you want me to do it.Flags: needinfo?(emilio)

Debian Bug     : 885157 885158 887766

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Thunderbird mail
client: Multiple memory safety errors, use after free, integer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to crashes or the execution of
arbitrary code.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
1:52.6.0-1~deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your thunderbird packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

This is from [bug 879717](/show_bug.cgi?id=879717 "VERIFIED FIXED - drawImage on MediaStream assigned to <video> stopped working again") indeed. I have a simple patch coming up that should go cleanly on all affected branches.
It depends on HTMLMediaElement supporting WeakPtr. This was added in 50 by [bug 1267918](/show_bug.cgi?id=1267918 "RESOLVED FIXED - Ensure GMP crash reports are being reported for unencrypted GMP decoding") so even 52 is safe.Blocks: [879717](/show_bug.cgi?id=879717 "VERIFIED FIXED - drawImage on MediaStream assigned to <video> stopped working again")

Lgtm, but using a weakPtr means yielding to the fact that some invariant we thought we had, no longer exists (or never existed).
I'm a bit worried we're merely pushing the problem ahead of us, since HTMLMediaElement::MediaStreamTrackListener 20 lines below uses the exact same pattern.
But from irc I understand OnTracksAvailableCallback is unusually nasty because it's fire and forget, and explicit removal doesn't exist, unlike UnregisterTrackListener(), so this seems like the right approach, and might suffice.

MediaStreamTrackListener is safe since we guarantee to EndSrcMediaStreamPlayback() before destroying the media element (called from both CC and dtor as fallbacks).
(In reply to Jan-Ivar Bruaroey [:jib] (needinfo? me) from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419363#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::NotifyMediaStreamTracksAvailable"))
> Should we maybe log a message or something?
Destroying the media element before the MediaStream has tracks available is valid, so I'm not sure it adds that much. One could probably see that the media element is going away and that tracks become available as explicit events in existing logs.

Switch to WeakPtr
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
It's fairly obvious that this fixes a UAF, and with some code tracing and API knowledge one could probably work out how to trigger it quite easily too. However triggering involves GC so it's not fully deterministic.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No, though the patch itself is pretty clear.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
37 and up, so all supported.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?

Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
This patch should go clean on all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
I don't see any such risk.

I managed to reproduce the initial issue using mozilla-central.pushdate.2017.11.21.20171121095304.firefox.linux64-asan-debug build. Also I can confirm that the latest corresponding builds for Nightly (mozilla-central.pushdate.2018.01.22.20180122111948.firefox.linux64-asan-debug) and ESR (mozilla-esr52.pushdate.2018.01.21.20180121200330.firefox.linux64-asan-debug) are verified fixed using Ubuntu 16.04 x64.
I encountered difficulties for Beta:
- the fuzzPriv extension cannot be installed, even with xpinstall.signatures.required set to false, extensions.legacy.enabled set to true or extensions.allow-non-mpc-extensions set to true
- I cannot find a DevEdition asan build in <https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/artifacts/gecko.v2>
- the fuzzing build workaround is not working in this case
Is there another workaround in order to verify this issue on Fx 58?

Yes, I can verify that this is fixed on 58 as well.
In order to get the fuzzPriv extensions running on beta and release I use a fairly dirty hack to disable the signing and legacy checks. The following shell script does this:
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
unzip ../firefox/omni.ja
rm ./jsloader/resource/gre/modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm
sed -i -e 's/function mustSign(aType) [{]/ function mustSign(aType) {return false;/g' ./modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm
sed -i -e 's/function isDisabledLegacy(addon) [{]/function isDisabledLegacy(addon) {return false;/g' ./modules/addons/XPIProvider.jsm
rm ../firefox/omni.ja
zip -qr9XD ../firefox/omni.ja \*
cd ..Flags: needinfo?(nils)

A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in order for the access violation to occur.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Marcia Knous, Nathan Froyd, Oriol Brufau, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Ryan VanderMeulen, Sebastian Hengst, Karl Tomlinson, Xidorn Quan, Ludovic Hirlimann, and Jason Orendorff reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 57, Firefox ESR 52.5, and Thunderbird 52.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[crash.html (minimised testcase)](attachment.cgi?id=8927963)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8927963&action=edit)

The following testcase crashes the latest ASAN build of Firefox ESR 52.5.0 (SourceStamp=f9df5238dca13e40b8128faba317df25e2f69249). It requires the fuzzPriv extension and might need a few attempts to reproduce. Loading the testcase in multiple tabs at the same time helps with reproducibility.
crash.html:
<script>
function spin () {
var x=new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST","<https://mozilla.org>",false);
try{x.send("X");}catch(e){}
}
function start () {
o1=window.open('data:text/html,<div>','popup54','height=1');
window.top.setTimeout(fun0, 400);
}
function fun0() {
o1.onresize=fun1;
o1.resizeTo(10,-40961);
o1.resizeBy(1,-16);
}
var x=0;
function fun1() {
if(x++) return;
o1.close();
for(var x=0; x<10; x++) spin();

Looks like there's a nested event loop due to sync XHR. Docshell has a weak reference to mTreeOwner so maybe that's related.

Man, another case where MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT would save us if we had it annotated more...
nsWindow::DispatchResized is buggy, imo. It's doing:
if (mWidgetListener) {
mWidgetListener->WindowResized(this, mBounds.width, mBounds.height);
}
and under WindowResized we can land in code that first runs random script (and nulls out mWidgetListener), then tries to access "this".
We should hold a strong ref on the stack to mWidgetListener in nsWindow::DispatchResized, and consider adding some MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT around this stuff.

So far no luck reproducing.
But yes, based on stack traces we should either keep widget listener alive on the caller site, or
add kungfuDeathGrip

I managed to reproduce it for a few times with a debug asan build.
Is there a reason nsBaseWidget::mWidgetListener uses a raw pointer? Could we change it to nsCOMPtr?

Would that help? What if someone sets the mWidgetListener to null while handling the event?
(and I don't know why it is null. Would need to audit memory management around it)

Ah, because the nsIWidgetListener might be an nsView?
In that case, what we should probably do is move the nsIWidgetListener implementation off of nsWebShellWindow onto a separate object. That object would take a ref on the stack to the nsWebShellWindow before calling into it from WindowResized.

The original patch in [bug 743975](/show_bug.cgi?id=743975 "RESOLVED FIXED - View event handling cleanup") defined nsIWidgetListener::WindowRaised and
nsIWidgetListener::WindowLowered, but they were renamed to WindowActivated /
WindowDeactivated before landing according to [bug 743975 comment 69](/show_bug.cgi?id=743975#c69 "RESOLVED FIXED - View event handling cleanup"). The
implementation of nsWebBrowser was left with incorrect names.

Have you run this through try? I would expect that the caller needs to be annotated with either MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT or MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT\_BOUNDARY (and a followup filed to change it to MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT) to pass static analysis. Same for all the other MOZ\_CAN\_RUN\_SCRIPT bits.
r=me with that.

I assume I shouldn't push a sec-high patch to try server. I fixed it and run `./mach static-analysis check --checks="-\*, mozilla-can-run-script" toolkit xpfe` locally to verify. Hopefully I'm doing it right.

[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Just like other UAF bugs, the attacker needs to find a way to put the malicious code into proper memory region right after nsWebBrowser / nsWebShellWindow gets free'd.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
I don't think so, but the comment does mention that the new `nsIWidgetListener` implementations would hold strong references to `nsWebBrowser` & `nsWebShellWindow`.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All: 52 esr, 57, 58 beta.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Ever since nsIWidgetListener being introduced.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Not yet, but it should be easy.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
It's a relatively low risk, but it's always better to have more test cycles when touching widget related code.

Unfortunately I didn't managed to reproduce the issue mentioned in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1416878#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsWebShellWindow::WindowResized").
I tried reproducing this multiple times by loading the given testcase in multiple tabs and loading them at the same time.
I also tried (without success) reproducing this issue using an asan debug build (per [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1416878#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-use-after-free in nsWebShellWindow::WindowResized")).
Nils, can you help us verify if this issue was fixed?Flags: needinfo?(nils)
