    "information": "The provided documents contain information related to CVE-2018-5407, also known as PortSmash.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\n\n*   The root cause of this vulnerability is a side-channel leakage in Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) architectures, specifically due to contention in the ports to stacks of execution units.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n\n*   The core weakness is a timing side-channel vulnerability caused by shared resources in SMT architectures, specifically the contention on execution ports. This allows an attacker to leak sensitive information.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n\n*   Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack, which could potentially lead to the recovery of private keys (DSA or ECDSA), or other sensitive information from a process on the same physical core.\n\nAttack vectors:\n\n*   The primary attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have a process executing on the same physical core as the victim process (using SMT). The vulnerability could also be exploited remotely in scenarios where an attacker has access to a vulnerable remote process and uses specific network protocols (like HTTPS or TLS) to deliver and trigger an attack. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to run a process on the same physical core as the targeted process. This can be achieved through exploiting SMT architectures like Hyper-Threading, or by co-locating a malicious workload on the same physical core as a victim application.\n*   In some cases, an attacker may also require knowledge of the architecture and the specific instructions to effectively saturate the ports to generate a timing signal. Some attacks require an active network connection using specific protocol handshakes to elicit a response that can be measured by the attacker to recover private keys. \n\nAdditional details:\n\n*   The content provides detailed explanation of how the attack can be performed, leveraging timing variations due to port contention in SMT/Hyper-Threading environments, and how OpenSSL implementation of cryptographic algorithms (ECDSA, DSA) are vulnerable. Also, several specific fixes to OpenSSL, which mitigate the vulnerability (OpenSSL versions 1.0.2q, 1.1.0j, and 1.1.1a) are mentioned. The vulnerability was identified and demonstrated by researchers. The content also covers mitigations such as disabling Hyper-Threading, and coding practices that mitigate the risk of this vulnerability (e.g. constant-time algorithms)."
