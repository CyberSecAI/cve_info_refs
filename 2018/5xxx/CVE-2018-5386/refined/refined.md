Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-5386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an authentication bypass due to improper handling of authentication and access control in the Navarino Infinity web interface. Specific URLs could be crafted to bypass authentication mechanisms, allowing access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that specific functions, when placed within the URL, circumvent the intended authentication process, leading to an information leak. The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate user roles before executing the requested function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access sensitive information without proper authorization. The exact nature of the sensitive information is not detailed, but the article mentions sensitive data is returned.
*   **Potential Administrative Actions**: The CERT advisory suggests that a remote, unauthenticated attacker could bypass authentication and perform some administrative functions, though the article does not provide detail on what those actions would be.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker can bypass authentication by manipulating the URL, specifically by changing the "class" part of the URL while keeping the "function" name as "authenticate" or "validateAuthentication".
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be performed without prior authentication to the system, and it appears to be exposed to anyone with access to the system's interface over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Navarino Infinity web interface. The article mentions that the interface was accessible over the internet, but the default root was a 404 page.
*   **Basic Understanding of URL Structure**:  The attacker only needs a basic understanding of how the Navarino URL structure functions and the vulnerable authentication paths.

**Additional details from the Medium article:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered while performing a penetration test on a maritime company.
*   The article provides example URLs that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
    * `/index.php/logs/authenticate/`
    * `/index.php/admin/validateAuthentication/`
    * `/index.php/foo/authenticate/`
    * `/index.php/users/validateAuthentication/`
*   The article also mentions that if a non-existent class is used in the URL, the main function of the main class is executed showing a map of areas of interest, without showing any vessels.
*   Any subsequent AJAX requests made by the page would still fail requiring authentication.
*   The vendor issued a hotfix within 30 days of the report.
