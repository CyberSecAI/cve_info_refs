{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2018-5382",
    "description": "Bouncy Castle BKS version 1 keystore files use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS-V1 keystore.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Bouncy Castle BKS-V1 Keystore files"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The BKS version 1 keystore files use an HMAC with a 16-bit key size, while the hash algorithm used is SHA-1 which is 160 bits in length, leading to trivial hash collisions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak HMAC key size",
        "Insufficient Integrity protection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can compromise the integrity of a BKS-V1 keystore file and may bypass the integrity check by bruteforcing the key.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Brute-force attack against the 16-bit MAC key",
       "Offline attack"
        ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to a BKS version 1 keystore file and the capability to perform a brute-force attack.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists in BKS version 1.  Version 2 and above of the BKS keystore use a 160 bit MAC.  Applications using Bouncy Castle 1.49 or later may be affected if they explicitly request the use of the BKS-V1 keystore format."
