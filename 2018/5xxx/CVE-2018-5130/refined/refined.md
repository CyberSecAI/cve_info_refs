Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-5130:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper handling of mismatched RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) payload types in WebRTC connections within Firefox.
*   Specifically, when Firefox receives RTP packets with a payload type that does not match the expected type for the ongoing WebRTC session, it can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Payload Type Handling**: Firefox does not sufficiently validate or handle cases where the RTP payload type in incoming packets does not align with what was negotiated or expected by WebRTC sessions.
*   **Memory Corruption**: This lack of proper handling leads to a memory corruption when decoding the audio data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The mismatched payload type can cause a potentially exploitable crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution**: Though not explicitly confirmed in the provided documents, the nature of the memory corruption suggests the possibility of exploitation to achieve arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebRTC Connections:** The vulnerability can be triggered via manipulated RTP packets sent over a WebRTC connection.
*  **Malicious Remote Endpoint**: A malicious remote endpoint can send packets with an incorrect RTP payload type.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send RTP Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to participate in a WebRTC session and send crafted RTP packets to the vulnerable Firefox client.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a victim via WebRTC.
* **No user interaction required**: The vulnerability is automatically triggered by the processing of manipulated RTP packets.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox versions before 59 and ESR before 52.7.
* The vulnerability is present in the core WebRTC implementation.
* It is triggered in some circumstances when receiving audio data with a mismatched payload type during WebRTC connections, leading to memory corruption.
* The fix focuses on proper handling of the mismatched RTP payload type.
