# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

* Firefox ESR 52.7

#### [#CVE-2018-5127: Buffer overflow manipulating SVG animatedPathSegList](#CVE-2018-5127)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A buffer overflow can occur when manipulating the SVG `animatedPathSegList` through script. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1430557](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1430557)

#### [#CVE-2018-5129: Out-of-bounds write with malformed IPC messages](#CVE-2018-5129)

Reporter
James Grant
Impact
high
##### Description

A lack of parameter validation on IPC messages results in a potential out-of-bounds write through malformed IPC messages. This can potentially allow for sandbox escape through memory corruption in the parent process.

##### References

* [Bug 1428947](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947)

#### [#CVE-2018-5130: Mismatched RTP payload type can trigger memory corruption](#CVE-2018-5130)

Reporter
Tony Paloma
Impact
high
##### Description

When packets with a mismatched RTP payload type are sent in WebRTC connections, in some circumstances a potentially exploitable crash is triggered.

##### References

* [Bug 1433005](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433005)

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Olli Pettay, Christian Holler, Nils Ohlmeier, Randell Jesup, Tyson Smith, Ralph Giles, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Received a vuln report via email from a friend. I've not confirmed (on paternity leave) but someone should check this. Bug sounds hard to exploit, but reporter want to check with us before blogging about it just in case.
--VIA EMAIL BELOW ------
In the process of creating a full writeup / exploit for the Pwn2Own 2017 bug (<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2017-08/>) I believe have come across another bug. I am unsure whether the Chaitin team who discovered the Integer Overflow overlooked the vulnerable code, chose to ignore it, reported it alongside their Integer Overflow, or someone else found it subsequently and reported it but I haven't yet found any indication of this being the case.
What's the bug?
The vulnerable function is `CopyPlane` within ImageContainer.cpp (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/layers/ImageContainer.cpp#539>). The issue here is that the signed 32-bit integer `width` used in the 'Slow Path' of the copy (or when aSkip is anything other than 0) is unchecked. This means that in the case of Firefox 52 a specially crafted Layout can achieve a very simple out of bounds write purely by setting the width value of a layout object to more than the calculated height. (Inside the poc.zip folder I have provided the oobwrite.html file for a simple demonstration of what i mean).
What's the impact?
After a bit of research and scouring through the current Firefox source, I have come to the conclusion that it is \_very\_ difficult to actually trigger this vulnerable function however it is not impossible. The function `CopyPlane` is referenced only within the `RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData`. The `CopyData` function is then referenced 9 times outside of ImageContainer however, 1 is mitigated by the fact that you removed the overloaded constructor for ImageBitmap objects in Firefox 52. I haven't had a chance to go through and attempt to trigger the bug via the remaining 8 references but i have the suspicion it could be very difficult to trigger from any other code path. For this reason i understand the impact is low but i think it is definitely worth looking at!
I have actually included this out of bounds write within my writeup but - because I realised the bug may not have been reported / discovered prior to now i thought it would be best to let you know and make sure it got fixed or marked as wont-fix before i go and publish the details publicly.

So note that while the PoC requires imagebitmap\_extensions enabled, the vulnerable function exists in FF for a long time, is just hard to hit. So that's really the question here: can you trigger this exploit this using some other way?

Thanks Paul & friend.
I had a quick look at the path going through MediaData.cpp, and that one seemed possibly safe thanks to the validation at:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/MediaData.cpp#308>
But this should be verified, and there are other paths using CopyPlane.
Blake, could you (or someone on the media team) please have a look?Flags: needinfo?(bwu)

Note that these checks only check overflow - it doesn't validate that the width is actually the size of the buffer.

For reference for ever is joining this thread the issue is here:

If width isn't what we expect, we write out of bounds.

Hey all,
I have taken a look at the ValidateBufferAndPicture in terms of validating / preventing the bug and have realised that it only prevents the following situations:
1. the Planes (destination buffers) from becoming out of sync for whatever reason, maybe a realloc or an accidental free or something unexpected. (117-123)
2. the width and height becoming negative (good check to have) or being zero. (126-130)
3. the `ValidatePlane` function then ensures that the width and height are less than 16384 AND the width \* height is less than 8192 \* 4608 AND that the stride is > 0. (131-136)
4. the xLimit & yLimit for the aPicture do not have any sort of Integer Overflow / Underflow in their width or height compared to their value (Im assuming to prevent one from referencing out of bound pixels or whatever when rendering) (138-148)
Based on those 4, it is still possible that the height can be set to 1/4 of the width (for example). Then, because the Plane ( destination buffer ) is allocated based on the calculation: mData.mCbCrStride \* mData.mCbCrSize.height \* 2 + mData.mYStride \* mData.mYSize.height, the width can just be 2 \* the height and it will iterate past the end of the destination buffer.
I think it might be good to mention also that the vulnerable function is also called from within ChromiumCDMParent. Firstly the IPC function RecvDecodedData (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/gmp/ChromiumCDMParent.cpp#686>) takes the untrusted input and passes it to CreateVideoFrame (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/gmp/ChromiumCDMParent.cpp#783>) which will then pass the untrusted data down the line to our CopyData / CopyPlane allowing us to crash the Parent GMP process / escape the sandbox.

Unfortunately, ValidateBufferAndPicture() can only guarantee the region to copy (aPicture) lies within the source buffer (aBuffer) by checking the plane info because the actual source buffer length is not available in the YCbCrBuffer structure. Unless that information is provided, the caller should be responsible for the correctness of plane info.
Currently there are 8 callers to VideoData::CreateAndCopyData() that fills the info. All seems fine, and no validation is done in any of them. AFAICT, only ChromiumCDMParent::CreateVideoFrame() is able to do it for others receive raw pointers and cannot get the buffer length.

bzdllx, could you please elaborate? I don't quite get your concern here. The destination buffer length is Y plane length + Cb + Cr where each plane is stride \* height bytes long. It has nothing to do with the propotion of width to height.

It seems 2 layers of protections are needed:
1. Examine the info inside aData before buffer allocation in RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage::CopyData() to make sure it's safe to copy image data.
2. (For Paul's PoC) check the plane layout and reject invalid ImageBitmap creation.

Sure! So my main concern is actually highlighted by your comment - "It has nothing to do with the proportion of width to height." The issue I see here is actually best viewed from a 'How would I fix it' standpoint. Currently, the destination buffer is calculated with the Stride and Height from the Cb / Cr / Y Layout objects. However, when it comes to the vulnerable 'Slow path' within the `CopyPlane` function, the nested for-loop copy is based on `width \* height`, not `height \* stride`. So the 'fixed' approach to the 'Slow Path' copy would either be to copy based on `height \* stride` or, when allocating the buffer in `CopyData`, somehow integrate the width property in the equation so the size is calculated based on that instead of the stride.
As an example of what i mean - If you take a look at the PoC Paul attached (crashes in FF52), you will see that the uLayout.width property is actually double the size of the yLayout.height property. If we do the maths for the destination buffer allocation with the numbers included in my PoC the resulting destination buffer is allocated as follows:
= 1 \* 1 \* 2 + 1024 \* 1
= 1026 bytes
Then, if we use the current 'Slow Path' copy of that `CopyPlane` function with our uLayout.width property set to 2048. We will enter the top for-loop with a height of 1 and then iterate our width 2048 times, allowing us to overrun the 1026 destination buffer.
In terms of a trigger / crashing the latest version of Firefox, a specially crafted video file would definitely be able to trigger the aforementioned vulnerable 'Slow Copy' code. Would take a fair amount of effort however it would by no means be impossible.

Agreed. I think we should take the 2nd approach for it also saves some memory when the source buffer has padding (strike > width), or is semi-planar (stride >= 2 \* width) or interleaved (stride >= 3 \* width)
BTW, it seems there are other problems in CopyData():
- mData is modified [1] even when copy fails
- incorrect mData.\*Skip values. (Should all be 0 because destination buffer is planar)

Hi John,
I've reviewed the patch you've created and only have one question - I noticed that on lines 587 & 591 you have set the Stride for `mY` and `mCbCr` equal to the width before passing them to `CopyPlane`. `CopyPlane` then performs the 'Slow' copy the same as before however now, the `aDst` buffer is using `+=width` instead of `+=stride`. Is there a reason why you couldn't keep the original `+=stride` for the `aDst` buffer as well seeing as you are setting the Stride equal to the width prior to the function call anyway? I'm asking purely to better my understanding :)
I will make the changes in my build of FF52 and test them to make sure I can't write OOB!
Thanks.

aStride in CopyPlane() is the stride of source (aData.m\*Stride in CopyData()); Before calling CopyPlane() it’s the destination plane strides (mData.m\*Stride) which were modified.
Maybe we could rename aData to aSource, or change CopyPlane() parameters to include both source and destination strides like libyuv::CopyPlane(), to make it easier to read.

Hey all,
I have applied the patch created by John and tested it against FF52. I know you guys have your own testing process but i used the 'oobwrite.html' file to count the number of crashes / 50 runs on both an unpatched and patched version.
Results:
- The unpatched version resulted in 36 crashes and 14 without.
- The patched version resulted in 50 without. (Woo!)
I will double check every path here to be absolutely certain but i think the ability to write OOB has been removed with the changes.
Not sure who the new owner will be but it looks like you guys just need to test and then merge in :)

I'm concerned about the lack of movement on this bug. I know we have a difficult situation on our hands - but [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") worries me - as far as I can tell, the comment is correct. IIUC, we take data from IPC in ChromiumCDMParent::RecvDecodedShmem, pass it to VideoData::CreateAndCopyData which calls the vulnerable Copydata/Copyplace.
Corrent me if I'm wrong here, but this would appear to be a serious sandbox escape (especially if it can be used to escape the GMP process which would seem likely).

No, sorry for confusing things. As far as I can tell, the patch here does seem to fix the underlying issue here. My understanding of the state of the bug is that the patch needs to be reviewed, to make sure that it does actually fix the issue, and that this is the best place to add validation etc.
I was only commenting on the criticality in [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") as to me this seems like a bug which is both web exploitable (via a maliciously crafted video) and also one could lead to code execution in the parent (based on looking at the code path in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp")).

I reviewed the code and the changes made by :jhlin should fix the OOB memory write in CopyPlanes. I looked at the code path via the CDM and the parameters are validated, although I believe it's possible to craft an IPDL message that causes an OOB memory read, since the image parameters aren't checked against the size of aData received in `ChromiumCDMParent::RecvDecodedData()`.
What I can't comment on is that :jhlin changed an assumption of `RecyclingPlanarYCbCrImage`, so I'm going to NI? :mattwoodrow to get an answer on whether it is OK that Y, Cb, Cr image planes have mWidth = mStride.

I believe the original description is invalid and in particular a way to reproduce it.
It is not possible to generate a YCbCrImage using a specially crafted layout: the code path to access libyuv is never reached.
The only producers of YCbCrImage objects are media decoders, and of those decoders only the VPXDecoder, FFmpegVideoDecoder and TheoraDecoder can produce such objects.
Why this is important, is that it's not possible for a decoder to produce an image whose width is big enough that it would generate an overflow later.
When we demux webm (vp8/vp9) and Theora (ogg) media content, the validity of such content is checked by the demuxer using:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/VideoUtils.cpp#176>
the value of PlanarYCbCrImage::MAX\_DIMENSIONS is set <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/layers/ImageContainer.h#825>
that's 16384 pixels wide
Other decoders use:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/MediaData.cpp#106>
which checks that neither the width nor the height would be greater than 16384 pixels wide.
This bug is non-existent as such, and we would be attempting to fix a problem that doesn't exist at the expense of slowing down everything else.
In a YCbCrImage a stride typically is 16 bytes aligned due to the hardware code that generated it, and libyuv makes use of SSE accelerated code when the stride have such alignment.
If we made the stride == width, libyuv would then have to use a slow C code path.
When playing a 60fps video, slowing down what is already a heavy process will have a great impact.
I would close this bug as invalid

then fix createImageBitmap to prevent creating such images... It would be a one-liner.

It seems like the fundamental issue here is that stride < width. The stride is the number of bytes per row, and should always be greater or equal than the width \* bytes-per-pixel.
We're allocating the destination buffer based on stride (as you'd expect, we don't want to bother trying to compact things), and then copying all the valid bytes into it (using the width).
That seems like expected behaviour, unfortunately the PoC testcase is passing a completely garbage stride, and nobody bothers to check.
We should just add some validation for the untrusted callers (createImageBitmap, and ChromiumCDMParent::RecvDecodedShmem) to ensure that the stride actually covers all bytes of the width, and the extents of the planes are within the buffer provided.
We could run this validation unconditionally in debug builds, so that we'd catch broken decoders, and just run it for the untrusted callers in opt builds.Flags: needinfo?(matt.woodrow)

So why not check this? Is it too much of a performance cost? The basic issue here seems to be a difference in the allocation in CopyPlane vs the loop in CopyData. The size of the buffer is based on height and stride, and the loop in CopyData is based on height and width. I don't know enough about video formats to understand why there is a difference here, but the naive solution would seem to be to make the buffer allocation and the CopyData function use the same calculation(i.e. both take width into account, or neither).
But taking a step back: here we have a dangerous low-level function which has undocumented assumptions which has lead to a number of security issues. I'm struggling to understand why it's not better to fix this in the calling functions, rather than add check to the dangerous low-level function. Performance I guess, but I'm worried we haven't addressed all the issues. I'm pretty certain that the Sandboxing issue in ChromiumCDMParent needs to be fixed, but I'm unclear about other issues. Let me try to outline the issues that I see, so we can be sure we have resolved everything here.
1. createImageBitmap
This was the original PoC. I don't much care about this - its pref'd off, and known to be really broken. We should add the validation here I guess, but it's not a priority, since there is a lot more fixing that is needed before we would consider re-enabling this. (and as far as I know we don't plan to do this any time soon).
2. Video decoding leading to CopyPlane
So in [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp"), jya seems pretty sure that \_all\_ of the video decoding paths to this issue are safe due to validation. To be honest I'm not convinced - mainly because in [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") he is talking about checking the maximum size, and that's not the point of the bug. This is NOT an overflow bug - it's a data validation issue leading to out-of-bounds write. This is complex code and I trust his knowledge better than mine, but I'm not sure if we are doing the correct validation here. I'm looking more into this (I don't completely understand [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") yet).
3. The sandbox escape issue
ChromiumCDMParent seems to me to pretty clearly be a sandbox escape. An attacker who has compromised the GMP sandbox could send arbitrary IPC messages to ChromiumCDMParent::RecvDecodedData or ChromiumCDMParent::RecvDecodedShmem. (PS Matt, why did you only mention RecvDecodedShmem? Aren't both of these functions a concern? I also wonder if these IPC message can ONLY be called from GMP, or can a regular child process also invoke these IPC calls? Either way, we need some validation here to avoid the sandbox escape.
4. Other call sites
Is MediaEngineRemoteVideoSource::DeliverFrame[1] another call site? Are there others that we haven't discussed above? I haven't done an audit because I assumed we would fix the vulnerable function.
[1] <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/webrtc/MediaEngineRemoteVideoSource.cpp#553>
5. Correctness issues
At the end of [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp"), several correctness issues were highlighted. Are these valid issues that need fixing, or is [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") incorrect?
I think that's everything. IF we are going down the route of fix the callsites, then someone needs to an audit to make sure we have got all the callers. Personally I'd rather that we just fix the dangerous function (if possible).

My understanding was that libyuv::CopyPlane() uses row width, not stride, to choose copy routine [1]. And when the width is not SIMD aligned, it still makes use of SIMD accelerated code as much as it can, so only the end of the row will be copied using memcpy().

I think the behaviour of CopyPlane is what we want, so I'd aruge that it isn't broken.
We should definitely add a runtime assertion that detects that exploitable case (width > stride), so that we crash safely if it happens.
It's really up to the callers to detect it normally though, since only they know what the right rejection behaviour is.Flags: needinfo?(matt.woodrow)

Are you saying that [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") is wrong then? Or are you talking in a general sense?

Do you mean add a runtime assertion to release builds to crash safely in this case? Or to debug builds? Its not much use adding it to debug builds unless we are actually fuzzing to try to hit these cases.

For the general case, having stride and width specified separately lets us have each row start at an aligned address even for odd numbered widths. We don't want to allocate our destination based on the width, since it'll undo this alignment and potentially give worse performance.
The other bugs mentioned there seem valid, and in the case where copying is converting from interleaved to planar, we probably want to recompute the stride to be something sane for the destination format.

Right, I meant a release assertion as a last line of defense.

I'm in agreement with :mattwoodrow about the required behaviour for `CopyPlane`. I've added a MOZ\_ASSERT\_RELEASE to `CopyPlane` and add a check for `width < stride` in `MediaData::ValidatePlane`.
The problem with the `createImageBitmap` code is that there is \*no\* validation of the values in `ChannelPixelLayout` received from JS. Is this API supposed to be generally accessible? ie. Is it planned that the pref gate be removed?

Don't we want aData.mYSkip here (the skip for the source), since mData.mYSkip is always 0?

Check plane width & stride constraints. r=mattwoodrow
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
This bug, before patch, is dangerous if the imagebitmap extensions are
enabled, but that requires a pref to be enabled by a user.
The other code paths to CopyPlane are protected by check
MediaData::ValidatePlane, which was tighted to assert width < stride. To
exploit this would require video decoders to return incorrect values,
which is unlikely, or crafting an incorrect IPDL message from CDM.
:mattwoodrow suggest this patch could be re-classified as sec-low
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
The comment hints at an issue with width & stride but it's not obvious how
to trigger the behaviour.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
57, 58, 59, 60
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
No, but the code affected code hasn't changed since 2012.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Low, the code is tested by the existing media/video mochitests.

I don't think this is sec-low. It might not be sec-critical - as I said above, I was changing the criticality because it looked exploitable from the web, even without imagebitmap. I'm not sure if this bug was exploitable or not via video or webrtc paths (at least [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp") doesn't convince me it safe). But even assuming this bug was ONLY exploitable via a malformed IPC message, we typically rate these sorts of sandbox escape bugs sec-high, and this one being exploitable from the CDM is rare (and hence more valuable to an attacker).
My gut feel here is bug is probably only sec-high, due to the sandbox escape, and the difficulty of exploitation via video paths (if thats even possible). At the end of the day it doesn't really matter. Its clearly a bug and we have a fix available.

You're right, 52 is affected. Why does 58 get a "won't fix"?

Because we already shipped 58 and lack a time machine.
sec-approval+ for trunk (60). Please nominate a patch for beta (59) as well.
I'm not sure this is a sec-critical really if this is disabled by a pref by default for users but I'll give the sec-approval anyway.

I'm confused. The devs here says that it isn't exploitable if canvas.imagebitmap\_extensions.enabled isn't set and that is not set by default for users. How would this be a sec-critical then?

Well, it matters for things like advisories and bounties. We don't award bounties on sec-low bugs and we don't write advisories for things that are disabled by default.
I'd love a definitive answer from the devs since we're shipping Firefox 59 in a week and I have to figure out if this bug is rated correctly and if it needs a security advisory or not.Flags: needinfo?(dglastonbury)

Because the vulnerable code in question, highlighted in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp"), is reachable by many code paths. The 4 main ones are:
- The createImageBitmap thing, which we dont really care about
- Via a malformed video (but jya thinks this is actually impossible but I didnt know that when I rated it)
- possibly via webrtc (I dont think this was inviestigated but the fix will fix this case if it was vulnerable)
- via a malformed IPC message from the GMP sandbox (requires an additional exploit to get code exec in sandbox first)
ONLY the last one has been confirmed to be an issue. I'll be honest, I'm not convinced that \_all\_ other paths are safe, but it doesn't really matter, its easier just to fix it.

Only from code review. The only one Im sure about is the sandbox escape But it IS clear that this function is unsafe, and the only comment which address this is [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428947#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - OOB Write in CopyPlane within ImageContainer.cpp"), but that seem to miss the point of the vulnerability.

The pref only affect the createImageBitmap vector. The sandbox escape is valid regardless.

The sandbox escape is definitely valid. jya thinks the video path is not exploitable and In not sure anyone looked at the webrtc path. So assuming there ISNT a web exploitable vector here (we dont have proof of one in any case), I would suggest that you rate this bug based on the sandbox escape, which I think is the main issue here.

PS Al if you need a description for advisory, I'd suggest:
A lack of parameter validation on IPC messages results in a potential out-of-bounds write. This could potentially allow for sandbox escape via memory corruption in the parent process.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1433005#c0)• 7 years ago |
|  | |

We discovered by accident that if from our remote WebRTC endpoint we send RTP packets with a correct SSRC and body but an incorrect PayloadType we can crash Firefox and cause invalid read/write or divide by zero exceptions.
The details of what we are sending are RTP packets with contents originally generated by a client using Chrome with opus/48000/2 contents, but the payload type from Chrome is 111 and we were inadvertently putting that into the payload type for the packet forwarded to Firefox rather than 109 as Firefox desired via the negotiated SDP for it. The Firefox client receiving the packet seemed to consider it valid, about:webrtc showed packets being received and no errors, various WebRTC logging in Firefox also looked happy, but fairly quickly we’d crash with one of the below presumably because the audio decoding was invalid due to incorrect payload type.
Once we fixed our server code forwarding these packets to set correct payload types all the crashes stopped, but this appears to be a remotely exploitable crash bug at the least with possible remote code execution potential if packets were carefully crafted and targeted? So just in case, I've marked this as a security bug.

This is all stuff in the media stack. We could maybe add some filtering logic in MediaPipeline that will strip out bad packets, but the fact that the media stack screws up the memory management when the payload type is wrong suggests that there are probably similar memory management bugs that will be triggered by bad payloads, which is something we can't check in MediaPipeline...Flags: needinfo?(docfaraday)

We've fuzzed some video stuff, but this is audio data... probably we should fuzz audio inputs (feed in "Opus" data (and other codecs!) with fuzzed data (wrong/wrong-length/right-header-wrong-rest, etc). Most of these appear to be in NetEq, which is after the codecs; it would be interesting to see what the codecs are decoding to or if failure/sanity (output length) checks are missing somewhere.
Also check upstream for neteq fixes.Flags: needinfo?(cdiehl)

Yeah I was also thinking about checking for the PT type. But I don't get why the PT actually matters after the transport layer. So I would like to replicate to find out the root cause, rather then plastering over it.Flags: needinfo?(drno)

Actually, we're on [Bug 1341285](/show_bug.cgi?id=1341285 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update WebRTC code to webrtc.org stable branch 57"): Webrtc updated to branch 57 rev 52b6562a10b495; initial pull made Feb 2 2017 14:38 EST
They switched off SVN some time ago, so that file is no longer relevant.

Those may still be relevant, however. We can cherrypick if needed/useful.

Attached patch

[Don't insert DTMF codec twice](attachment.cgi?id=8945831&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8945831&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1433005&attachment=8945831)

The problem was that we only had the DTMF codec present in the codecs array, so we would attempt to insert a second copy of it past the end of the array, and then resize the array to accommodate it. This moves the resize so that we are guaranteed to have enough space for any extra codecs we're adding. It also adds a check that prevents us from adding a second copy of the DTMF codec, as that leads to a use-after-free soon after.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is getting hard to read. My suggestion is to:
1. Find each entry we want to use (the actual codec, the dtmf, the red, and anything else), and remove it from the codec array.
2. Empty out the codec array, deleting anything that is left.
3. Build a new codec array.

Does this mean that we should iterate through the array and take the first codec that is not dtmf or ulpfec as our preferred codec? Shouldn't the sort done at [1] make sure that the preferred codec is sorted ahead of dtmf or ulpfec? If not, should we fix the sort?

We are now keeping ulpfec as well as dtmf?
It might be safer to just fix the crash here and make any behavioural changes in a non-sec bug where things are easier to test.

That sort only causes "strongly preferred" codecs to override the preference indicated by the remote end. Unless prefs are set, there are no "strongly preferred" codecs. (<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/062e1cf551f5bf3f0af33671b818f75a55ac497b/media/webrtc/signaling/src/jsep/JsepTrack.cpp#388>) So, you'll need to iterate.

It is easier to reason about this code's memory safety if we cover all the bases.

I wonder if webrtc.org is gonna barf if this isn't first? Should check this, or put it at the front using insert.

Simplify codec pruning in NegotiateCodecs
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Since the patch looks like a refactor, I don't think the underlying problem it fixes is that obvious.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
No.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All, the code was introduced in [Bug 1291714](/show_bug.cgi?id=1291714 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add signaling support for DTMF in WebRTC").
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
I believe the same patch will apply to all branches. If not, the changes required should be minimal.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Unlikely, I would expect our standard unit tests to catch any problems.

Attached patch

[Fix up JsepSessionTest::ValidateAnsweredCodecParams gtest](attachment.cgi?id=8946708&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8946708&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1433005&attachment=8946708)

I forgot to run the gtests before landing this. We're now keeping the ulpfec codec which breaks some of the tests in JsepSessionTest::ValidateAnsweredCodecParams. This looks like expected changes to me, but I wanted to double check just to be safe. Assuming this is fine, I'll roll this up into the main patch when I reland.

Randell, I'm guessing we shouldn't retain the ulpfec codec here until we enable ulpfec support over in [Bug 875922](/show_bug.cgi?id=875922 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Firefox support for ulpfec/red in WebRTC video channels is not enabled")?Flags: needinfo?(dminor) → needinfo?(rjesup)

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as `about:debugging`, if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open.

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

#### [#CVE-2018-5135: WebExtension browserAction can inject scripts into unintended contexts](#CVE-2018-5135)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use `browser.tabs.executeScript` to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged `about:` pages.

#### [#CVE-2018-5137: Script content can access legacy extension non-contentaccessible resources](#CVE-2018-5137)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Reporter
rugk
Impact
low
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

#### [#CVE-2018-5142: Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2018-5142)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown protocol" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Sebastian Hengst, Jason Kratzer, Tyson Smith, Ryan VanderMeulen, Noemi Erli, Karl Tomlinson, Philipp, Gary Kwong, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201810-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **60.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **60.2.2** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-60.2.2"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-60.2.2"

```

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
