{
  "CVE-2018-5683": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the vga_draw_text routine of the QEMU emulator. By writing to the VGA CRT controller registers, a guest user can modify the display memory address, potentially causing a read from an address out of the VGA RAM range, leading to a segmentation fault and denial of service.",
    "affected_component": "QEMU VGA emulator",
    "root_cause": "Lack of validation of memory addresses when writing to VGA CRT controller registers, particularly index 0x0C and 0x0D (start address registers). This allows a guest user to modify the display memory address to an invalid location.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Missing memory address validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged user inside a guest can trigger a segmentation fault in the QEMU process, leading to a denial of service of the virtual machine.",
    "attack_vector": "A privileged user (guest OS) can write to VGA CRT controller registers.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a privileged account within the guest operating system to execute the code that modifies the VGA registers.",
    "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by writing random values to the VGA CRT controller registers.",
        "The vulnerability was fixed by adding validation for memory addresses before reading from or writing to them.",
        "The issue was originally reported by Jiang Xin and Lin ZheCheng.",
        "The fix was part of a larger security update which also addressed issues like Spectre v2 mitigations."
