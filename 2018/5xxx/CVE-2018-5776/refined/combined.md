# WordPress 4.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 4.9.2 is now available. This is a **security and maintenance release** for all versions since WordPress 3.7﻿. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the Flash fallback files in MediaElement, a library that is included with WordPress. Because the Flash files are no longer needed for most use cases, they have been removed from WordPress.

MediaElement has released a new version that contains a fix for the bug, and [a WordPress plugin containing the fixed files](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mediaelement-flash-fallbacks/) is available in the plugin repository.

Thank you to the reporters of this issue for practicing [responsible security disclosure](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/): [Enguerran Gillier](https://opnsec.com) and [Widiz﻿](https://widiz.com/).

21 other bugs were fixed in WordPress 4.9.2. Particularly of note were:

* JavaScript errors that prevented saving posts in Firefox have been fixed.
* The previous taxonomy-agnostic behavior of `get_category_link()` and `category_description()` was restored.
* Switching themes will now attempt to restore previous widget assignments, even when there are no sidebars to map.

The Codex has [more information about all of the issues fixed in 4.9.2](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.9.2), if you'd like to learn more.

﻿[Download WordPress 4.9.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and click "Update Now." Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update automatically.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 4.9.2:
