| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

[csp\_bypass\_require\_chromeurl.html](attachment.cgi?id=8945158)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Build ID: 20180122220231
Steps to reproduce:
This bug exists in Firefox's legacy extension system. The legacy extension is still used in the browser internally.
Usually, only if the extension's resources are defined on `chrome.manifest` and it has a `contentaccessible=yes` flag, the defined resources can be loaded from web pages via <script> tag or other tags. However, by using crafted path string, even non-contentaccessible resources can be loaded from web pages. Due to this bug, as I described in [bug 1432358](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432358 "VERIFIED FIXED - Universal CSP strict-dynamic bypass via require.js of browser resource"), it causes an universal bypass of CSP strict-dynamic via chrome:// URL. I attached PoC again.
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See `chrome.manifest` file of browser internal resources from the following URL (in case of Windows):
jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/chrome.manifest
2. Find this line:
content browser browser/content/browser/ contentaccessible=yes
This means that any web pages can load the resources placed on jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/browser/content/browser/\* via chrome://browser/content/\* URLs.
3. The resources placed on jar:file:///C:/Program%20Files/Nightly/browser/omni.ja!/chrome/devtools/\* do not have a contentaccessible flag. So, usually it should not be loaded from web pages.
However, using the following crafted URL, it can be loaded from web pages:
(Please take notice to the two slashes of "content//chrome". )
chrome://browser/content//chrome/devtools/modules/devtools/client/jsonview/lib/require.js
It seems that the following path format causes this issue:
chrome:// [ACCESSIBLE\_PATH] // [NON\_ACCESSIBLE\_PATH]

Basically this means all of omni.ja (and all of any jar file with any contentaccessible content, afaict) is contentaccessible=yes. That's not great. :-(Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

Bobby, is this a crazy idea? It seems to work in my testing. Not sure how terrible this is for performance and/or if we should pursue something else or there's a simpler way to accomplish this.

Tentative patch
So the fundamental problem is that we're doing this:
NS\_NewURI(aResult, path, nullptr, baseURI)
where "path" is something that starts with '/', right?
I wonder whether we could even have "path" start with something like "file://whatever" and get somewhere that way... That is, is there an actual guarantee that baseURI and resultingURI have the same scheme here?
I also wonder how ".." bits in the relative path would work.
I guess this approach of checking the full spec or jar path mostly handles all those cases in the situations when the baseURI is jar: or file:, which is good. But we should probably also fail out for any case in which baseURI and resultingURI have different schemes, even if baseURI's scheme is something other than "jar" or "file".
We should check what happens with ".." in the file:// case. Does that get canonicalized or preserved? If the latter, then we can have the substring thing testing true but still be walking all over the disk...
I did check, and nsIURI.resolve would \_not\_ help us out here. So this seems like the sanest approach barring a better necko API around this stuff or changes to how we represent these URLs.

I don't know of any way to change the scheme of a URI when the path is relative, unless you include a protocol in `path`, which we guard for at the link below.
> I also wonder how ".." bits in the relative path would work.
Not obvious from this diff, but those should be being caught here, right: <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/474d58c9137360c0fa1c85cdd11e3313b33b7cad/chrome/nsChromeRegistry.cpp#234-258> ?
I considered adding stuff there, but I decided I didn't want to risk missing some bizarre escape sequence that would still end up with a relative path starting with '/', given that leading whitespace is just getting ignored (and, presumably, ditto for things like leading close-to-0 bytes, given the URL parsing spec...).
Would you prefer if I tried to add stuff to Canonify? Because relative paths must be allowed (ie chrome://browser/content/foo/bar/baz.xul should still work) just outlawing '/' the way we outlaw ':' won't work. I did consider restricting the path component to something like [a-zA-Z0-9#\_-] but figured that might still break things. Particularly query strings. And once you get URI escaping for query strings / hashes, restricting the unescaped version to that set is harder, and might break things again. Perhaps I'm too pessimistic about that... Anyway, I'd given up on that avenue, but perhaps that was premature or there was an easy fix I was missing...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Mostly asking because I'm somewhat nervous about the perf implication of running all these resolve() calls and full string/spec comparisons for any attempt to use chrome URIs. :-(
I'd push to try but this is a sec bug, and anyway I'm not sure how to easily check the perf implications here.

chrome://browser/content/file:///etc/passwd
or so is what I meant here. As you note, nsChromeRegistry::Canonify already handles this.
I have to admit that it seems to me like checking for leading whitespace or leading '/' in canonify and bailing out if found should fix this, possibly at lower perf cost. But as you note with a bit more room for error...Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

One option is to land the string comparison for now and then at more leisure investigate beefing up Canonify and removing the string compare.

Hm. I guess we could just require the first character of the path to be [a-zA-Z0-9]. That'd break this attack, including any whitespace variants, and be a lot cheaper. Unless I'm missing something? :-)

That seems like an \_excellent\_ mitigation. In practice, I assume we can require it to be [a-zA-Z], even, no? Or even [a-z].

It seems we have non-test files that start with numbers (several dozen in browser/ alone). I don't know if any of them get packaged in the root of any chrome packages but I decided I didn't want to take the risk (and the potential confusion in the future if people tried to use such names).

I think this would be a lot clearer like so:

!('A' <= \*pos && \*pos <= 'Z') &&
!('0' <= \*pos && \*pos <= '9')) {
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_BAD\_URI;
}
or so. Thoughts?

Oh, of course. That works. I just never think of things like this because my brain is too JS-wired. No char-to-int conversion, you only get "0".charCodeAt(0) and that \* 6 is just yucky.

Patch v2
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: n/a
[User impact if declined]: security issue
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: There are existing automated tests. I didn't add any because it's a security fix and that'd reveal what the specific issue is. Also because it's reasonably trivial to test manually. I'll file a follow-up to add automated tests specifically for this issue.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: not yet, will land on central later today.
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: yes:
1. open browser
2. try loading these URLs:
chrome://browser/content//
chrome://browser/content/ /
(lots of spaces)
They should load the default search engine or an error page, as opposed to a file listing (pre-patch)
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none.
[Is the change risky?]: no
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: simple checks that limit chrome URI syntax to avoid this issue, which is a safe change to make because we no longer have to deal with external add-ons, and because in-product consumers would never use these URIs.

Calling ESR52 wontfix since it's rated sec-moderate, but feel free to set the status to affected and nominate it for approval if you feel strongly that it should be considered anyway.

Patch v2
Let's uplift this for 59 beta 7, sounds reasonable and doesn't seem like it will break anything (famous last words)

I managed to reproduce the issue with the steps from [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432870#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Path traversal on chrome:// URLs") on Windows 10 x64 using an older version of Nightly (2018-01-24).
I retested everything on latest Nightly 60.0a1 and beta 59.0b7 on Windows 10 x 64, Ubuntu 16.04 x64 and macOS 10.13 and the issue is not reproducing anymore. Every time the default search engine page is loaded.
I did find an issue though. If I try to open the page with the command "Paste & Go", the page never loads and in the Network Monitor there are no request displayed.

Please file a separate bug for this that is not security sensitive. Do not link to this bug in any way. As a test-case for that bug, use "chrome://browser/content/../../", which shows the same behaviour even before this patch.
I assume otherwise this bug can be marked verified?Flags: needinfo?(oana.botisan)

# USN-3596-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

14 March 2018

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application

crash or opening new tabs, escape the sandbox, bypass same-origin

restrictions, obtain sensitive information, confuse the user with

misleading permission requests, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5125](/security/CVE-2018-5125),

[CVE-2018-5126](/security/CVE-2018-5126), [CVE-2018-5127](/security/CVE-2018-5127), [CVE-2018-5128](/security/CVE-2018-5128), [CVE-2018-5129](/security/CVE-2018-5129), [CVE-2018-5130](/security/CVE-2018-5130),

[CVE-2018-5136](/security/CVE-2018-5136), [CVE-2018-5137](/security/CVE-2018-5137), [CVE-2018-5140](/security/CVE-2018-5140), [CVE-2018-5141](/security/CVE-2018-5141), [CVE-2018-5142](/security/CVE-2018-5142))

It was discovered that the fetch() API could incorrectly return cached

copies of no-store/no-cache resources in some circumstances. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information in

environments where multiple users share a common profile. ([CVE-2018-5131](/security/CVE-2018-5131))

Multiple security issues were discovered with WebExtensions. If a user

were tricked in to installing a specially crafted extension, an attacker

could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information or bypass

security restrictions. ([CVE-2018-5132](/security/CVE-2018-5132), [CVE-2018-5134](/security/CVE-2018-5134), [CVE-2018-5135](/security/CVE-2018-5135))

It was discovered that the value of app.support.baseURL is not sanitized

properly. If a malicious local application were to set this to a specially

crafted value, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5133](/security/CVE-2018-5133))

It was discovered that javascript: URLs with embedded tab characters could

be pasted in to the addressbar. If a user were tricked in to copying a

specially crafted URL in to the addressbar, an attacker could exploit this

to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2018-5143](/security/CVE-2018-5143))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to <http://test.shhnjk.com/2.html>
2. Click on open another window button.
3. Click on stop button on one tab
Actual results:
Both tabs stopped counting (SharedWorker established cross-origin).
Expected results:
In <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#sharedworker>, step 11.2's note of "When the SharedWorker(scriptURL, options) constructor is invoked:" says
data: URLs create a worker with an opaque origin. Both the constructor origin and constructor url are compared so the same data: URL can be used within an origin to get to the same SharedWorkerGlobalScope object, but cannot be used to bypass the same origin restriction.
This is not the case in Firefox and cross-origin site can create SharedWorker using data URL SharedWorker script.

This affects Chrome too. I provided their bug ID if you want to coordinate with them. Chrome assigned Security\_Severity-High, and already working on fix. They are aiming to fix this on M-63.

This is technically a same-origin policy violation and so chrome's "high" severity makes sense, but the opportunities for abuse don't seem to justify that rating. An attacker would have to find a site that uses a data: shared worker instead of a URL from their site, but that was not dynamic so they could use exactly the same one, and then hope the worker was doing some sort of shared state that leaked useful info. Since it's a data URL it wouldn't be able to fetch any non-public data from the site so it could have secrets if the initiating page passed them in.Group: firefox-core-security → dom-core-securityStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: Untriaged → DOM: WorkersEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [csectype-sop](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-sop&resolution=---),

I meant to link to the code for GenerateSharedWorkerKey here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/workers/RuntimeService.cpp#260>
That should probably take the PrincipalInfo instead of just OriginAttributes so it can do something smarter.

I'm not sure a single subsumes is correct here. It lets a more privileged window attach to a shared worker created by a less privileged window. This is dangerous because then the lesser window can influence the more powerful window.
Can we maybe do two subsumes checks here? From new window to shared worker principal and also in the reverse direction?

This seems a bit dangerous to me. Could you instead make the array nsTArray<UniquePtr<SharedWorkerInfo>> to avoid needing this?

Approval Request Comment
[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: SharedWorker
[User impact if declined]: data URL could have access to shared SharedWorkers. This is against the spec.
[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: no. It will be done in a follow up.
[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: locally
[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: there is a test in the description of the bug
[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: none
[Is the change risky?]: low
[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: Instead of using a key, this patch uses nsIPrincipal to know if a page can have access to a SharedWorker
[String changes made/needed]: none
would be nice to have this patch for 52.Flags: needinfo?(amarchesini)

This indeed fixed the bug, but you need to take another look. What this did is to never allow connecting Shared Worker using data URL, even if same-origin. This will break the site using data URL.

Attached patch

[part 2](attachment.cgi?id=8932806&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1419166&attachment=8932806)

The spec talks about comparing the 'constructor origin', not the worker principal. This patch introduces a mLoadingPrincipal in WorkerLoadInfo and cleans up the replacing of mPrincipal from the channel.
mLoadingPrincipal is taken from the parent and it's null only for ServiceWorkers.

Ok, the spec does specifically talk about supporting this.
I'm a little bit nervous about these changes. The clients code needs the real, final principal set very early. Its hard for me to tell from the patch if thats still the case. It would be really nice to see a try run showing it doesn't his any of the clients assertions.
Also, we obviously don't have a test for this feature. We should add a WPT test case for it.
Since this is fixing a feature regression and is not directly exposing any security problems, can we move it to a non-secure bug? That way we could include the test and try runs, etc.

Well, not removing the sec flag here. The original [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1419166#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Cross-origin Shared Worker using data: url") here is still a security issue in release.
But filing a new bug for fixing the sharing of data URL SharedWorkers by same-origin parents.

Honestly I don't understand the rush. Yes we regressed something here, but it is a corner case in a somewhat lightly used feature. As long as we have a fix for the regression uplifted in the next week or two it seems fine.
Also, I'm really hesitant to rush another patch through here since we clearly don't have adequate tests for this stuff at the moment.
I think it would be more prudent to mark this bug FIXED and open a new non-secure bug to fix the functinal regression. Then we can land tests together with it cleanly. This would give me more confidence that we're not making the problem worse.
I also looked at the patch again. One thing I'd like to add is some documentation about how mLoadingPrincipal relates to mPrincipal. When is one set and not the other, etc. Also, it would be nice to have assertions that mLoadingPrincipal relates to mPrincipal in a way we expect. For example, I think they should be equal unless the script is a data URL in which case mPrincipal becomes a null principal.Flags: needinfo?(bkelly)

That's correct. At least until we add sandboxing to workers.
Andrea, I was thinking that if you don't like loadingPrincipal, another name could be initialPrincipal or creatingPrincipal.

Wait, there is a functional regression from this patch that is fixed in another bug. If you uplift this to ESR you should uplift that as well. Let me find the related bug.

See [bug 1423507](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423507 "RESOLVED FIXED - Data URL Shared Workers must be shared when the parent origins match"). It is only in FF59 currently. Also there was some assertion fallout from that bug, so I'm not sure we should uplift it. For example [bug 1424336](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424336 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in mozilla::dom::workers::WorkerLoadInfo::GetPrincipalAndLoadGroupFromChannel due to MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT(mLoadingPrincipal)") and [bug 1428447](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428447 "RESOLVED FIXED - service workers should set the WorkerPrivate mLoadingPrincipal").
Give this is only a moderate privacy risk and there were problems from this fix I personally would be in favor of just waiting for ESR60.

So, ultimately we do need to uplift this bug and these follow-on fixes to ESR:
[bug 1423507](/show_bug.cgi?id=1423507 "RESOLVED FIXED - Data URL Shared Workers must be shared when the parent origins match")
[bug 1424336](/show_bug.cgi?id=1424336 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in mozilla::dom::workers::WorkerLoadInfo::GetPrincipalAndLoadGroupFromChannel due to MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT(mLoadingPrincipal)")
[bug 1426162](/show_bug.cgi?id=1426162 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash in (anonymous namespace)::LoaderListener::OnStreamComplete")
[bug 1428447](/show_bug.cgi?id=1428447 "RESOLVED FIXED - service workers should set the WorkerPrivate mLoadingPrincipal")
Currently only this bug is uplifted to beta and none of those follow-on bugs.
So the question is, do we want to:
1. Uplift all of those bugs to beta and ESR now before the imminent merge.
2. Backout this bug from beta and uplift them all to ESR after the merge for the next release cycle.
Its hard for me to make the call which way to go. Since its sec-moderate I think (2) would be ok, but maybe we should attempt (1).
Danial, Julien, what do you think? Can we uplift to beta today before the first merge and then uplift to ESR the following week?Flags: needinfo?(jcristau)Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Flags: needinfo?(bkelly)

#### [#CVE-2018-5131: Fetch API improperly returns cached copies of no-store/no-cache resources](#CVE-2018-5131)

Reporter
Ben Kelly
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Under certain circumstances the `fetch()` API can return transient local copies of resources that were sent with a `no-store` or `no-cache` cache header instead of downloading a copy from the network as it should. This can result in previously stored, locally cached data of a website being accessible to users if they share a common profile while browsing.

* [Bug 1440775](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440775)

#### [#CVE-2018-5132: WebExtension Find API can search privileged pages](#CVE-2018-5132)

Reporter
Andy McKay
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Find API for WebExtensions can search some privileged pages, such as `about:debugging`, if these pages are open in a tab. This could allow a malicious WebExtension to search for otherwise protected data if a user has it open.

##### References

* [Bug 1408194](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408194)

#### [#CVE-2018-5133: Value of the app.support.baseURL preference is not properly sanitized](#CVE-2018-5133)

Reporter
François Lajeunesse-Robert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `app.support.baseURL` preference is changed by a malicious local program to contain HTML and script content, this content is not sanitized. It will be executed if a user loads `chrome://browser/content/preferences/in-content/preferences.xul` directly in a tab and executes a search. This stored preference is also executed whenever an EME video player plugin displays a CDM-disabled message as a notification message.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions may use `view-source:` URLs to view local `file:` URL content, as well as content stored in `about:cache`, bypassing restrictions that only allow WebExtensions to view specific content.

##### References

* [Bug 1429379](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429379)

#### [#CVE-2018-5135: WebExtension browserAction can inject scripts into unintended contexts](#CVE-2018-5135)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebExtensions can bypass normal restrictions in some circumstances and use `browser.tabs.executeScript` to inject scripts into contexts where this should not be allowed, such as pages from other WebExtensions or unprivileged `about:` pages.

##### References

* [Bug 1431371](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1431371)

#### [#CVE-2018-5136: Same-origin policy violation with data: URL shared workers](#CVE-2018-5136)

Reporter

Impact
moderate
##### Description

A shared worker created from a `data:` URL in one tab can be shared by another tab with a different origin, bypassing the same-origin policy.

##### References

* [Bug 1419166](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419166)

#### [#CVE-2018-5137: Script content can access legacy extension non-contentaccessible resources](#CVE-2018-5137)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A legacy extension's non-contentaccessible, defined resources can be loaded by an arbitrary web page through script. This script does this by using a maliciously crafted path string to reference the resources.
*Note: this vulnerability does not affect WebExtensions.*

* [Bug 1432870](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432870)

#### [#CVE-2018-5138: Android Custom Tab address spoofing through long domain names](#CVE-2018-5138)

Reporter
rugk
Impact
low
##### Description

A spoofing vulnerability can occur when a malicious site with an extremely long domain name is opened in an Android Custom Tab (a browser panel inside another app) and the default browser is Firefox for Android. This could allow an attacker to spoof which page is actually loaded and in use.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other versions and operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1432624](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432624)

#### [#CVE-2018-5140: Moz-icon images accessible to web content through moz-icon: protocol](#CVE-2018-5140)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
low
##### Description

Image for moz-icons can be accessed through the `moz-icon:` protocol through script in web content even when otherwise prohibited. This could allow for information leakage of which applications are associated with specific MIME types by a malicious page.

##### References

* [Bug 1424261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424261)

#### [#CVE-2018-5141: DOS attack through notifications Push API](#CVE-2018-5141)

Reporter
Zohar
Impact
low
##### Description

A vulnerability in the notifications Push API where notifications can be sent through service workers by web content without direct user interaction. This could be used to open new tabs in a denial of service (DOS) attack or to display unwanted content from arbitrary URLs to users.

##### References

* [Bug 1429093](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429093)

#### [#CVE-2018-5142: Media Capture and Streams API permissions display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2018-5142)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If Media Capture and Streams API permission is requested from documents with `data:` or `blob:` URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown protocol" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1366357](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1366357)

#### [#CVE-2018-5143: Self-XSS pasting javascript: URL with embedded tab into addressbar](#CVE-2018-5143)

Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
low
##### Description

URLs using `javascript:` have the protocol removed when pasted into the addressbar to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, but if a tab character is embedded in the `javascript:` URL the protocol is not removed and the script will execute. This could allow users to be socially engineered to run an XSS attack against themselves.

#### [#CVE-2018-5126: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 59](#CVE-2018-5126)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Calixte Denizet, Christian Holler, Sebastian Hengst, Jason Kratzer, Tyson Smith, Ryan VanderMeulen, Noemi Erli, Karl Tomlinson, Philipp, Gary Kwong, and Ronald Crane reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 58. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
