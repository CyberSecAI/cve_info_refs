{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of data received over WLAN leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds write",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege. A local attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the WLAN interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in a position to interact with the vulnerable device via WLAN."
