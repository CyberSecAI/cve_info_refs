    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's TCP implementation makes expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for each incoming packet, leading to CPU saturation and denial of service. The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted TCP packets within ongoing TCP sessions.",
