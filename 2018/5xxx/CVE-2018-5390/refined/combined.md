## [L1TF](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/L1TF)

# L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)

## CVE-2018-3615 (also known as Foreshadow), CVE-2018-3620, and CVE-2018-3646

Raoul Strackx, Jo Van Bulck, Marina Minkin, Ofir Weisse, Daniel Genkin, Baris Kasikci, Frank Piessens, Mark Silberstein, Thomas F. Wenisch, Yuval Yarom, and researchers from Intel discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that's executing on the CPU core. If a victim process and malicious process are scheduled on the same core, the malicious process could access contents of the L1 data cache that pertain to the victim process. Hyper-Threads, also known as Symmetric Multi-Threading (SMT), make it easier to exploit L1TF since sibling Hyper-Threads belong to a single CPU core and share the same L1 data cache. Unintended memory exposure can occur between userspace processes, between the kernel and userspace, and between virtual machines, and between a virtual machine and the host environment.

Processors from other vendors are not known to be affected by L1TF.

Three CVEs have been assigned to this issue:

* [CVE-2018-3615](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-3615.html) for Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX)
* [CVE-2018-3620](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-3620.html) for operating systems and System Management Mode (SMM)
* [CVE-2018-3646](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-3646.html) for impacts to virtualization

Ubuntu users are recommended to update to the latest kernel and intel-microcode packages. Updated kernels provide a software fallback mechanism for processors that will not receive microcode updates from Intel.

Consult the Ubuntu Security Notices below for version information:

| **Ubuntu Release** | **Base Kernel** | **Enablement Kernel** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 18.04 LTS | [USN-3740-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-1/) | N/A |
| 16.04 LTS | [USN-3741-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-1/) | [USN-3740-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-2/) |
| 14.04 LTS | [USN-3741-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-3/) **\*** | [USN-3741-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-2/) |
| 12.04 ESM | [USN-3823-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3823-1/) | [USN-3742-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-3/) **\*** |

**\* Regression note:** There were two regressions ([Bug #1787127](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1787127) and [Bug #1787258](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1787258)) in the 3.13.0-155 kernel. The USNs in the table refer to the regression fix updates.

Due to the complexity of the changes involved in mitigating this hardware vulnerability, a livepatch will [not be available](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2018-August/004535.html) via the [Canonical Livepatch Service](https://www.ubuntu.com/server/livepatch).

Users who are unable to reboot into an updated kernel may be interested in the smt snap that can be used to disable Hyper-Threading. Please see its [documentation](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/smt-snap/tree/README.user) for details. Disabling Hyper-Threading, without rebooting into an updated kernel, does not provide full mitigation for L1TF but it does make it more difficult to exploit. Updating to the latest kernel and rebooting is recommended.

## Mitigations

The techniques used to provide remediation for these issues vary. A summary, for each of the three attack scenarios, is provided in the following subsections. Additionally, the [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/l1tf.html) provides full details on configuration options available.

### CVE-2018-3615

This issue does not affect Ubuntu. See the references below to find information from Intel for L1TF mitigations for Intel SGX.

### CVE-2018-3620

This issue is fully mitigated by Ubuntu kernel updates. The updates remove the possibility for unintended memory exposure between processes within the same operating system environment by adjusting page table entries for not-present pages to point to uncacheable memory. The mitigation for this vulnerability introduces negligible performance impacts.

### CVE-2018-3646

This issue is partially mitigated by Ubuntu kernel and intel-microcode updates but controls are available to fully mitigate it in situations where complete protection is required. This issue only affects virtualization hypervisors and does not impact systems where virtualization is not used. Mitigations provided by the Ubuntu kernel are specific to KVM in the Linux kernel. Consult your hypervisor vendor if you're using another hypervisor.

By default, updated Ubuntu kernels will flush the L1 data cache in some specific scenarios when the host enters the guest. Flushing the L1 data cache is an expensive operation that negates the performance improvements of caching so flushing the L1 data cache is performed selectively to protect certain code paths that could cause unintended memory exposure to a malicious guest.

Optimized L1 data cache flushing is available via intel-microcode updates. The updated kernels implement a software fallback cache flushing mechanism for processors that have not received microcode updates.

Configuration options are available to deviate from the default L1 data cache flushing behavior and either always perform a cache flush or never perform a cache flush when entering a guest. Always flushing the cache will negatively impact performance in a manner that's dependent on the workload inside of the virtual machine while never flushing the cache will make your system vulnerable to CVE-2018-3646. Use the "kvm-intel.vmentry\_l1d\_flush=always" or "kvm-intel.vmentry\_l1d\_flush=never" kernel command line options to change the default persistently across reboots. Write "always", "cond" (the default), or "never" to /sys/module/kvm\_intel/parameters/vmentry\_l1d\_flush to temporarily change the behavior.

Processors that support Hyper-Threads introduce an additional attack surface that must be considered since mitigation is not enabled by default. It is possible that a malicious guest could read secrets stored in memory by the host (userspace or kernel) or another guest if the two operating system environments simultaneously run on sibling Hyper-Threads from the same CPU core.

Full protection from the Hyper-Thread based attack can be achieved in one of two ways. The first option requires that Hyper-Threads be disabled in the system's BIOS, by booting with the "nosmt" kernel command line option, or by writing "off" or "forceoff" to /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control (this file is not persistent across reboots). The second option involves restricting guests to specific CPU cores that are not shared with the host or other guests considered to be in different trust domains. This option is more difficult to configure and may still allow a malicious guest to gain some information from the host environment.

OpenStack administrators will want to ensure that guests running in separate trust domains do not execute on sibling Hyper-Threads by using one of the options described above.

## Checking System Status

Updated Ubuntu kernels have the ability to report how the system is currently affected by L1TF. To check your system, read the contents of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf file. You must apply kernel updates and reboot if the file does not exist as that indicates that your kernel does not have mitigations in place for L1TF.

Processors that aren't vulnerable to L1TF will report the following:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Not affected
```

The file will contain the following contents for processors that do not support Intel Hyper-Threading or where Hyper-Threading has been disabled:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: conditional cache flushes, SMT disabled
```

Processors that have Hyper-Threading support enabled will indicate that SMT is vulnerable when used in conjunction with Intel Virtualization Technology (VMX):

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: conditional cache flushes, SMT vulnerable
```

Intel processors that lack VMX support will not report VMX status:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Mitigation: PTE Inversion
```

In some cases, which are believed to be rare, there may be no mitigation available due to the PTE inversion technique being incompatible with the number of physical address bits used by the processor and the amount of memory installed in the system. In these cases, the file will indicate the no mitigations are in place and that the system is vulnerable:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Vulnerable
```

If you've modified the default behavior of L1 data cache flushes, the VMX status will indicate the change in behavior. If the selected mode is always, the file contents will be similar to the following (Hyper-Threading is disabled in the example but may be enabled on your system):

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: cache flushes, SMT disabled
```

If the selected mode is "never", the file contents will be similar to the following (Hyper-Threading is disabled in the example but may be enabled on your system):

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: vulnerable, SMT disabled
```

It is possible to check if your system is using the L1 data cache flush mechanism provided by updated microcode or if it is using the software fallback mechanism provided by the kernel. Cache flushes will be performed by the microcode when the "flush\_l1d" feature is listed in the CPU flags field (your system may have a different set of CPU flags listed):

```
$ grep -m 1 flush_l1d /proc/cpuinfo
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx pdpe1gb rdtscp lm constant_tsc art arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc cpuid aperfmperf tsc_known_freq pni pclmulqdq dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx est tm2 ssse3 sdbg fma cx16 xtpr pdcm pcid sse4_1 sse4_2 x2apic movbe popcnt tsc_deadline_timer aes xsave avx f16c rdrand lahf_lm abm 3dnowprefetch cpuid_fault epb invpcid_single pti ssbd ibrs ibpb stibp tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority ept vpid fsgsbase tsc_adjust bmi1 avx2 smep bmi2 erms invpcid mpx rdseed adx smap clflushopt intel_pt xsaveopt xsavec xgetbv1 xsaves dtherm ida arat pln pts hwp hwp_notify hwp_act_window hwp_epp flush_l1d
```

The software fallback mechanism will be in use if the "flush\_l1d" flag is not present.

Thank you.

Sure, give me a day or two to get it out. I'll cross-post
LKML/ksummit-discuss/oss-security as I think it's one of those times it
actually makes sense.

Whatever list admins/members are comfortable with.

Yes, this is tricky. Maybe "Microsoft Linux Systems Group"? Thats our
group name within Microsoft. I guess that we can also add a short wiki
page with references to the products/distros we support as well as a
clarification that this has nothing to do with Windows and list MSRC's
contact information.

As I've indicated before, we intend to follow the list's policies.
Information obtained from the list will be used only for the purposes
listed in our original application, and any additional future use will
go through the list for approvals first.

Merge branch 'tcp-robust-ooo'Eric Dumazet says:
====================
Juha-Matti Tilli reported that malicious peers could inject tiny
packets in out\_of\_order\_queue, forcing very expensive calls
to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() for
every incoming packet.
With tcp\_rmem[2] default of 6MB, the ooo queue could
contain ~7000 nodes.
This patch series makes sure we cut cpu cycles enough to
render the attack not critical.
We might in the future go further, like disconnecting
or black-holing proven malicious flows.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2776)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, making the total buffer size bigger than the memory size for early allocation through the trace\_buf\_size boot option, made the system become unresponsive at the boot stage. This update introduces a change in the early memory allocation. As a result, the system no longer hangs in the above described scenario. (BZ#1588365)
* When inserting objects with the same keys, made the rhlist implementation corrupt the chain pointers. As a consequence, elements were missing on removal and traversal. This patch updates the chain pointers correctly. As a result, there are no missing elements on removal and traversal in the above-described scenario. (BZ#1601008)
* Previously, the kernel source code was missing support to report the Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) vulnerability status on IBM Power Systems and the little-endian variants of IBM Power Systems. As a consequence, the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec\_store\_bypass file incorrectly reported "Not affected" on both CPU architectures. This fix updates the kernel source code to properly report the SSBD status either as "Vulnerable" or "Mitigation: Kernel entry/exit barrier (TYPE)" where TYPE is one of "eieio", "hwsync", "fallback", or "unknown". (BZ#1612352)
* Previously, the early microcode updater in the kernel was trying to perform a microcode update on virtualized guests. As a consequence, the virtualized guests sometimes mishandled the request to perform the microcode update and became unresponsive in the early boot stage. This update applies an upstream patch to avoid the early microcode update when running under a hypervisor. As a result, no kernel freezes appear in the described scenario. (BZ#1618389)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.

Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9. Future kernel updates for the respective releases will address this issue.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but to a lesser degree. As such, the issue severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate. This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle and the issue severity.

It is incorrect to focus on version number, instead the focus should be on the specific feature or bug/security fix that the later upstream software have.  <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2074>  Current RHEL release with moderate new kernels are affected. Fixes are backported by Red Hat from upstream and are released as backported version i.e 2.6.32.x or 3.10.x.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1601704#c18)  Ethan Schorer    2018-08-12 13:09:21 UTC  ``` Continuing Frank's question and Himanchu's answer. RHEL 5.11 was released in 9/2014 while kernel 4.9 was released in 12/2016.

The network stack was backported to RHEL-7 from the (approx.) version 4.14 upstream Linux kernel, so this flaw was backported too. Parts of the latest network stack were backported to RHEL-6 and -5 also. So the answer to your question is - no, you are not safe, these RHEL versions are vulnerable.  RHEL-5 is affected by these flaws by a significantly lesser degree. As such, the flaws severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate.  Please, also note, this Bugzilla is not a support tool and does not have SLAs for replies. Please, open a support ticket at Red Hat Portal access.redhat.com or email secalert for security-related questions, these systems are monitored and have SLAs.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1601704#c25)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 19:49:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ethan Schorer from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1601704#c18)) > So, I can understand how later updates to RHEL 6,7 got the buggy code - but > is RHEL 5.x actually affected?  RHEL-5 is affected by these flaws by a significantly lesser degree. Namely, in our tests only a high-speed attack of 1Mpps (packets, not bytes or bits) was able to barely saturate 1 CPU core. As such, the flaws severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate.  Please, also note, this Bugzilla is not a support tool and does not have SLAs for replies.

Thank you for your reply.  Is the kernel in your product a Red Hat's kernel (i.e. RHEL)? If yes, then yes again, it is affected. Namely, in our tests a 30 kpps 1-stream attack fully saturates 1 core of the 2-cores RHEL-6 system.  If the kernel in your product is not a Red Hat's kernel, then most probably it is vulnerable, please, confirm this with your kernel vendor.

True, but we care about more than just the kernel side of things.

Can I suggest that we fork the discussion around security-bugs.rst to
LKML? I can suggest an initial patch to address your comments here but I
think that this is better handled on LKML.

My concern with Monday is timezones: we should do the math here, but I'd
like to avoid spilling over to Sunday (or very early Monday for that
matter) for some timezones.

As far as I understand specific dates for the microarchitectural bugs
were set pretty late in the process.

It's not just the microarchitectural bugs I was referring to, we are
getting security reports from users about security bugs in various
distros and we end up circling back with relevant distros to patch them
up. A recent example would be:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1834499](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1834499) where an
internal user has reported a kernel memory leak due to a missing patch
in Ubuntu.

Microsoft's history with Linux is a rather recent one. I can offer the
following examples if you're willing to give us a few months off of the
"1 year" requirement:

CVE-2018-1002105: <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/aks-clusters-patched-for-kubernetes-vulnerability/>

I'd love to develop a framework that would allow for sharing of reports
between linux-distros/security@.../MSRC given the explicit approval of
the reporter. I think that the current "silo" model is broken.

Microsoft in general, and MSRC in particular have proved during
Meltdown/Spectre that they are a trusted entity which can work well with
the open source community to advance our common goals.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391.

Bug Fix(es):

* On systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.5, a node sometimes got into "NodeNotReady" state after a CPU softlockup. Consequently, the node was not available. This update fixes an irq latency source in memory compaction. As a result, nodes no longer get into "NodeNotReady" state under the described circumstances. (BZ#1596281)
* Previously, the kernel source code was missing support to report the Speculative Store Bypass Disable (SSBD) vulnerability status on IBM Power Systems and the little-endian variants of IBM Power Systems. As a consequence, the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spec\_store\_bypass file incorrectly reported "Not affected" on both CPU architectures. This fix updates the kernel source code to properly report the SSBD status either as "Vulnerable" or "Mitigation: Kernel entry/exit barrier (TYPE)" where TYPE is one of "eieio", "hwsync", "fallback", or "unknown". (BZ#1612351)
* The hypervisors of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 virtual machines (VMs) in certain circumstances mishandled the microcode update in the kernel. As a consequence, the VMs sometimes became unresponsive when booting. This update applies an upstream patch to avoid early microcode update when running under a hypervisor. As a result, kernel hangs no longer occur in the described scenario. (BZ#1618388)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Topic

An update for rhvm-appliance is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The RHV-M Virtual Appliance automates the process of installing and configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. The appliance is available to download as an OVA file from the Customer Portal.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646 and Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390.

## Details

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2018-5390

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Linux kernel. Linux kernel versions 4.9 and higher are susceptible to a vulnerability that can force them to make very expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() for every incoming packet. A remote attacker with the ability to send TCP traffic to an affected system could cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker cause Denial of Service (DoS).

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2645)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting this issue.

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5390 CVE-2018-13405

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2018-5390

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that a remote attacker can trigger the
    worst case code paths for TCP stream reassembly with low rates of
    specially crafted packets leading to remote denial of service.

CVE-2018-13405

    Jann Horn discovered that the inode_init_owner function in
    fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to create files
    with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to escalate
    privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u1. This update includes fixes for several
regressions in the latest point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

# USN-3741-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

14 August 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3741-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

* Overview

Red Hat has been made aware of a new computer microprocessor hardware implementation (microarchitecture) issue similar to Spectre and Meltdown which has been reported to affect x86 microprocessors manufactured by Intel. Unprivileged attackers can use this flaw to bypass memory security restrictions in order to gain access to data stored in memory that would otherwise be inaccessible.  There are three pieces to this vulnerability. The first affects only Intel “SGX” secure enclaves and is mitigated through microcode updates independently of the operating system. The other two pieces require software-level mitigations performed by operating systems and hypervisors. Full mitigation from potential attack by untrusted guest virtual machines in an environment using virtualization will require specific action by a system administrator.

[CVE-2018-3620](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3620) is the CVE identifier assigned to the operating system vulnerability for this issue. [CVE-2018-3646](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3646) is the CVE identifier assigned to the virtualization aspect of the flaw. This issue is referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) by the larger industry and as “Foreshadow” by the security researcher.

The L1 Terminal Fault vulnerability allows a malicious actor to bypass memory access security controls ordinarily imposed and managed by the operating system or hypervisor. An attacker can use this vulnerability to read any physical memory location that is cached in the [L1 data cache](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Flwn.net%2FArticles%2F252125%2F) of the processor. Normally, operating system and hypervisor managed “page tables” provide information to the processor about which memory locations should be accessible to an application, the operating system kernel itself, and guest virtual machine instances. These page tables are formed from page table entries (PTEs) that include a “present” bit indicating validity. In exploiting L1TF, an attacker abuses the Intel processor logic that recognizes valid PTEs.

The L1 data cache (typically 32KB in size) is the first level of a fast on-chip processor memory hierarchy that contains copies of data also held in the external (to the processor) main memory chips. Caches are populated as memory is used by programs, and are typically separated into multiple levels. A small and fast highest level (L1) cache is closest to the processor functional units that perform the actual calculations within a program, while progressively larger and slower caches are located conceptually further away. The L1 is shared between two peer hyperthreads within an Intel processor core. Each core also has a slightly larger L2 cache. The L3 (also called an LLC or Last Level Cache) is shared by all of the cores within the processor and is much larger (e.g. 32MB). Data moves from memory, to the L3, and toward the L1 when it is used.

Accesses to the cache memory within the processor chip are orders of magnitude faster than going out to main memory, so it is used to significantly enhance performance. The data cache is also populated as a side-effect of operations performed during speculative or Out-of-Order execution. As a result of this relative difference in the performance of the caches as compared with memory, it is possible for malicious software code to infer cache activity. This is known as side-channel analysis, and was popularized by Meltdown and Spectre. In those vulnerabilities, as in L1TF, specific software sequences, known as “gadgets” can be created that exploit a vulnerable processor to cause observable cache activity during speculation.

L1TF is similar to Meltdown, insomuch that it exploits how vulnerable processors implement a form of speculation, in this case during the searching of page tables (known as a table walk). The processor is designed to yield the most aggressive performance possible, so it speculates that page table entries are valid and permit access to the underlying memory location prior to completing the necessary validity checks. The processor will preemptively search its L1 data cache for any physical address matching bits in the page table entry, forwarding any match to dependent speculative operations. After a small time, the processor will detect that the page table entry is not valid and signal an internal “terminal fault”. The processor then unwinds (throws away) previously speculated results, but observable impact upon the cache remains.

In the case of virtualized guest instances, the L1TF vulnerability manifests because of an aspect of the implementation of a technology within Intel processors known as “Extended Page Tables” (EPT). This hardware performance feature allows hypervisors (such as KVM) to delegate part of the management of page tables to guest virtual machines. Each memory access is subject to two translations - first by the guest, and then by the host page tables. This saves the overhead caused by repeated assistance from the hypervisor, which used to be required prior to EPT. In vulnerable implementations, a malicious guest is able to create a “not present” page table entry that will shortcut the normal two stages of translation, resulting in the guest being able to read host hypervisor or other guest physical memory if a copy exists in the L1 data cache.

There are two attack patterns that end-users will need to protect against: a malicious user on a system reading data on the physical system or a malicious guest OS or container accessing information from other guests or the host. This vulnerability is similar to [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (aka “Meltdown”) but exploits an interaction between the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the L1 Data Cache under speculation when performing virtual to physical memory address translation. Existing mitigations for previous microarchitectural vulnerabilities (“Meltdown,” aka “Variant 3”) are not sufficient to protect against this new vulnerability.

Red Hat strongly recommends that customers take corrective  actions, including manually enabling specific kernel parameters or potentially disabling features like Intel Hyper-Threading, after the available updates have been applied. More details can be found in the Mitigations section of this article.

## Background Information

Modern operating systems implement a ‘virtual memory’ scheme to efficiently use available main memory across multiple tasks/processes. Physical systems have fixed amounts of main memory which form the **physical address** space. This address space is divided into smaller managed units known as pages (e.g. 4KB). The operating system creates **virtual address** spaces for each running program (known as a process). Each virtual address is translated into an underlying physical address using a special piece of hardware within the processor, known as the Memory Management Unit (MMU). When a processor schedules a program for execution, its instructions and data are mapped into virtual addresses. Programs use virtual addresses to reference memory locations. The processor’s MMU uses a concept known as **Paging** to perform the translation between virtual addresses and their underlying mapped physical memory addresses.

![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1tf1_0.png)

The **Paging** technique translates each virtual address to a physical address by using hierarchical paging structures known as page tables. These translate portions of the virtual address using bits from the address as indexes into components of the page tables. Page tables are built from fixed size records/entries which hold a physical address pointing to either another paging structure entry or the mapped memory page. Along with the physical address, a paging structure entry also holds various attribute bits about the physical address. These include a bit indicating whether the page is present (**P flag**) in the physical memory or not (swapped out). A page table entry marked as not present is supposed to be ignored by the processor MMU logic.

##### Page Structure Entry:

The Intel Software Developers Manual (Volume 3, Chapter 4) defines the hardware paging structures used by Intel processors, including the 64-bit Page Table Entry (PTE) used to store the physical address during a virtual to physical address translation.

![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1ft2-2.png)

During address translation, the processor will walk through the page table structures, ultimately arriving upon a Page Table Entry that contains a possible physical translation for a particular virtual address. This address translation process terminates when the virtual address resolves to a mapped page frame in the physical memory OR when a paging structure entry indicates that the required page frame is **not present (P flag(bit zero) = 0)** in the main memory OR it has **reserved bits set**. Accessing the physical address from such an entry results in the page-fault exception (aka “terminal fault”).

While Red Hat's Linux Containers are not directly impacted by kernel issues, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends that you use the most recent versions of your container images. The Container Health Index, part of the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/), can always be used to verify the security status of Red Hat containers. To protect the privacy of the containers in use, you will need to ensure that the Container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or [Atomic Host](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-linux-atomic-host-datasheet)) has been updated against these attacks. Red Hat has released an updated Atomic Host for this use case.

## Attack Description and Impact

### Traditional Host Attack Vector:

When a processor supports speculative execution of instructions, a speculative load from a virtual address which cannot be resolved to a physical address leads to a page-fault exception during its translation process. Before this page-fault exception is delivered, speculative execution of the load instruction uses the physical address from the **not present (P flag = 0)** OR **reserved bits set** paging structure entry to access the physical memory. If the physical memory location was cached in the L1 data cache, the speculative load reads data from an inappropriate physical memory location. As a result, subsequent speculative operations use this data and can have measurable impact upon the caches that an attacker can use to read unauthorized data.

An unprivileged system user or process could exploit the L1TF vulnerability to read data from arbitrary physical memory locations of the kernel and/or other processes running on the system provided that the data is first loaded into the L1 data cache. Since loads into the L1 data cache are an intrinsic component of the processor, a malicious attacker only has to wait for a program containing secrets of interest to load those secrets while performing normal operations. This can include cryptographic keys, and other data.

### Virtualization Attack Vector:

Virtualized guest environments compound the impact from exploiting this vulnerability. In virtualized environments, guests often run an operating system which manages memory as if it were running on a bare metal host machine. What the guest operating system perceives as physical memory is in reality a virtual address space on the host, created by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, e.g. KVM), also known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor introduces a layer of memory virtualization to ensure that it has control over the true host physical memory and so that it can provide isolated virtual address spaces to numerous guests while managing their access to the host physical memory. This means that virtualized environments have two levels of memory translations.

To facilitate efficient translation of the Guest physical addresses to Host physical addresses, hardware processors have introduced the **E**xtended **P**age **T**able (**EPT**) feature.

EPT is similar to the hierarchical Paging structures used by the host operating system to translate virtual addresses to physical memory addresses. While translating Guest physical addresses to Host physical addresses, just like page-fault exceptions on the host, **EPT Violation** exceptions cause VM exits, indicating that the given guest physical address translation can not resolve to a host physical address OR the guest does not have permissions to access the given host memory.

Similar to the host, speculative execution of instructions by a guest user can leverage those EPT violations-induced VM exits to read data from host physical memory via cache side-channel attacks. Since the guest operating system can control guest physical address bits in the EPT paging entry, a guest user can target specific host physical addresses and read data via the L1 data cache, including arbitrary host kernel memory and/or memory of the other guests/processes running on the host.

### Simultaneous Multithreading Attack Vector:

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allows modern processors to improve system performance by executing more than one instruction stream simultaneously on separate logical processors. i.e. the CPU creates two or more logical processors with their own set of data registers, control registers, segment registers etc. which form their architectural state. These logical processors execute separate instruction streams while sharing the same execution engine, processor caches, TLB, system bus interface, etc.
![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1tf4.png)

Considering that two logical processors share the processor cache, any cache manipulation operation performed by one logical processor will be visible to the other one. Ie. an application/guest running on one logical processor could leverage L1TF and speculative execution of instructions to read arbitrary memory contents of other processes and the kernel from the shared data cache.

The simultaneous nature of Intel Hyper-threading means that flushing the cache on a peer logical processor when switching virtual machine instances running on it leaves a small window of time during which secrets might be reloaded by the peer and visible to a malicious attacker running code on the other logical processor. There is currently no standard way to guarantee that this cannot happen,

As a consequence, virtualized environments should not schedule two different virtual machines to share two logical processors from a single core. In addition, when a full Linux stack is running on the host, which is able to load its own secrets in response to events such as interrupts, it is not safe to enable hyperthreading if running untrusted guests on a logical processor.

## Performance impact

Mitigating L1TF in bare metal environments that do not use virtualization has negligible performance impact and does not require specific action beyond installing the updates.

Mitigating L1TF in virtualized environments requires that the hypervisor check whether to flush the L1 data cache (L1D) of potential secrets from other virtual machines (or the host) whenever it begins running virtual machine code. Depending upon the workload, it may also be necessary to disable Intel Hyper-threading, in order to prevent a malicious virtual machine running on one hyperthread from attacking another on its peer thread.

The L1 data cache makes data available to the CPU much faster than the main memory and (almost) all data loaded from memory must pass through it. Once the L1 data cache is flushed, the CPU needs to spend hundreds of cycles to repopulate those entries from lower level caches. This is expensive in terms of time spent on data access. In terms of relative efficiency, L1 data cache takes 1x CPU cycles, while the same data access from lower level caches could take 4x CPU cycles. Data access from main memory could take 60-70x or more cycles. Since data contained within the L1 is also contained within the higher level caches, it will typically be refilled from the L2 at only modest impact to performance. This overhead also increases external interrupt and other event latency.

Similarly, Hyper-Threading (an SMT implementation) simultaneously executes more than one instruction stream to gain system performance. Disabling these threads would drop the number of logical CPUs seen by the system by half, thus significantly reducing the overall compute throughput of a system and its performance.

Note the actual performance impact of these measures is subject to the workload and can vary from one workload to another. More details about the workload specific performance impact can be seen here:   [Performance considerations for L1 Terminal Fault](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/L1TF-perf)

## Diagnose your vulnerability

Use the detection script to determine if your system is currently vulnerable to this flaw. To verify the legitimacy of the script, you can [download the detached GPG signature](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2018-3620--2021-07-19-1207.sh.asc) as well, with the signing key on our [Product Security openPGP Keys](https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key) page . The current version of the script is **1.6**.

Additonally, two Ansible playbooks are provided below. The first, *CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml*, can be applied to systems which have not been updated to address L1TF to disable Hyper-Threading without restarting the system. The playbook will make an effort to determine if the system is acting as a hypervisor and has any running VMs, but be aware that offlining Hyper-Threading can cause unexpected behavior in applications with specific core/thread affinity. If the system's kernel doesn't include the necessary features, it will fail with a message to that effect. In that case, it is recommended that you update to the latest kernel and use the second playbook, which takes advantage of L1TF-aware kernel features.

To use the *CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml* playbook, simply call ansible-playbook with the hosts you'd like to change specified in the **HOSTS** extra var:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers,db01,portal" CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml**

The second playbook, *CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml*, will help you enable mitigations provided by an L1TF-aware kernel. There are three settings you can specify:

* **FLUSH=1** will change the behavior of the kernel and the kvm-intel kernel module to flush the L1 data cache on every VM enter, not just those where the kernel detects that a flush is necessary. While there are performance implications, this will provide a stronger guarantee that information isn't shared between VMs, and should prevent information leaks such as ASLR derandomization. This setting should only be necessary if you are running a hypervisor with untrusted guest systems.
* **NOSMT=1** will disable Hyper-Threading, both for the live system and at boot time. As with the first playbook, an attempt is made to determine if there are active guests to prevent offlining threads which have set affinity.
* **FORCE=1** will, when combined with **NO****SMT=1**, prevent SMT from being re-enabled at runtime via the **/sys/devices/cpu/smt/control** interface. If **FORCE** is not specified, users with sufficient permissions can re-enable or disable SMT at runtime.

Additionally, the playbook provides a **RESET=1** argument which will remove the above mitigations, and return the system to its default behavior of enabled SMT and conditional L1 data cache flushes on VM enter. A reboot is necessary after using **RESET=1**.

To use *CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml*, specify the features you want to set in extra vars, as well as the systems you'd like to target in the **HOSTS** variable. For example:

To turn off SMT, but allow runtime changes, and to leave the default behavior of conditional L1 data cache flushes:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers NOSMT=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

To apply all mitigations and prevent runtime changes:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=vmserver01 FLUSH=1 NOSMT=1 FORCE=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

To reset the L1TF settings to their default state:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers RESET=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

## Take Action

Red Hat customers running affected versions of these Red Hat products are strongly recommended to update them as soon as errata are available. Customers are urged to apply the available updates immediately and enable the mitigations as they feel appropriate.

The order the patches are applied is not important, but after updating firmware and hypervisors, every system/virtual machine will need to power off and restart to recognize a new hardware type.

## Mitigation

Current mitigations include applying vendor software updates combined with hardware OEMs CPU microcode/firmware. All Red Hat customers should apply vendor solutions to patch their CPUs, system BIOS (as needed), and update the kernel as soon as patches are available.  All mitigations are enabled by default with the exception of disabling Hyper-Threading, which customers must take explicit manual steps to turn off. Customers are advised to take a risk-based approach in reviewing and reacting to this issue. Customers will need to assess the security risk and the range of mitigations and their performance impact to create mitigation strategy.  Systems that require high degrees of security and trust should be addressed first, and should be isolated from untrusted systems until such time as treatments can be applied to those systems to reduce the risk of exploit. Customers desiring to completely mitigate this issue will need to consider more securely managing and possibly disabling Hyper-Threading to close off all attack vectors.

### Mitigation/Remediation:

Complete mitigation of the L1 Terminal Fault requires three changes; Page Table Inversion (a small change to the kernel which is provided and enabled by default in updated kernels), Flushing the L1 Data Cache when switching between virtual machines, and possibly disabling SMT. Each of these changes independently provides some protection against different parts of an attack.

Page Table Inversion (which is NOT the same as the Page Table Isolation added in mitigating Meltdown) is performed by default when manipulating not present page table entries in updated kernels provided by Red Hat.

Flushing the L1 Data Cache is optional and can be implemented by updated microcode or by the updated kernel. It is currently enabled by default when running virtualized guest machines, but can be controlled by the user through kernel parameters.

SMT Disable is optionally used to secure an untrusted shared environment running virtual machines. This is implemented through software changes to the kernel to add a new control interface. It is also possible to disable Intel Hyper-threading in the BIOS firmware, but this is much more cumbersome and is not the recommended approach.

Remediation requires this three-pronged approach because the flaw has three contributing factors:

1. Not Present (**P flag = 0**) page table entry (PTE) OR one which has **reserved bits set** holds an uninitialised physical address. And that physical address is cached into the L1 data cache.
2. Updates caused by the speculative operations to the L1 data cache are not cleared. They can be observed by a subsequent process.
3. Simultaneous multi-threads (SMT) share the execution engine and the on-chip processor caches like L1 data and TLB caches.

### Page Table Inversion:

The processor speculatively accesses physical address from a Not Present PTE and if the contents of this physical address are cached into the L1 data cache, the memory access succeeds. Therefore, if the physical address’ contents were not cached, then said memory access would not leak data. The Page Table Inversion mitigation, updates the physical address in the Not Present PTEs, by setting the high order address bits, such that it points to a physical address that is not in memory and/or is uncacheable. Thus its contents can not be present in the L1 data cache.

Updated kernel package shows the current status of the system via the sysfs interface as shown:

> # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
> Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: SMT vulnerable, L1D conditional cache flushes
> #

### Flush L1 Data Cache:

Intel x86 processors offer a IA32\_FLUSH\_CMD Machine Specific Register (MSR), when updated microcode is installed on the system. It can be used to invalidate L1 data cache. The support for IA32\_FLUSH\_CMD MSR can be seen from /proc/cpuinfo flags OR via the lscpu(1) command which lists CPU flags:

> # lscpu
> Flags:    … ssbd ibrs ibpb stibp spec\_ctrl intel\_stibp **flush\_l1d**
> #

If **flush\_l1d** flag is not available, please confirm that you have the updated microcode installed on the system and that system has been rebooted.

In case the updated microcode is not installed, **flush\_l1d** flag will not be available. The updated kernel would still flush the L1 data cache in software. This will be slower compared to the hardware **flush\_l1d** interface.

Updated kernel package introduces the following kernel and KVM module parameters to control L1TF mitigations:

> l1tf=[full/full,force/flush/flush,nosmt/flush,nowarn/off]

This is a kernel boot parameter to control mitigation of the L1TF issue on the affected CPUs. It can take one of the following values

> full:  enables all mitigations for the L1TF issue.

* Enables L1 data cache flush on every VM entry operation.
* Disables Hyper-Threading (SMT).

Both L1 data cache flush and SMT can be controlled at run time, after boot, via the sysfs interface.

> full,force: enables all mitigations for the L1TF issue.

* Enables L1 data cache flush on every VM entry operation.
* Disables Hyper-Threading (SMT).

The force parameter here prevents users from disabling above L1TF mitigations via the sysfs interface. Users cannot enable SMT at run time.

> flush: only enable L1 data cache flush

* Enables the default L1 data cache flush mitigation, which is to conditionally flush the L1 data cache.
* Does not disable Hyper-Threading (SMT).

Both can still be controlled via the sysfs interface. The hypervisor (KVM) issues a warning if a guest is started with insecure configurations like SMT enabled OR L1 data cache flush disabled.

> flush,nosmt: disables the Hyper-Threading (SMT)

* Enable conditional L1 data cache flush mitigation.
* Disable Hyper-Threading (SMT)

Both can still be controlled via the sysfs interface. The hypervisor (KVM) issues a warning if a guest is started with insecure configurations like SMT enabled OR L1 data cache flush disabled.

> flush,nowarn: similar to the flush option above, except the KVM module warnings about guests running with insecure configurations are suppressed.

> off: disables hypervisor mitigations, ie. KVM won’t flush the L1 data cache on VM entry.

Default l1tf boot parameter value is set to the flush mitigation option above.

kvm-intel.vmentry\_l1d\_flush: KVM module parameter to control L1 data cache flush operations on each VM entry. It can have possible values as shown:

always     L1D cache flush on every VMENTER.
   cond       Conditional L1D cache flush.
   never      Disable the L1D cache flush mitigation.

cond is trying to avoid L1D cache flushes on VMENTER if the code executed between VMEXIT and VMENTER is considered safe, i.e. is not bringing any
interesting information into L1D which might be exploited.

# cat  /sys/module/kvm\_intel/parameters/vmentry\_l1d\_flush
       cond
       #

This parameter is set to cond by default; it performs an L1 Data Cache flush upon selective VM entry instances. This should help to reduce the performance impact of the L1 data cache flush.

### Control SMT:

When simultaneous multithreading or Hyper-Threading technology is in use, unrelated threads running on the same core and sharing processor cache resources can read each other’s data from the L1 data cache by leveraging the L1TF issue. If you are running an untrusted shared environment you will want to consider disabling SMT as part of your mitigation strategy. Generally SMT can be enabled or disabled from system Bios.

The updated kernel packages introduce the new command line parameter nosmt.

> nosmt: Disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT) . It can be re-enabled at run time via a sysfs interface.
>
> nosmt=force: Disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT). It can not be re-enabled at run time.

NOTE: There are controls in the kernel sysfs interface to manage multithreading at run time. Though their use can lead to erroneous behavior when SMT is re-enabled. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use either the BIOS settings or the kernel boot parameters listed above to enable/disable SMT. The runtime flags are described here only as a reference:

> /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active
> /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control

The **active** file above is a read-only interface. When the **active** file contains ‘**1**’, it means that SMT is enabled and sibling threads are online. When the kernel is booted with the ‘**nosmt**’ parameter, it essentially writes ‘**0**’ to the **active** file above.

The control file noted above is a read/write interface to control SMT. It can have the following values:

> on             :  SMT is enabled. Enable sibling threads if they were offline.
> off            :  SMT is disabled. Disable sibling threads if they were online.
> forceoff :  SMT is forcibly disabled and cannot be changed. It cannot be
>                  Controlled or changed at run time.
> notsupported: the processor does not support Hyper-Threading (SMT).

### Disable EPT:

Disabling Extended Page Tables (EPT) for KVM guests mitigates the L1TF issue, because it essentially lets the VMM/Hypervisor manage the address translations for the guest. If EPT is disabled, one does not need to disable Hyper-Threads (SMT) and flush L1 data cache as listed above.

**Please note**: disabling EPT will significantly hamper the system performance. It may not be a viable option.

EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the **kvm-intel.ept** parameter. It is enabled by default.

**Red Hat recommends customers apply the microcode/firmware update provided by your hardware or CPU vendor and also install these updated kernels as soon as possible. Software updates can be applied independently from the hardware microcode, but will not take effect until the CPU firmware has been updated.**

### Tuned

The new L1TF kernels provide controls to allow the user to disable Hyper-Threading either at runtime or at kernel boot time.  If either of those two methods are used, and the system is running any one of the following four tuned profiles:

cpu-partitioning
      realtime
      realtime-virtual-host
      realtime-virtual-guest

then an updated tuned will be needed.  This only impacts RHEL 7.4z and 7.5z. An updated tuned is not needed if Hyper-Threading is disabled in the BIOS.

# Security Advisory - SegmentSmack Vulnerability in Linux Kernel

* SA No:huawei-sa-20181031-02-linux
* Initial Release Date:
  Oct 31, 2018
* Last Release Date:
  Aug 05, 2020

Summary

There is a DoS vulnerability in the Linux Kernel versions 4.9+ known as a SegmentSmack attack. Remote attackers may send TCP packets to Linux kernel to make it calls the very expensive functions tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() of the affected device which can lead to a denial of service. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2018-08114)

This vulnerability has been assigned a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2018-5390.

Huawei has released software updates to fix this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

Impact

A remote attacker may be able to trigger a denial-of-service condition.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv3 scoring system (<http://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document>).

Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Temporal Score: 6.5 (E:U/RL:O/RC:C)

Overall Score: 6.5

Technique Details

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker could continuous send two-way TCP sessions to the affected device.

Vulnerability details:

Remote attackers may send TCP packets to Linux kernel to make it calls the very expensive functions tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() of the affected device which can lead to a denial of service. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2791)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391.

Bug Fix(es):

* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625330)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.4 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1575065](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1575065)
  - CVE-2018-10675 kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact
* [BZ - 1601704](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1601704)
  - CVE-2018-5390 kernel: TCP segments with random offsets allow a remote denial of service (SegmentSmack)
* [BZ - 1609664](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1609664)
  - CVE-2018-5391 kernel: IP fragments with random offsets allow a remote denial of service (FragmentSmack)

# USN-3763-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

11 September 2018

The system could be made to crash if it received specially crafted
network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug.

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Important: redhat-virtualization-host security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2403)

## Topic

An update for redhat-release-virtualization-host and redhat-virtualization-host is now available for Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646 and Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX

timers subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2017-18344](/security/CVE-2017-18344))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the IP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packet fragments. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5391](/security/CVE-2018-5391))

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2789)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-693.39.1 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1616431)
* Previously, preemption was enabled too early after a context switch. If a task was migrated to another CPU after a context switch, a mismatch between CPU and runqueue during load balancing sometimes occurred. Consequently, a runnable task on an idle CPU failed to run, and the operating system became unresponsive. This update disables preemption in the schedule\_tail() function. As a result, CPU migration during post-schedule processing no longer occurs, which prevents the above mismatch. The operating system no longer hangs due to this bug. (BZ#1618466)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* MRG Realtime 2 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1601704](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1601704)
  - CVE-2018-5390 kernel: TCP segments with random offsets allow a remote denial of service (SegmentSmack)
* [BZ - 1616431](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1616431)
  - update the MRG 2.5.z 3.10 kernel-rt sources
* [BZ - 1618466](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1618466)
  - RT system hang due to wrong of rq's nr\_running [MRG-RT]

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

"text": "On August 6, 2018, the Vulnerability Coordination team of the National Cyber Security Centre of Finland (NCSC-FI) and the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) disclosed vulnerabilities in the TCP stacks that are used by the Linux and FreeBSD kernels. These vulnerabilities are publicly known as SegmentSmack.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. An attack could be executed by using low transfer rates of TCP packets, unlike typical distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to inefficient TCP reassembly algorithms in the TCP stacks that are used by the affected kernels. Linux Kernel Versions 4.9 and later and all supported versions of the FreeBSD kernel are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a stream of packets that are designed to trigger the issue in an established TCP session with an affected device. A sustained DoS condition requires the attacker to maintain a continuous stream of malicious traffic. Due to the required use of an established session, an attack cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp\"]"

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-31 20:03:19 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels with commit b6a2fea39318 ("mm: variable length argument support", from July 19, 2007) but without commit da029c11e6b1 ("exec:Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM", from July 7, 2017). An integer overflow in the Linux kernel's create_elf_tables() function. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a SUID-root binary and obtain full root privileges.   Referenced commits: b6a2fea39318 ("mm: variable length argument support", from July 19, 2007) <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba>  da029c11e6b1 ("exec: Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM", from July 7, 2017)  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/da029c11e6b12f321f36dac8771e833b65cec962>  Additional references: <https://www.qualys.com/2018/09/25/cve-2018-14634/mutagen-astronomy-integer-overflow-linux-create_elf_tables-cve-2018-14634.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-09-03 15:05:58 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c9)  Petr Matousek    2018-09-25 15:24:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect 32-bit systems as they do not have a large enough address space to exploit this flaw.  Systems with less than 32GB of memory are very unlikely to be affected by this issue due to memory demands during exploitation.  This issue does not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  This issue affects the version of the kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 will address this issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c10)  Petr Matousek    2018-09-25 15:27:52 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate the issue:  Enable and install kernel-debuginfo packages as per <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/666123>  1) On the host, save the following in a file with the ".stp" extension:  // [CVE-2018-14634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-14634) // // Theory of operations: adjust the thread's # rlimit-in-effect around // calls to the vulnerable get_arg_page() function so as to encompass // the newly required _STK_LIM / 4 * 3 maximum.  // Complication: the rlimit is stored in a current-> structure that // is shared across the threads of the process.  They may concurrently // invoke this operation.  function clamp_stack_rlim_cur:long () %{   struct rlimit *rlim = current->signal->rlim;   unsigned long rlim_cur = READ_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur);    unsigned long limit = _STK_LIM / 4 * 3;   limit *= 4; // multiply it back up, to the scale used by rlim_cur    if (rlim_cur > limit) {     WRITE_ONCE(rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur, limit);     STAP_RETURN(limit);   } else     STAP_RETURN(0); %}  probe kernel.function("copy_strings").call {   l = clamp_stack_rlim_cur()    if (l)      printf("lowered process %s(%d) STACK rlim_cur to %p\n",             execname(), pid(), l) }  probe begin { 	printf("CVE-2018-14634 mitigation loaded\n")  }  probe end { 	printf("CVE-2018-14634 mitigation unloaded\n") }  2) Install the "systemtap" package and any required dependencies. Refer to the "2. Using SystemTap" chapter in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux "SystemTap Beginners Guide" document, available from docs.redhat.com, for information on installing the required -debuginfo and matching kernel-devel packages  3) Run the "stap -g [filename-from-step-1].stp" command as root.  If the host is rebooted, the changes will be lost and the script must be run again.   Alternatively, build the systemtap script on a development system with "stap -g -p 4 [filename-from-step-1].stp", distribute the resulting kernel module to all affected systems, and run "staprun -L <module>" on those. When using this approach only systemtap-runtime package is required on the affected systems. Please notice that the kernel version must be the same across all systems.   This may not be a suitable workaround if your application uses massive amounts of stack space. Please consider this if there are any adverse affects when running this mitigation.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-25 19:06:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2748 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2748](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2748)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-25 19:07:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:2763 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2763](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2763)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c14)  Alexander Peslyak    2018-09-26 12:05:43 UTC  ``` Petr, am I correct that the systemtap mitigation is racy, and can be bypassed by a more elaborate exploit that would reset rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur back to a high enough value from another thread of the invoking process (perhaps it'd be doing that in a busy loop)? This came up in discussions of a similar kernel patch, resulting in patches to the patch, last year. I wonder if we can come up with a simple yet non-racy systemtap mitigation. Maybe also trap setrlimit() and impose a higher limit there that's enough to prevent the attack yet unlikely to break desirable uses.  Also, I'm curious - why exactly is RHEL5 unaffected?

Setting a big number instead of unlimited in /etc/security/limits.conf for stack does not seem to matter; still set to 30720 by the SystemTap script.  Before applying:  # ssh n1 ulimit -s unlimited  # ssh n1 staprun -L CVE-2018-14634-mitigation/2.6.32-754.3.5.el6.x86_64/stap_4d64dccb8f09ef10871f7b00522c1ff7_3076.ko  # ssh n1 ulimit -s 30720  Is it supposed to be like this?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c16)  Alexander Peslyak    2018-09-26 19:34:38 UTC  ``` I can't speak about the intent, but the behavior Kent describes is consistent with my reading of the SystemTap mitigation script. The specific number 30720 is a result of what I think is a bug-turned-feature, in "limit *= 4; // multiply it back up, to the scale used by rlim_cur". This doesn't make sense to me in its current context (I guess this line is a leftover from prior edits of the script), but the multiplication results in the limit being not so low (would have been 3/4 of the default 10 MiB stack limit otherwise, which is more likely to break some applications and is unnecessarily strict to prevent exploitation of this specific issue). I think a forced limit of 30 MiB is sane, unless you have specific applications that require a higher limit (in which case you can edit the SystemTap script accordingly - a limit of a few hundred MiB would still mitigate the original issue).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c18)  Wade Mealing    2018-09-27 00:35:34 UTC  ``` This will not modifiy the live limit shown by ulimit command.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c20)  Wade Mealing    2018-09-27 02:40:09 UTC  ``` Gday Alexander,  I take responsibility for the systemtap script, Petr just made it public.    > am I correct that the systemtap mitigation is racy, and can be bypassed by a more elaborate exploit that would reset rlim[RLIMIT_STACK].rlim_cur back to a high enough value from another thread of the invoking process (perhaps it'd be doing that in a busy loop)?

I don't understand what you mean by "This will not modifiy the live limit shown by ulimit command." If you're referring to the effect of the SystemTap mitigation, then it's actually expected to modify that, visibly I think due to bash calling getrlimit(), and it's been reported that way in a comment above.  In last year's discussions (and in the grsecurity patch much earlier), the only reason for the rlimit to be lowered on exec was to apply that selectively to SUID/SGID exec, rather than to all execs. Since you're doing it for all execs anyway, a simple workaround and end-user can use is to lower the hard limit in /etc/security/limits.conf with a line like this:  * hard stack 30720  This will apply to user logins (e.g., via SSH), but unfortunately not to various privsep child processes of services, etc., unless and until those services are manually restarted by someone logged in as root. It might or might not apply to various non-login ways that a user can invoke a command - e.g., via .forward files - depending on whether those services start PAM sessions for those command invocations or not. Thus, a more complete fix would (also) include adding "ulimit -Hs 30720" to an early system bootup script from where all other service startup scripts are invoked, but do we still have anything like that with systemd? I'm not familiar with systemd.  And this brings us back to a possible SystemTap, where I think you could lower both the hard and the soft limit. There's no point in allowing a higher hard limit if you'd be resetting the soft limit on each exec anyway. Not to be racy against a concurrent setrlimit(), which might be past its hard limit check already, you'd need to also intercept setrlimit() calls (is there a compat version of that syscall? if so, that as well) and impose the limit on its inputs. OTOH, if someone doesn't mind rebooting with the SystemTap loaded early on at bootup, then the race wouldn't matter anymore once we're setting both the hard and the soft limit on each exec - the hard limit would get inherited by all child processes, thereby preventing a concurrent setrlimit() attack on the already booted up system.  Yes, "working on this may have diminishing returns as the errata has already started shipping." Maybe it's more important to prepare better instructions for setup of SystemTap-based mitigations for next time one is needed. How can one have a SystemTap-based mitigation re-applied on system bootup early on? A hack I once used on a RHEL6'ish system is this:  # tail -4 /etc/sysconfig/sshd MOD=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/dirtycow.ko if [ -e $MOD ]; then 	staprun -L $MOD fi  Perhaps Red Hat should start recommending something like this, or come up with an official way for SystemTap-based mitigations to be loaded on system bootup (e.g., have a "service" that would do that, and would be guaranteed to start up before things such as sshd, crond, MTAs, etc. - those that may invoke user-supplied programs as part of their normal functionality).  Regarding RHEL5, I know why our OpenVZ/RHEL5-based kernels on Owl are unaffected since we migrated to those back in 2010 - I lowered MAX_ARG_STRINGS and introduced an extra check into get_arg_pages() back then (no, this isn't in OpenVZ upstream, it's Owl-specific unfortunately) - but I was surprised to hear yours are unaffected either. Maybe there's something else preventing the attack on those kernels (good) or on the specific system you tested on (bad; e.g., 32 GB could somehow not be allocated in the kernel when total RAM isn't a lot higher than that).  Thanks again for your replies.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c25)  Yogendra Jog    2018-10-03 12:36:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/mutagen-astronomy> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/09/25/4>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1624498#c28)  Frank Ch.

Subject: Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft

Hi all,

Per our current policy and precedents, I see no valid reasons not to
subscribe Microsoft (or part(s) of it, see below) to linux-distros.  So
I intend to figure out some detail and proceed with the subscription.

The only voiced reasons not to, such as in Georgi Guninski's posting and
in comments on some technology news sites that covered Microsoft's
request, are irrelevant per our currently specified membership criteria.

Besides, (at least to me) Microsoft doesn't look all that different from
many other large corporations, including some which already have their
Linux distro teams represented on the list.  Microsoft has a lasting
stigma from its past actions from long ago.  IMO, we shouldn't let that
result in a biased decision against current Microsoft, effectively
favoring other corporations who might not be any better currently, but
just don't have that established stigma.

The oldest of these is August 8, 2018, which is just 1 month short of
the 1 year term.  I suppose we could either give Microsoft this 1 month
off as you suggest based on Microsoft's track record of promptly dealing
with security issues in non-Linux products, or subscribe Microsoft to
linux-distros in August 2019 (or later).

More importantly, maybe we shouldn't list "Microsoft" as a member of
linux-distros.  Microsoft is so much more than the recent Linux-based
products and services.  We similarly list "Amazon Linux AMI" rather than
"Amazon", and "Chrome OS" rather than "Google" (and we had separately
listed "Android", which has since unsubscribed), and "Ubuntu" rather
than "Canonical".  OTOH, we were not as careful to list proper products,
etc. for some others such as "Oracle".

If we list "Microsoft", this might be especially confusing since issues
being reported might also be relevant to Windows.  The reporters need to
know they're not reaching Windows security team unless they specifically
authorize that.

Any suggestions on the above?

Regardless, the list policy only allows use of the information for
"getting the issue fixed for your distro's users and, only in rare
extreme cases, for deployment of maximally non-revealing changes to
maintain security of your distro's infrastructure most essential to the
distro users' security in face of the security issue being dealt with.
The need-to-know condition is met only if the person needs to
participate in one of these two activities."  This is meant to preclude
sharing within the organization beyond its parts responsible for the
"distro" the organization is subscribed for.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:26 UTC  ``` A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.  External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/641765>  A fix is a merge commit in the Linux kernel tree:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f>  consisting of the following commits:  7969e5c40dfd04799d4341f1b7cd266b6e47f227 385114dec8a49b5e5945e77ba7de6356106713f4 fa0f527358bd900ef92f925878ed6bfbd51305cc   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-07-30 07:11:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c13)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-08 10:09:14 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  One may change the default 4MB and 3MB values of net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh (and their ipv6 counterparts net.ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh and net.ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh) to 256 kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. Tests show some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware, configuration and environment.  There can be some impact on performance though, due to ipfrag_high_thresh of 262144 bytes, as only two 64K fragments can fit in the reassembly queue at the same time. For example, there is a risk of breaking applications that rely on large UDP packets.  See the Mitigation section in the <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061> article for the script to quickly change to/from default and lower settings.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c16)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 20:09:40 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1616059](show_bug.cgi?id=1616059 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14641 CVE-2018-5391 kernel: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c18)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-14 21:28:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue. Updates will be released as they become available. For additional information, please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061>  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9. Future kernel updates for the respective releases will address this issue.  This issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but to a lesser degree. As such, the issue severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate. This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle and the issue severity.

Forbes    2018-08-15 20:07:43 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 4.17.13 stable kernel updates.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c24)  hayg    2018-08-30 00:12:29 UTC  ``` Has Redhat taken into account the update from CERT? <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/641765> says:  "Update: Further testing shows that these mitigations are not a 100% fix. A significantly strong attack will still result in a denial of service condition."  In my own testing the memory mitigations are not a sufficient fix. It appears only the inclusion of this commit truly fixes the problem: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f>  I'm seeing this being largely ignored by Debian for example and I'm afraid that Redhat may not be aware either.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c25)  Frank Liu    2018-08-30 07:28:58 UTC  ``` Looking at this bugzilla ticket, there have been no update for weeks. I have to agree with you that this bug is not treated as serious.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c26)  Vladis Dronov    2018-08-30 21:34:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to hayg from [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c24)) > In my own testing the memory mitigations are not a sufficient fix.  as the "Mitigation:" ([Comment#13](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c13)) section and <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3553061> mention, "Tests show some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware, configuration and environment". so, yes, a mitigation is not a complete fix.  > It appears only the inclusion of this commit truly fixes the problem: > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/> > ?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f  as the "Description" ([Comment#0](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c0)) section mentions, "A fix is a merge commit in the Linux kernel tree: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c30f1fc041b74ecdb072dd44f858750414b8b19f>". so, yes, this merge commit is considered as a fix for the flaw.  the fix is currently being included in the Red Hat's products.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c27)  hayg    2018-08-31 01:03:49 UTC  ``` Nice!

Or is it vulnerability not as significant? I see most other distributions, including Fedora, have already issued the fix, using upstream patch.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1609664#c33)  Vladis Dronov    2018-09-25 11:03:44 UTC  ``` The fix for this flaw is scheduled to be released in the next kernel update of RHEL-6 and RHEL-7.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 284 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](//support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2489117.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 62 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  57 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2019verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2466391.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2466391.1).

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 5 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2395)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* kernel: crypto: privilege escalation in skcipher\_recvmsg function (CVE-2017-13215)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: race condition in snd\_seq\_write() may lead to UAF or OOB access (CVE-2018-7566)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646; Vladimir Kiriansky (MIT) and Carl Waldspurger (Carl Waldspurger Consulting) for reporting CVE-2018-3693; and Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to the 3.10.0-862.10.2 source tree, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#1594915)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

If a task was migrated to another CPU after a context switch, a mismatch between CPU and runqueue during load balancing sometimes occurred. Consequently, a runnable task on an idle CPU failed to run, and the operating system became unresponsive. This update disables preemption in the schedule\_tail() function. As a result, CPU migration during post-schedule processing no longer occurs, which prevents the above mismatch. The operating system no longer hangs due to this bug. | | | Clone Of: | [1608672](show_bug.cgi?id=1608672 "CLOSED ERRATA - RT system hang due to wrong of rq's nr_running") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-09-25 20:21:47 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryLinux and FreeBSD Kernels TCP Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerabilities Affecting Cisco Products: August 2018 High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp  First Published: 2018 August 24 21:30 GMT  Last Updated:  2018 November 6 18:09 GMT  Version 1.7:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2018-5390 CVE-2018-6922     CWE-400          CVE-2018-5390 CVE-2018-6922     CWE-400       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp/csaf/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp.json)   Email      Summary  * On August 6, 2018, the Vulnerability Coordination team of the National Cyber Security Centre of Finland (NCSC-FI) and the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) disclosed vulnerabilities in the TCP stacks that are used by the Linux and FreeBSD kernels. These vulnerabilities are publicly known as *SegmentSmack*.  The vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. An attack could be executed by using low transfer rates of TCP packets, unlike typical distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.  The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient TCP reassembly algorithms in the TCP stacks that are used by the affected kernels. Linux Kernel Versions 4.9 and later and all supported versions of the FreeBSD kernel are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a stream of packets that are designed to trigger the issue in an established TCP session with an affected device. A sustained DoS condition requires the attacker to maintain a continuous stream of malicious traffic. Due to the required use of an established session, an attack cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180824-linux-tcp>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products and services may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product or service. The bugs are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID) and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.  Any product or service not listed in the “Vulnerable Products” section of this advisory is to   be considered not vulnerable.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2948)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

## TCP implementations vulnerable to Denial of Service

#### Vulnerability Note VU#962459

Original Release Date: 2018-08-06 | Last Revised: 2018-09-14

---

### Overview

The Linux kernel versions 4.9+ and supported versions of FreeBSD are vulnerable to denial of service conditions with low rates of specially modified packets.

### Description

| [**CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) - CVE-2018-5390  Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service.[**CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) - CVE-2018-6922A TCP data structure in supported versions of FreeBSD (11, 11.1, 11.2, 10, and 10.4) use an inefficient algorithm to reassemble the data. For both vulnerabilities, an attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An remote attacker may be able to trigger a denial-of-service condition against a system with an available open port. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Patches for the Linux kernel are available to address the vulnerability.Patches for FreeBSD are available to address the vulnerability. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1585005#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2018-06-01 06:40:12 UTC  ``` Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation.  The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process.  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights 补丁分析

识别并修复受此公告影响的系统。

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2924)

## 标题

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625334)
* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629633)

## 解决方案

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2790)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the early microcode updater in the kernel was trying to perform a microcode update on virtualized guests. As a consequence, the virtualized guests sometimes mishandled the request to perform the microcode update and became unresponsive in the early boot stage. This update applies an upstream patch to avoid the early microcode update when running under a hypervisor. As a result, no kernel freezes appear in the described scenario. (BZ#1618386)

## Solution

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2384)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* kernel: crypto: privilege escalation in skcipher\_recvmsg function (CVE-2017-13215)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: race condition in snd\_seq\_write() may lead to UAF or OOB access (CVE-2018-7566)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646; Vladimir Kiriansky (MIT) and Carl Waldspurger (Carl Waldspurger Consulting) for reporting CVE-2018-3693; and Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390.

Bug Fix(es):

These updated kernel packages include also numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of the bug fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions in the related Knowledge Article:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3527791>

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-5391

The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially
modiﬁed packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service
condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation
have been discovered and ﬁxed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became
exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size.

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3742-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to expose sensitive

information (memory from other guests or the host OS). ([CVE-2018-3646](/security/CVE-2018-3646))

It was discovered that memory present in the L1 data cache of an Intel CPU

core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the CPU

core. This vulnerability is also known as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF). A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (memory from the

kernel or other processes). ([CVE-2018-3620](/security/CVE-2018-3620))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read in the POSIX timers

subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2017-18344](/security/CVE-2017-18344))

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2018-5390](/security/CVE-2018-5390))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-155.206~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-155-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-155.206~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.155.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.155.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-155.206~precise1)

Please note that the recommended mitigation for CVE-2018-3646 involves

updating processor microcode in addition to updating the kernel;

however, the kernel includes a fallback for processors that have not

received microcode updates.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Affected CVE

CVE-2018-5390

Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2018-686

Component : Kernel

Revision : 1.0: Final

Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and

tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service. An attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port. Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. A remote attacker may be able to trigger a denial-of-service condition against a system with an available open port. More information at: https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/962459

Affected Products

No Brocade Fibre Channel technology products from Broadcom are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Note
Brocade Manageability products are not vulnerable to CVE-2018-5390. However, since the environnement that runs the products is not under Brocade's control, Brocade recommends Customers to apply recommendation from the vendors.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2933)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: mm: use-after-free in do\_get\_mempolicy function allows local DoS or other unspecified impact (CVE-2018-10675)
* kernel: Integer overflow in Linux's create\_elf\_tables function (CVE-2018-14634)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-14634.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, invalid headers in the sk\_buff struct led to an indefinite loop in the tcp\_collapse() function. As a consequence, the system became unresponsive. This update backports the upstream changes that remove the problematic code in tcp\_collapse(). As a result, the system no longer hangs in the described scenario. (BZ#1619630)
* After updating the system to prevent the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) vulnerability, only one thread was detected on systems that offer processing of two threads on a single processor core. With this update, the "\_\_max\_smt\_threads()" function has been fixed. As a result, both threads are now detected correctly in the described situation. (BZ#1625333)
* Previously, a kernel panic occurred when the kernel tried to make an out of bound access to the array that describes the L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) mitigation state on systems without Extended Page Tables (EPT) support. This update extends the array of mitigation states to cover all the states, which effectively prevents out of bound array access. Also, this update enables rejecting invalid, irrelevant values, that might be erroneously provided by the userspace. As a result, the kernel no longer panics in the described scenario. (BZ#1629632)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

Package        : linux-4.9
Version        : 4.9.110-3+deb9u2~deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-5390 CVE-2018-5391 CVE-2018-13405
Debian Bug     : 893393 903122 903767 903776 903838 903914

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2018-5390 (SegmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that a remote attacker can trigger the
    worst case code paths for TCP stream reassembly with low rates of
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This is mitigated by reducing the default limits on memory usage
    for incomplete fragmented packets.  The same mitigation can be
    achieved without the need to reboot, by setting the sysctls:

    net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144
    net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608
    net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608

    The default values may still be increased by local configuration
    if necessary.

CVE-2018-13405

    Jann Horn discovered that the inode_init_owner function in
    fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to create files
    with an unintended group ownership allowing attackers to escalate
    privileges by making a plain file executable and SGID.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u2~deb8u1. This update includes fixes for several
regressions in the latest point release.

The earlier version 4.9.110-3+deb9u1~deb8u1 included all the above
fixes except for CVE-2018-5391, which may be mitigated as explained
above.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# USN-3732-2: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerability

6 August 2018

The system could be made unavailable if it received specially crafted
network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3732-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Juha-Matti Tilli discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel

performed algorithmically expensive operations in some situations when

handling incoming packets. A remote attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1015-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.15.0-1015.15~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.15.0-1015.15~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-30-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-30-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-30.32~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
