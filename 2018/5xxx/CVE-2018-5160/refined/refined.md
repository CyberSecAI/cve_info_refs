{
  "CVE-2018-5160": {
    "Description": "WebRTC can use a `WrappedI420Buffer` pixel buffer but the owning image object can be freed while it is still in use. This can result in the WebRTC encoder using uninitialized memory, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `WrappedI420Buffer` in MediaPipeline can outlive the PlanarYCbCrImage that owns the actual pixel buffer, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Uninitialized memory use"
    ],
    "Impact": "The WebRTC encoder could use uninitialized memory, potentially resulting in an exploitable crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability in WebRTC via a crafted website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted website that triggers the vulnerability."
